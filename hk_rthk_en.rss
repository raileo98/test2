<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary has confirmed that non-permanent judge Beverley McLachlin, who sits on the city’s top court, will not stay on when her term expires at the end of July this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madam McLachlin, who once served as the Chief Justice of Canada, has been a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July 2021, the former Canadian top judge had her term extended for three more years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian media cited Madam McLachlin as saying that she had turned 80 years old and would end her term as scheduled in late July, adding that she had confidence in the court's judicial independence and determination to maintain the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government thanked the judge for her contribution to Hong Kong's judicial system, as well as her objective appraisal of the rule of law in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in a statement that Madam McLachlin had reiterated "her confidence in the members of the court, their independence, and their determination to uphold the rule of law".

 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday eked out record closing highs, although investors were cautious ahead of this week's consumer prices report, a Federal Reserve policy announcement and Apple's developer conference.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Providing some support to the Nasdaq and S&P 500, Nvidia shares ended up 0.7 percent, the session after a 10-for-one stock split. Some investors now believe the chip-maker might be included in the blue-chip Dow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Price Index report for May is due on Wednesday, along with the conclusion of the Fed's two-day policy meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank, which will release updated economic and policy projections, is expected to hold interest rates steady. Investors will look for clues on when the US central bank may begin to cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.18 percent to 38,868, the S&P 500 gained 0.26 percent to 5,360, and the Nasdaq added 0.35 percent to 17,192. (Reuters)

    Frost discovered on top of giant Mars volcanoes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This handout photo from the ESA shows a 3D model of the Olympus Mons volcano.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Early morning frost has been detected on the peaks of massive volcanoes on Mars, an unexpected discovery about the dispersal of water on Mars that could one day prove essential for human exploration, scientists said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The early morning frost was spotted in images taken by the European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter, according to a study published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The immense volcanoes are in the Tharsis plateau, an elevated region nearly 5,000 kilometres wide near the Martian equator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The volcanoes have been extinct for millions of years. Among them is the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is almost three times taller than Mount Everest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The discovery came by chance – no one expected to find frost in this region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We thought it was impossible for frost to form around Mars's equator," lead study author Adomas Valantinas said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plenty of sunshine and a thin atmosphere mean the temperature is relatively warm up there, "unlike what we see on Earth, where you might expect to see frosty peaks," the researcher at Brown University in the United States said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also little water in the atmosphere near the Martian equator, making condensation less likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other space probes have observed frost but in wetter regions – notably the northern plains," study co-author Frederic Schmidt of France's Paris-Saclay University said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been orbiting Mars since 2018, was able to take images when the first rays of the Sun crossed over the tops of the volcanoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We saw a shiny, blue deposit there, a particular texture that we only see in the early morning and during the cold seasons," Schmidt said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The layer of the ice is only the thickness of a hair – and it does not last long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there is about 150,000 tonnes of water – equivalent to 60 Olympic swimming pools – in the daily frost at the summits of volcanoes Olympus Mons, Arsia Mons, Ascraeus Mons and Ceraunius Tholus, the ESA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers suggested the frost is caused by a micro-climate that forms inside the calderas of the huge volcanoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As wind whips up the sides of the volcanoes, it brings "relatively moist air from near the surface up to higher altitudes, where it condenses and settles as frost," study co-author Nicolas Thomas explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We actually see this happening on Earth and other parts of Mars," said Thomas, who works on the Trace Gas Orbiter's imaging system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modelling how these frosts form "could allow scientists to reveal more of Mars's remaining secrets, including where water exists and how it moves between reservoirs," the ESA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This may prove crucial for planned missions that could see humans set foot on Martian soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We could recover water from the frost for human consumption, or launch rockets from Mars by separating the oxygen and hydrogen molecules," Schmidt said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mapping the location of water on Mars – which only exists as ice or vapour – could also be key in the search for signs of extra-terrestrial life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liquid water is considered one of the essential ingredients for life on other planets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A military plane carrying Malawi's vice president and nine others went missing on Monday and a search was underway, the president's office said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plane carrying 51-year-old Vice President Saulos Chilima left the capital, Lilongwe, but failed to make its scheduled landing at Mzuzu International Airport about 370 kilometres to the north around 45 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aviation authorities lost contact with the plane when it “went off radar,” the statement from Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera's office said. Chakwera ordered a search operation and cancelled a trip to the Bahamas, his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All efforts to make contact with the aircraft since it went off radar have failed thus far," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chakwera was informed of the missing plane by General Valentino Phiri, the head of the Malawian armed forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president had ordered national and local authorities to “conduct an immediate search and rescue operation to locate the whereabouts of the aircraft,” his office said. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The euro recoiled on Monday after a far-right surge in weekend EU polls sparked a general election in France, although analysts believe the single currency will remain resilient.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shared eurozone unit was down 0.3 percent at US$1.0736 around 1415 GMT, while the Paris CAC 40 stocks index slumped 1.9 percent in shock over President Emmanuel Macron's election call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors fretted over the region's political "shift to the Far Right," as well as the "surprise factor" of a snap general election in France, according to XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron announced on Sunday that he was dissolving the National Assembly, or French Parliament's lower house, after news that far-right parties including National Rally (NR) took almost 40 percent of the French vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NR is led by 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella, whose mentor is Marine Le Pen – runner-up in the last two presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France will vote for a new National Assembly on June 30 with a second round scheduled on July 7, two years after Macron failed to clinch an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The euro took a hit as investors fretted that political turmoil could hurt Macron's agenda in in France, which was a key founding member of the eurozone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The prospect of a parliament controlled by Le Pen and Bardella with Macron as president, could thwart Macron's plans for much-needed economic reforms in France that could have eased concerns about... debt," said Brooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those concerns were brought into sharp focus after Standard and Poor's recently downgraded France's long-term sovereign debt rating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Added to the mix, the July election could deliver a far-right prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The likelihood (is) that parliamentary elections in France will result in a PM from another party," said Rabobank analyst Jane Foley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This would change the direction of French politics including the agenda with respect to fiscal policy and potentially for issues such as EU enlargement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increasing popularity of far-right parties has also stoked concerns over rising euroscepticism in the continent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going forward, commentators warn that could further weigh on the euro, which was created in 1999 as a key means of bringing the continent closer together. (AFP)

    Real, Ancelotti backtrack over Club World Cup comments

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlo Ancelotti now says his comment that Real Madrid would not play in Fifa's Club World Cup had been misinterpreted. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756848_1_20240610232625.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said his comments to an Italian daily that Real Madrid would decline Fifa's invitation to participate in the Club World Cup had not been interpreted the way he intended, as the La Liga side reiterated its desire to play in the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti had been quoted by Il Giornale in an interview on Monday as saying that Fifa had undervalued the compensation the 15-times Champions League winners should receive in the revamped tournament with 32 teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fifa can forget it, footballers and clubs will not participate in that tournament," Ancelotti was quoted as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Italian distanced himself from those comments in a social media post on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nothing could be further from my interest than to reject the possibility of playing in a tournament that I consider to be a great opportunity to continue fighting for major titles with Real Madrid," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid said their participation in the tournament was never in question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our club will take part, as planned, in this official competition which we face with pride and with the utmost enthusiasm to once again make our millions of fans all over the world dream of a new title," they said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, one of the most successful football managers in Europe, has won the Club World Cup three times and the Champions League five times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A single Real Madrid match is worth 20 million and Fifa wants to give us that amount for the whole cup. Negative. Like us, other clubs will refuse the invitation," he had been quoted as saying in the interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, who led Real to a Champions League and La Liga double last season, also said there had been a lot of pressure on managers lately but he had managed to stay passionate about his job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I see nothing particularly new, this has always been our job but the case of (former Liverpool manager Juergen) Klopp is significant. The pressure continues, the burden of responsibility becomes too heavy, obsession takes over," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I keep my passion, that's how I live the match, the game, my job; I've always carried this balance with me. I've overcome moments that weren't always positive; after my experience with Everton I was off the radar, they thought I was finished, I was old."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all three European club competitions expanded to 36 teams from next season, the Club World Cup has come under scrutiny for saturating the football calendar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, Fifa said they would not consider rescheduling their 32-team Club World Cup after global players' union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Association (WLA) threatened legal action if they did not review their plans. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Local volunteers say the paramilitary RSF attacked the hospital on Saturday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756849_1_20240610233350.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The main hospital in Sudan's al-Fashir city has been attacked and put out of service, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which supports the facility, said on Sunday, while local volunteers blamed the incident on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city, in the Darfur region of northwestern Sudan, is home to more than 1.8 million residents and displaced people, and is the latest front in a war between the Sudanese army and the RSF which began in April 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF, which has taken over the capital Khartoum and most of western Sudan, is also seeking to advance further within the centre, as United Nations agencies say the people of Sudan are at "imminent risk of famine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 130,000 people have fled their homes in al-Fashir as a result of the fighting in April and May, the United Nations has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF did not respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MSF did not say who had attacked the hospital, the only hospital in al-Fashir capable of handling what it describes as daily mass casualty events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From May 10 to June 6, some 1,315 wounded arrived at the facility and 208 people have died there, but many people are not able to reach the hospital due to the fighting, MSF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel-Olivier Lacharite, head of MSF emergency operations, said the hospital had previously started evacuating patients after being impacted by fighting three times since May 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The al-Fashir Emergency Response Room, a volunteer group, said on Sunday that RSF fighters raided the hospital on Saturday, killing and injuring several people and looting medicine and an ambulance and forcing the hospital to shut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An eyewitness said he saw people evacuating the hospital, and other eyewitnesses said the RSF had launched missiles at the hospital and its vicinity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate attack on Saturday on the Abu Shouk camp to the north of the city impacted another medical centre, injured more than 30, and killed at least two, the camp committee and a volunteer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report last week from The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab said some 40 settlements outside the city have been struck with arson attacks since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local residents have blamed the RSF for the attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leaving the city has proven dangerous, as residents say those fleeing have been attacked and even killed on the main RSF-controlled road out of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of those leaving have taken routes either south to Zamzam camp, or west to the Tawila and Jebel Mara areas, which are controlled by armed groups, including the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army headed by Abdelwahid Mohamed Nour, an aid worker and residents said. (Reuters)

 Three Valencia fans have been handed eight-month prison sentences after pleading guilty to racially insulting Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior in the first conviction for racism-related cases in professional football in Spain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fans won't be allowed to enter football stadiums for two years and will have to pay for all the court proceedings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fans were detained after a Spanish league match between Real Madrid and Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium in May 2023. The match was briefly stopped after Vinícius was insulted.

  Valencia had already banned the fans from the Mestalla. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This is Antony Blinken's eighth visit to the region since war broke out in early October. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756841_1_20240610211844.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Egypt on Monday at the start of another regional tour to push for a much awaited Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken is expected to hold closed-door talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo before heading to Jerusalem later on Monday to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, the first Arab state to recognise Israel and sign a peace treaty with it in 1979, has long mediated between Israeli and Palestinian officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sisi and Blinken are expected to discuss plans to reopen the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, a key conduit for aid into the besieged territory which has been closed for a month since Israeli troops seized its Palestinian side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat's eighth visit to the region since war broke out in early October is intended to gather support for a proposal announced on May 31 by US President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key mediators the US, Egypt and Qatar have been engaged in months of negotiations for a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A one-week truce in November – the only one so far in the Israel-Hamas war – saw some 100 hostages freed, most of them in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the latest proposal, Israel would withdraw from Gaza population centres and Hamas would free hostages as fighting halts for an initial six weeks, with the truce extended as negotiators seek a permanent end to hostilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has not formally responded to the plan, which Biden had described as Israeli, while fears have mounted that domestic Israeli politics could hamper negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While in Israel, Blinken is also expected to meet Benny Gantz, a centrist politician who on Sunday resigned from the war cabinet over Netanyahu's handling of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will then head to Jordan and Qatar for further talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war broke out after the October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,124 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police investigating the death of a man, who was dumped outside of North District Hospital with serious injuries early on Saturday, said they had made an arrest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Detectives said the 32-year-old suspect was picked up in Tin Shui Wai and was believed to be linked to the car used to drop off the victim in Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting senior superintendent Basil Tang, from the New Territories North Crime Regional Headquarters, said officers received a report from a passer-by at around 5.45am on Saturday that the 23-year-old man was lying unconscious near a pedestrian crossing on Po Kin Road, where the hospital is located.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the victim was then brought inside the hospital where he was pronounced dead an hour later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang also said that the deceased had multiple injuries that are thought to have been caused by blunt objects, punches and kicks, adding that his cause of death was still under investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were called to a suspicious vehicle in Wong Chuk Yuen in Pat Heung on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police arrived at the scene to conduct an investigation and believed that this vehicle was involved in the incident. At the time of the incident, someone put on a fake license plate and abandoned the deceased outside of the mentioned hospital," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police and laboratory personnel later searched the car and found blood stains and a stun gun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were treating the case as murder, saying they believe others were involved and remained at large.

    'Catering revenue down by 30pc over Tuen Ng Festival'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Simon Wong, head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, says the local catering sector saw revenues down by 30 percent year on year during the Tuen Ng Festival period. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756819_1_20240610171210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Monday said the holiday weekend had brought little cheer to the industry, with revenues down by about 30 percent compared with last year's Tuen Ng Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slump came despite Immigration Department figures suggesting that fewer Hongkongers travelled to the mainland than those who headed out over Easter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to official figures, some 840,000 Hongkongers headed north over Saturday and Sunday, 10 percent less compared with the number seen in the first two days of the Easter holiday period when over one million residents travelled to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[But]I don't see any positive signs on our revenues,” said Simon Wong, the head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, in an interview with RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His remarks came as official data also showed that more mainland visitors, or some 250,000 people, visited the SAR over Saturday and Sunday, over 40 percent more compared with the 170,000 recorded during the first two days of the Easter holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We do have some activities going on in these couple of days, [especially] some activities in the Tsim Sha Tsui area that would attract more people, including tourists from the mainland and also local residents,” Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But in other districts in Hong Kong, it became quieter - in a way that too many people went over to the harbour area,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the catering veteran noted that sales of “zongzi”, the traditional holiday sticky rice dumplings, were not ideal either, down by about 20 percent compared with previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People are more concerned about [their] health now. In the past, a lot of retail outlets produced their own ‘zongzi’, but in the festival this year, some restaurants did not offer this kind of product. Most of the new [zongzi] products [did not generate] good sales either,” Wong explained, adding that some residents also bought "zongzi" on the mainland instead of Hong Kong due to the cheaper prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to the increasing challenges faced by local restaurants, as more mainland brands expand into the SAR to test the market before going abroad, Wong said that the local catering industry could learn from their mainland peers, including using technology, to ease their difficulties including manpower issues.

 Firefighters on Monday said they found about 40 suspected cat corpses, after extinguishing a fire in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the fire broke out in a tin-sheet house on Kam Shui South Road in Pat Heung at around 11am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firefighters said no one was injured and suspect that an electrical short circuit caused the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they believe stray cats and dogs were being looked after in the premises, and they have notified the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to follow up the case.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Monday warned of further responses if the South kept up its "psychological warfare".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, North Korea has sent hundreds of balloons into the South, carrying trash like cigarette butts and toilet paper, in what it calls retaliation for balloons laden with anti-Pyongyang propaganda floated northwards by activists in the South, which Seoul legally cannot stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean government this month fully suspended a 2018 tension-reducing military deal and restarted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border in response to Pyongyang's balloons, infuriating the North which warned Seoul was creating "a new crisis".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim's influential sister and key government spokeswoman Kim Yo-jong said in a statement released Monday that South Korea would "suffer a bitter embarrassment of picking up waste paper without rest and it will be its daily work".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, she slammed the activists' leaflets as "psychological warfare" and warned that unless Seoul stopped them and called off the loudspeaker broadcasts, the North would hit back. (AFP)

    HK dragon boats make waves in Tuen Ng Festival

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sound of cheering crowds and the rhythmic pounding of drums filled the air at venues across Hong Kong on Monday, as dragon boat races took place to celebrate Tuen Ng Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of paddlers enjoyed the fruits of months of back-breaking training as they took to the waters of Stanley, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sai Kung, Tuen Mun, Aberdeen, and Tai O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sha Tin, the Marine Dragon Boat Team celebrated victory in one of 28 races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere here is very, very exciting. The weather is good too! We’ve dedicated two months to practice. Regardless of whether it's day or night, we all strive together in our practices," said one team paddler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels refreshing to see everyone putting in such effort and working together towards the same goal. It feels great. The atmosphere is exceptional. Everyone is happy, cheering for them together. I will come back to see it again next year," said Sabrina Wang, a tourist watching the races for the very first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some 190 teams competed off Stanley Main Beach in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris from City University said his team had practised for 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard that rain had poured every year here, but the weather is fine today. Synchronisation is the most important factor. Individual strength matters less. The overall strength of a team is the essence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said the HKEX team was full of confidence going into their competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We practised even when the Typhoon Signal No. 3 was issued, during an Amber Rainstorm Warning, and even a Red Rainstorm Warning. Today, we were finally able to get into the water. We are thrilled," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right parties made big strides in elections for the European Parliament, results that rattled the continent's traditional powers and made French President Emanuel Macron call snap legislative elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Millions voted for candidates to serve five-year terms in a new European Parliament, the legislative branch of the 27-member trade bloc made up of 720 seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron’s party suffered a heavy defeat from the far-right National Rally party, while in Germany support for Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats sank to a projected 14 percent, behind the extreme-right Alternative for Germany, which surged into second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saw her position strengthened by her arch-conservative Brothers of Italy group winning the most votes, exit polls showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the gains on the right, exit polls showed a coalition of centre-left and centre-right would remain the majority in parliament, albeit smaller than before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exit poll projected that pro-European centre-right, centre-left, liberal and Green parties would retain a majority of 456 seats, but one which is significantly slimmed down compared to their 488 in the outgoing chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rightwards shift inside the European Parliament may make it tougher to pass new legislation that might be needed to respond to security challenges, the impact of climate change or industrial competition from China and the United States. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of a civil service union on Monday welcomed the administration's plan to facilitate dental services in Greater Bay Area cities so government workers can get faster treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, floated the idea last week, noting a lack of dentists in public clinics in the SAR, while acknowledging authorities need to offer more benefits to retain staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Li Kwai-yin, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants’ Association, said she welcomed the government’s plan, but noted officials should move fast to ramp up dental services as the dentist manpower crunch was rather “severe”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, regarding the dental cleaning service, in the past we had it about once every 12 to 18 months, but now it takes 40 months to receive the next appointment notice to do dental cleaning, and the waiting time for dental treatment services is even longer - it's taking years to receive treatments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For some newly joined civil servants, they didn't even get a chance to do a dental check after waiting for three to four years,” she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also noted that Grade 3A general hospitals in Shenzhen, or the University of Hong Kong–Shenzhen Hospital, could be prioritised to save on travelling time under the plan, and that the scope of the treatments could not only cover dental cleaning, but also other simple treatments, such as tooth filling and tooth extraction procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Private institutions with quality services could be considered as well, Li added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also hopes authorities could further study the feasibility of sharing medical and health records between hospitals in the SAR and the mainland to ease the city's tight dental care services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government last July rolled out a pilot scheme on dental scaling for eligible civil servants to reduce the burden on public healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV programme on Sunday, civil service minister Yeung said there were some technical difficulties with tracking health records and determining the scope of treatments that could be done outside Hong Kong, but noted that authorities need to provide more benefits to maintain the competitiveness of civil service jobs in the face of a broader manpower shortage issue.

    'Ban flavoured shisha to reduce smokers in HK'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tobacco control advocate on Monday said the government should ban flavoured shisha, as part of an overhaul of smoking controls.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry Tong, chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health, made the comment after the administration announced 10 measures last week to quickly reduce smoking, including a ban on flavoured cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, he noted that shisha, or tobacco smoked through a waterpipe, remains legal, but said it should face similar regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shisha is very attractive to young people and women, mainly because there are many flavours and fruity flavours. The law should be clear when it comes to banning flavoured cigarettes. There shouldn't be flavouring agents allowed in shisha," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The implementation of new policies is a step-by-step process, and it is necessary to understand the public's acceptance level. Banning sales and purchases is the first step. I think we can continue to study how to prohibit possession and hopefully that can be implemented soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong also said that banning smoking in queues was a good start given that regulations were easy to define, but a measure to stop "smoking while walking" should be implemented as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Tsui Yuen, a member of the Long-Term Tobacco Policy Concern Group, said he agreed with the extension of smoke-free areas, but suggested the addition of smoking areas as a means of compromise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Non-smoking areas can suppress the problem of second-hand smoking and reduce conflicts between smokers and non-smokers. In addition to adding non-smoking areas, we can also follow Japan and Europe and add some smoking areas or smoking rooms for public use. This can reduce the problem of second-hand smoking, limit littering and help the environment," he said.

 Jrue Holiday had 26 points and 11 rebounds, and Jayson Tatum made up for a rough shooting night with 12 assists and nine rebounds as the Boston Celtics beat the Dallas Mavericks 105-98 on Sunday night to take a 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luka Doncic, who was listed as questionable to play less than two hours before the opening tipoff, scored 32 points with 11 rebounds and 11 assists — the first NBA Finals triple-double in Mavericks franchise history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he missed a one-footed, running floater from 3-point range with 28 seconds left, ending Dallas' last chance at a comeback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 3 is Wednesday night in Dallas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks need a win then or in Game 4 on Friday to avoid a sweep and earn a trip back to the Boston Garden, where the local fans are already making space in the rafters for what would be an unprecedented 18th NBA championship banner. (AP)

    Trump goes on attack in first post-conviction rally

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump speaks to supporters in Las Vegas. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756779_1_20240610101619.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday that he would seek to end taxation of income from tips, a direct appeal to service workers in the swing state of Nevada, which polls suggest is leaning his way ahead of the November 5 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump also once again talked up his supporters convicted for their roles in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, calling them "warriors" and suggesting a possible counter-investigation into the event if he were re-elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pledge on tips, revealed at a sweltering outdoor rally in Las Vegas where temperatures reached 37 degrees Celsius, adds one more detail to a Trump tax plan that has included vague pledges of tax relief to middle-income workers and small businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this is the first time I've said this, and for those hotel workers and people that get tips you're going to be very happy because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips people (are) making," Trump told a crowd of several thousand people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said he would "do that right away, first thing in office," and noted in prepared remarks that he would seek legislation in Congress to make the change. "You do a great job of service, you take care of people and I think it's going to be something that really is deserved."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has previously pledged to make permanent the Republican-passed individual tax cuts that he signed into law in 2017 but which expire at the end of 2025. Tax experts estimate that doing so would raise US deficits by some US$4 trillion over a decade compared to current forecasts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As current law requires, tipped employees must report their tips as income. Eliminating this would add further to deficits without new revenues elsewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's Democratic opponent, President Joe Biden, has pledged to maintain Trump's tax cuts for households earning under US$400,000 a year, but wants to substantially raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and on large corporations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Las Vegas speech was Trump's first large-scale rally since a New York jury found him guilty on May 30 of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election, making him the first former US president convicted of a crime. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull's triple world champion Max Verstappen completed a Canadian Grand Prix hat-trick of victories on a wet, wild and tricky Sunday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Verstappen, who started on the front row alongside Mercedes pole sitter George Russell, stayed clear of trouble on a day of changing conditions, snatching the lead from McLaren's Lando Norris on the final pit stops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman then grimly hung on to claim his sixth victory from nine races this season and the 60th of his Formula One career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another brilliant drive from the 26-year-old who dealt with constantly changing weather, pit stop battles and challenges from McLaren and Mercedes while wrestling with his Red Bull's suspension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Williams's Alex Albon came together, bringing out the safety car for a second time, Verstappen pulled away on the restart and finished 3.879 seconds ahead of Norris while Russell won a nail-biting last-laps duel with team mate Lewis Hamilton to complete the podium.

    Macron shocks France by calling snap elections

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron set off a political earthquake on Sunday when he called shock legislative elections for later this month after he was trounced in the European Union vote by Marine Le Pen's far-right party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Macron's surprise decision represents a major roll of the dice on his political future, three years before his presidency ends. If Le Pen's National Rally (RN) party wins a parliamentary majority, Macron would be left without a say in domestic affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron said the EU results were grim for his government, and one he could not pretend to ignore. In an address to the nation, less than two months before Paris hosts the Olympics, he said lower house elections would be called for June 30, with a second-round vote on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an essential time for clarification," Macron said. "I have heard your message, your concerns and I will not leave them unanswered ... France needs a clear majority to act in serenity and harmony."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by telegenic 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, the RN won about 32 percent of the vote in Sunday's vote, more than double the Macron ticket's 15 percent, according to the first exit polls. The Socialists came within a whisker of Macron, with 14 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen, the frontrunner for the 2027 election in which Macron is unable to stand, welcomed the president's decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are ready to take over power if the French give us their trust in the upcoming national elections," she said at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron's advisers said the president made his decision after this week's 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, when he met people out and about who said they were tired of endless political infighting in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen and Bardella sought to frame the EU election as a mid-term referendum on Macron's mandate, tapping into discontent with immigration, crime and a two-year inflation crisis. (Reuters)

    Centrist Benny Gantz quits Israel's war Cabinet

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Benny Gantz , a centrist member of Israel’s three-man war Cabinet, announced his resignation on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move does not immediately pose a threat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who still controls a majority coalition in parliament. But the Israeli leader becomes more heavily reliant on his far-right allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz said that Netanyahu is making “total victory impossible” and that the government needs to put the return of the hostages seized October 7 by Hamas "above political survival.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The popular former military chief joined Netanyahu’s government shortly after the Hamas attack in a show of unity. His presence also boosted Israel’s credibility with its international partners. Gantz has good working relations with US officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz had previously said he would leave the government by June 8 if Netanyahu did not formulate a new plan for post-war Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He scrapped a planned news conference on Saturday night after four Israeli hostages were dramatically rescued from Gaza earlier in the day in Israel’s largest such operation since the eight-month war began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 274 Palestinians, including children, were killed in the assault, Gaza health officials said. (Reuters)

    Alcaraz beats Zverev in French Open for third Slam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Carlos Alcaraz was made to sweat but clinched his first French Open title by beating Germany's Alexander Zverev 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 in Sunday's final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number three has now won three Grand Slams, after his Wimbledon title last year and his US Open triumph in 2022, and he has a perfect record in major finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old also became the seventh man and the youngest to capture Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz shrugged off an early break and blazed through the first set, which he finished with a big forehand winner, but he allowed Zverev to turn the tide and level the match as his unforced errors crept up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having steadied himself, Alcaraz was serving for the third set at 5-3 before another dip allowed Zverev to take the lead in the contest, but the Spaniard raced through the next set despite a thigh issue and raised his game to prevail in the decider. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool on Sunday said former captain Alan Hansen is seriously ill in hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Premier League club is providing support to the family of the 68-year-old former Scotland international, who retired in 1991 to start a successful career as a television pundit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The thoughts and support of everyone at Liverpool FC are with our legendary former captain Alan Hansen, who is currently seriously ill in hospital,” Liverpool said in a statement on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The club is currently in contact with Alan’s family to provide our support at this difficult time, and our thoughts, wishes and hopes are with Alan and all of the Hansen family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will provide any further updates as we receive them in due course, and we request that the Hansen family’s privacy is respected at this time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hansen joined Liverpool from Scottish team Partick Thistle in 1977. The defender won three European Cups, eight league titles, two FA Cups and three League Cups in 620 appearances for Liverpool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hansen’s former “Match of the Day” colleague Gary Lineker wrote on X: “Horrendous news. Thoughts are with Alan, Janet and all the family.” (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden travelled to a World War I cemetery in France on Sunday in a visit seen as a jab at his predecessor Donald Trump who in 2018 skipped the visit, reportedly calling American war dead "losers."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, an 81-year-old Democrat, is set to face Trump, a 77-year-old Republican, later this year in a presidential election that commentators predict will subject US democracy to a severe test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the last day of his five-day tour, Biden visited the sprawling Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial near the village of Belleau in northern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cemetery contains the graves of 2,289 war dead, most of whom fought in the vicinity and in the Marne Valley in 1918.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the visit, Biden saluted military officers standing beside a floral wreath at the bottom of the steps of a cemetery chapel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He then approached the wreath, touched it, stood silently for a few moments and made the sign of the cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump cancelled his visit to the site in 2018, officially due to poor weather that made helicopter travel risky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Atlantic magazine, citing sources, said Trump refused to visit the cemetery because he did not think it was important and because he was also concerned about his hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers," the magazine quoted Trump as telling his staff members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate conversation, Trump called the marines who perished at Belleau Wood "suckers," the Atlantic reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The billionaire has denied making those remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has repeatedly needled Trump over the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He said they're 'losers' and 'suckers'," Biden said at a recent fundraiser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who in the hell does he think he is? This guy does not deserve to be president," he said in comments released by the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden preferred not to discuss the controversy on Sunday, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked by reporters what message he wanted to send to voters, Biden replied: "Any other question?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been in France since Wednesday and took part in this week's commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those landings in northern France, involving US, British, Canadian and other foreign troops, changed the course of World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Biden on a state visit overshadowed by Ukraine's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he had travelled to France many times but "this has been the most remarkable trip that I've ever made." (AFP)

    Modi sworn in for an historic third term as India's PM

    <![CDATA[<img alt="BJP leader Narendra Modi takes the oath of office for a third time. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756748_1_20240609221641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Narendra Modi was sworn in as India's prime minister on Sunday for a record-equalling third term, but as a restive coalition's head after a shock poll setback that will test his ability to ensure policy certainty in the world's most populous nation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office to Modi at a grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's palace in New Delhi, attended by thousands of dignitaries, including the leaders of seven regional countries, Bollywood stars and industrialists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, who started as a publicist of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is only the second person after independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to serve a third straight term as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, 73, secured the third term in elections that concluded on June 1 with the support of 14 regional parties in his BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), unlike in the previous two terms when his party won an outright majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outcome is seen as a big setback to the popular leader as surveys and exit polls had predicted BJP would secure even more seats than in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi delivered world beating growth and lifted India's global standing but appeared to have missed a step at home as a lack of enough jobs, high prices, low incomes and religious faultlines pushed voters to rein him in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, BJP enjoyed strong majorities, allowing him to govern decisively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's new term as prime minister, therefore, is likely to be fraught with challenges on building consensus on contentious political and policy issues in the face of different interests of regional parties and a stronger opposition, analysts say.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some analysts worry that the fiscal balance in the world's fastest growing economy could also come under pressure due to demands for higher development funds for states ruled by the NDA's regional partners and a possible push by BJP to spend more on welfare to woo back voters it lost in this year's election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, whose election campaign was marked by religious rhetoric and criticism of the opposition for allegedly favouring India's 200 million minority Muslims, has adopted a more conciliatory tone since the shock result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have won the majority ... but to run the country it is unanimity that is crucial ... we will strive for unanimity," he said on Friday after the NDA formally named him coalition head. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's Guardian Council, which oversees elections and legislation, has approved six candidates to run for president in snap elections to be held later this month after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, Iran's State TV reported on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the list are Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Iran's hardline parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards commander, Saeed Jalili, a conservative, who was former chief nuclear negotiator and ran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office for four years and Tehran's conservative mayor Alireza Zakani, according to State TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list, announced on state TV by the Election Office spokesperson, also includes Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist lawmaker, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a hardliner and a former interior minister, and Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi a conservative politician.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the announcement of the final list of candidates, their electoral activities start officially," state TV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election is due to take place on June 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Council had disqualified hardline former president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and former parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, a prominent conservative, state media said. (Reuters)

    Govt urged to limit how much helpers can borrow

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government was on Sunday urged to limit how much domestic helpers are allowed to borrow and to introduce licensing for debt collectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung made the call after being approached for help by around 20 employers, who told him that their helpers had fallen victim to loan traps after filling out online forms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said helpers had to pay back amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently in Hong Kong, [lenders] need to get a licence. However for debt collectors, they do not need to apply for a licence. However, in many places around the world for example in the UK, debt collectors do need a licence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this kind of situation worsens in Hong Kong, I believe that it will force the government to take further steps to set up certain laws to contain this kind of illegal debt collecting. For example, for debt collectors, they need to apply for a certain licence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said one disturbing trend involved debt collectors threatening to publish AI-generated pornographic deepfake photos of employers who refused to pay their helpers' debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted a case of a helper borrowing money from a lender outside Hong Kong and being hit with a demand for more than double the sum just two weeks later.

 The body of British TV presenter and healthy living advocate Michael Mosley has been found on the Greek island of Symi, a deputy mayor on the island said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mosley had been missing for several days. Earlier, a police spokeswoman said that the body of a person believed to be Mosley had been found in the area of Agia Marina on the island, but identification was at that time still pending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mosley, 67, who endorsed fasting and offered tips on sleep and diet, was last seen on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had disappeared after setting out on a stroll in searing temperatures along a rocky coastal path from Agios Nikolaos beach to the village of Pedi. (Reuters)

Online photo." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756715_1_20240609135553.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has said that top officials of a Christian college set up to help students quit drugs have only themselves to blame for its imminent closure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng College announced on Friday that the school on Lantau Island would close on July 7. It comes after four members of staff were arrested in a conspiracy to defraud case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three former board members of the association are on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's new directors said police had frozen HK$4 million in the college's bank accounts, and the government owed HK$3.5 million in project fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to an RTHK enquiry, the government denied owing the cash-strapped college money and said it had provided emergency funding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, as long as the two fugitive former directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association, Jacob Lam and Alman Chan, cooperate and complete the procedures to change bank account signatures, the problem can be solved," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that officials are offering assistance to students affected by Zheng Sheng's closure, including helping to transfer five of them who are currently living in a drug rehabilitation under the college.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, the college's supervisor Choi Hong-sheung criticised the new directors for being influenced by the two former directors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi and three other board members resigned on Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said a government-owned investment vehicle will sign a cooperation deal on Wednesday with a local "tech unicorn" – a start-up company worth more than US$1 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan did not name the company concerned, but said it operated in the artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the tie-up with Hong Kong Investment Corporation will help the business expand research and development investment here, as well as fund training of staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said the deal would help the company roll out the use of its AI models in the Greater Bay Area and speed up digital transformation in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the purpose of the corporation is to help promote innovation and technology in Hong Kong by attracting enterprises and professionals with high potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the number of tech start-ups in the city exceeded 4,250 last year.

 Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky was unbeatable and so were the Florida Panthers as they claimed Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final with a 3-0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers Saturday in Sunrise, Florida.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bobrovsky made 32 saves to record his second shutout of the playoffs. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series will be on Tuesday morning, Hong Kong time, in Florida before switching venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carter Verhaeghe, Evan Rodrigues and Eetu Luostarinen each scored a goal, but the game's biggest story was Bobrovsky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bobrovsky proved from the drop of the puck he was on top of his game and carried it through to the final buzzer en route to claiming his third career playoff shutout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made first-period breakaway stops on Adam Henrique and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, denied Mattias Janmark's golden opportunity in the second period and then blocked Connor McDavid's one-timer of a cross-ice feed early in the third period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Florida's other shutout during this year's playoffs was the opener of the Eastern Conference final series against the New York Rangers, a series the Panthers won in six games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aleksander Barkov collected two assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stuart Skinner stopped 15 shots for the Oilers, who were blanked for the first time in this year's playoff run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Edmonton controlling the play, Verhaeghe opened the scoring with his 10th goal of the playoffs at the 3:59 mark of the first period. Sprung on an odd-man rush, Barkov sent a cross-ice pass that Verhaeghe buried with his team's first shot of the affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodrigues doubled the lead at 2:16 of the second period with another quick-strike goal. Sam Bennett sent the puck deep in the offensive zone and chased it down before sending a pass to the slot that Rodrigues converted for his fourth goal of the postseason run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers continued to push but could not solve Bobrovsky before Luostarinen's empty-net goal with 4.4 seconds remaining sealed the win. It was his second goal of the playoffs. (Reuters)

    Flavoured tobacco ban won't put off visitors: minister

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Sunday said there is no reason to believe that people who use flavoured cigarettes legally at home will be put off visiting Hong Kong by a proposed ban on the products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is among 10 new measures put forward this week to reduce the number of smokers in the SAR, with others including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up if they're in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Lo said he believes visitors won't be dissuaded, noting that tourists still visit Singapore despite its stricter anti-smoking measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People come to Hong Kong not to smoke; they come to Hong Kong for the business opportunities, for our food, for all the tourist attractions. And they love to have a refreshing, lively, healthy city, rather than a city full of smoke and all those cigarette butts on the floor. So I would categorically say that this is not an issue," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also played down concerns raised by newspaper vendors that their businesses would suffer after the ban on flavoured tobacco, which makes up about half of their cigarette sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those newspaper vendors, I understand that this is part of their business, but they have other areas of their business. If some of these people are talking about the illicit cigarettes, I guess these are illegal activities and these vendors should not be performing such business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On outlawing smoking while in a queue, Lo said the concept of queuing is easy to understand since most Hongkongers have been taught how to line up since kindergarten. He added that the definition of a queue will be made clearer during the law-making process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health chief also said it's unprecedented that the government raised the tobacco tax for two consecutive years, adding that the authorities will explore whether there is room for a further increase next year.

    Right tipped to triumph in European election

<div class="itemFullText">
 Voters in 21 EU countries including France and Germany will conclude a four-day election for the European Parliament on Sunday, which is expected to shift the assembly to the right and boost the numbers of eurosceptic nationalists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The election will shape how the European Union, a bloc of 450 million citizens, confronts challenges including a hostile Russia, increased industrial rivalry, climate change and immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election began on Thursday in the Netherlands and in other countries on Friday and Saturday, but the bulk of EU votes will be cast on Sunday, with France, Germany, Poland and Spain opening the polls and Italy holding a second day of voting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls predict the pro-European liberals and Greens will lose seats, reducing the majority of the centre-right and centre-left and complicating efforts to push through new EU laws or increase European integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many voters have been hit by the cost of living crisis, have concerns about migration and the cost of the green transition and are disturbed by rising geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard and far-right parties have seized on this disquiet and offered the electorate an alternative to the mainstream.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Greens, facing a backlash from hard-pressed households, farmers and industry over costly EU policies limiting CO2 emissions, look set to be among the big losers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasts for the liberal group Renew Europe are also grim, given the expectation that Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National will trounce French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Renaissance in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, exit polls from Thursday already showed nationalist Geert Wilders' anti-immigration party was set to win seven of the 29 Dutch seats in the EU assembly, from zero in 2019, following up on his large win in last year's national election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Belgium, voters will also get to elect federal and regional chambers and are forecast to back the far-right Flemish separatist party Vlaams Belang in record numbers, although it could still be kept from office by other parties. (Reuters)

    North Korea sends more trash-filled balloons south

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea has resumed sending balloons carrying trash over the border to South Korea, officials and news reports said on Sunday, a week after it vowed to continue if anti-North Korea leaflets are flown from the South.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of balloons with trash attached have been found in Seoul and in areas near the border overnight and early on Sunday, after the South Korean military said late on Saturday the North was again launching them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's military said on Sunday it takes the balloons "very seriously" and was on alert to take action in response as necessary. It did not elaborate what actions it would take.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea has warned it would take "unendurable" measures against the North for sending the trash balloons, which could include blaring propaganda broadcasts from huge loudspeakers set up at the border directed at the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean government has said the balloons were sent in retaliation to anti-North leaflets flown by South Korean activists as part of a propaganda campaign and launched hundreds of them starting late in May carrying trash and manure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On June 2, it said it would temporarily halt sending the balloons because 15 tons of trash it sent was probably enough to get the message across how "unpleasant" it was. However, it vowed to resume if leaflets are again flown from the South by sending hundred times the amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A group of South Korean activists defied the warning and have since flown more balloons to the North with leaflets criticising its leader Kim Jong Un together with USB sticks containing K-pop videos and dramas, and US dollar notes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has shown some of the angriest reaction towards the leaflet campaign and the loudspeaker broadcasts, in some cases firing weapons at the balloons and the speakers in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts have said the reaction was an indication Pyongyang considers the propaganda as a serious threat to controlling its public. (Reuters)

    China team gears up for Paris Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's sports officials say the national team's performance during the coming Olympics will be "worth looking forward to," although they are faced with more challenges than previous games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The General Administration of Sport of China said it expects athletes to compete in around 210 out of the 329 events at the Paris Olympics next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the national team would take part in all events in diving, weightlifting, shooting, gymnastics, table tennis and badminton – sports that the country is traditionally strong at.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Lingfeng, who heads the training division of the competitive sports department of the body, said the team was making its final preparations for Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the time difference and other factors would not be favourable for the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are perfectly aware that the difficulties and challenges at the Paris Olympics are far greater than those before," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The level of our athletic skills in some gold-winning events has dropped as we're transitioning from one generation of athletes to another."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang noted the United States, which has topped the gold medal table at world tournaments in the past, continues to be one of the main competitors, while other countries are also improving quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the official said the national team has what it takes to achieve "outstanding results" in the French capital after preparing for the games for more than two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they have also been working to instil patriotism into athletes and coaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been educating the national team... to further solidify their confidence and determination to attain good results at the Paris Olympics and bring glory to the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said doing well at the Olympics is important to turn China into a country that excels at sports.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 George Russell put Mercedes on pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix on Saturday after setting exactly the same time as Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Triple Formula One world champion Verstappen missed out on the pole because he set his time of one minute 12.000 seconds after his British rival in a drama-filled qualifying session at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mercedes signalled that they were going to be a threat for pole earlier on Saturday when Lewis Hamilton, a seven-times winner in Canada, posted the top time in final practice with Russell close behind in third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain, which had disrupted both practices on Friday, returned for the first two phases of qualifying but the skies cleared and the sun began to appear just in time for the last-10 shootout that ended in a dead heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell will start on pole on Sunday for the first time since Brazil 2022, joined on the front row by Verstappen who is chasing a Canadian Grand Prix hat-trick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second row will be all McLaren with Lando Norris, a winner in Miami, starting third ahead of team mate Oscar Piastri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the tightest qualifying battles ever in Formula One, the top seven cars were split by less than three-tenths of a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RB's Daniel Ricciardo was a surprise fifth fastest, with Aston Martin's Spanish double world champion Fernando Alonso sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven-times world champion Hamilton, who claimed the first of his 103 grand prix wins in Montreal in 2007, could not quite match his Mercedes team mate's pace and will start seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Ferrari made the top 10, with Charles Leclerc 11th fastest and Carlos Sainz 12th. (Reuters)

    Bodies of 11 migrants found off coast of Libya

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An aid group said on Saturday it recovered the bodies of 11 migrants off the Libyan coast and transferred them to an Italian coast guard ship off Lampedusa island, where thousands are trying to reach from North Africa.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aid group, Doctors Without Borders, said its Geo Barents rescue ship had recovered the bodies following a search operation that lasted more than nine hours, after being alerted by German humanitarian organisation Sea-Watch, which also rescues migrants at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German group said it was unclear whether the migrants were victims of a previous shipwreck, adding they had tried to contact Libya’s coast guard to recover the bodies but received no reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Saturday’s mission, the Sea-Watch crew also discovered another body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As we cannot determine the reason behind this tragedy, we know that people will continue to take dangerous routes in a desperate attempt to reach safety, and Europe must find safe and legal pathways for them,” Doctors Without Borders, also known as MSF, wrote in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MSF vessel was ordered to transport the other 165 people onboard, who were rescued during its Mediterranean operations, to the northern port of Genoa. The group complained that the decision would significantly delay assistance to migrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of migrants leaving from North African countries try to reach Europe using Libya as a departing point, as they brave a dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to escape war and poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central Mediterranean route remains the world’s most dangerous crossing. In 2023, more than 3,000 people went missing on this route, according to the International Organisation for Migration. (AP)

    Wigan win Challenge Cup at emotional Wembley

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The sport of rugby league used the Challenge Cup final to pay tribute to legend Rob Burrow. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756674_1_20240609023919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wigan Warriors beat Warrington Wolves 18-8 to secure a record-extending 21st Challenge Cup on Saturday as rugby league paid tribute to the late Rob Burrow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former Leeds Rhinos star Burrow, 41, died last week after a battle with motor neurone disease, leading to an outpouring of emotion across Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burrow's shirt number 7 was projected onto giant screens inside and outside Wembley and as a further tribute, the men's final kicked off at 3:07 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the action started, reigning Super League Man of Steel Bevan French set up Zach Eckersley for Wigan's opening try and stretched over for the second himself to ensure his side also became the first team since 2007 to hold all four of the game's major honours at once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warrington rallied and Matt Dufty's late try gave them a glimmer of hope but they were second best throughout and seldom looked likely to win the trophy for head coach Sam Burgess in his first season in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burrow's name and image adorned a large banner near Wembley and fans laid scarves and flowers at a rugby league statue outside the stadium in tribute to the former Leeds number seven, who won two Challenge Cup finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd of nearly 65,000 rose for a minute's silence before kick-off and again seven minutes into the match in honour of the shirt Burrow wore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigan scored their opening try in the 19th minute when French delivered the ball into the path of Eckersley, who shrugged off Matty Ashton to touch down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ashton's knock-on three minutes later from Harry Smith's high ball kept Warrington pinned back and led to Wigan's second try, Abbas Miski and Jai Field stretching the opposition defence before French touched down following a scrum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liam Farrell marked his fifth final by scoring Wigan's third try and Smith's third conversion gave Matt Peet's men an 18-2 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warrington gave themselves a glimmer of hope with 15 minutes remaining when Dufty arrowed in from the left, Josh Thewlis's conversion reducing the arrears to 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Wigan saw out the final moments with the minimum of fuss to take the trophy for the second time in three years and add it to the Grand Final, League Leaders' Shield and World Club Challenge trophies they already own. (AFP)

 Rescuers continued searching for British TV presenter Michael Mosley on the mountainous Greek island of Symi on Saturday, the third day of a wide operation launched after he was reported missing by his wife.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 67-year-old doctor and healthy living advocate, who has endorsed fasting and offered tips on sleep and diet, was last seen at 1:30 pm (1030 GMT) on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He disappeared after he set out on a stroll in searing temperatures along a rocky coastal path from Agios Nikolaos beach to the village of Pedi. Mosley did not have his mobile phone with him, hampering tracing efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police, the fire brigade, the coast guard and volunteers have been searching on and off the island in the eastern Aegean assisted by a helicopter, drones and rescue dogs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, police searches shifted focus to another rocky area, between Pedi and the beach of Agia Marina, after video footage showed Mosley walking through the village of Pedi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The search continues," said spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou. "We are investigating on foot another rocky part, the wider area of Agia Marina."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers were also involved in the operation and vessels sailing nearby were on alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images from a security camera in Pedi showed what is believed to be Mosley, strolling by at 1:49 pm on Wednesday, holding a sun umbrella, suggesting he may have made it safely off the coastal path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Symi Mayor Lefteris Papakalodoukas said that the images and video footage from security cameras had helped sketch out what authorities believed was Mosley's possible route, which he described as "unconventional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They indicated that he may have continued further through Pedi into another challenging area around Agia Marina, the mayor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mosley has appeared on well-known UK TV programmes including Trust Me, I'm a Doctor, The One Show and This Morning. (Reuters)

    CUHK showcases mobile app to diagnose depression

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mobile app developed by the Chinese University has proved to be effective in diagnosing symptoms of depression, and researchers hope the invention can increase people's willingness to seek help at an early stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using artificial intelligence, the app evaluates users' mental status by analysing attributes such as facial expression, voice and language.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A study was conducted between June 2021 and March 2023 to verify the tool's effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 180 participants who took part regularly used the app to rate their mood state, and record videos of themselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers noted that compared to healthy individuals, those suffering from depression tended to frown more and smile less. They also paused more often in their speech and used more negative emotion words.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants also wore devices which measured their rest activity. Data suggested depression patients were less active and suffered from sleep problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The self-assessment can be performed at home, without the need for face-to-face clinical consultations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers hope this will make the tool more palatable to potential patients.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iga Swiatek won her third consecutive French Open championship and fourth in five years by defeating Jasmine Paolini 6-2, 6-1 in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Swiatek trailed 2-1 early in Court Philippe Chatrier before taking the next 10 games to claim the opening set and go up 5-0 in the second. She stretched her winning streak at Roland Garros to 21 matches and her career record at the place is now 35-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old from Poland is the first woman with three trophies in a row in Paris since Justine Henin from 2005 to 2007.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek also won the French Open in 2020 and the US Open in 2022 and is now 5-0 in major finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12th-seeded Paolini , a 28-year-old from Italy, was appearing in a Slam final for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had never been past the second round at one of the four most important tennis tournaments until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini will play in the French Open women’s doubles final on Sunday with partner Sara Errani against 2023 US Open singles champion Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova. (AP)

    Emmanuel Macron hosts Joe Biden for a state visit

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit on Saturday as the two allies aim to show off their partnership on global security issues and move past trade tensions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defence, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Élysées leading to the Élysée Palace, where the two held official meetings and were delivering public statements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Proud to be here," Biden said at the Arc de Triomphe. "A great honour.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the Covid-19 pandemic receded. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli forces rescued four hostages alive from two locations in the central Gaza area of al-Nuseirat on Saturday, the military said, eight months after they were kidnapped by Hamas-led militants in a deadly incursion into Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The four hostages, three males and one female who were abducted from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on October 7 last year, were taken to hospital for medical checks, the military said, and were in good health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were identified as Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After eight months of devastating war in Gaza triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack, 116 of the approximately 250 hostages abducted by militants are left in the Palestinian enclave, according to Israeli tallies – at least 40 of whom have been declared dead in absentia by authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's chief military spokesman said the rescue operation was held under fire in the heart of a residential neighbourhood, where he said Hamas had been concealing hostages among Gaza civilians under the armed guard of militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a televised news conference, spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said one Israeli soldier had been badly injured. Israeli forces returned fire, including with airstrikes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza health ministry said more than 200 Palestinians were killed and about 400 wounded in the Israeli operation. It did not say how many of the fatalities were combatants but said that women and children were among the dead. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Danish police said on Saturday a 39-year-old man would appear in front of a judge for preliminary questioning in relation to an assault on the country's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in central Copenhagen late on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Frederiksen, leader of Denmark's Social Democratic Party and prime minister since 2019, was shocked after being beaten by a man at Kultorvet square in Copenhagen on Friday, her office said in a statement on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister was able to walk away and had no outward signs of harm after the assault, Soren Kjergaard, who works as a barista in central Copenhagen, told Reuters after seeing her being escorted away by security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the man would be brought before the Copenhagen City Court for questioning at around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), but declined to provide more detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither the police nor the prime minister's office said anything about the man's motive or whether he had carried a weapon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault comes two days before Danes head to the polls in the European Union election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A month ago, three German politicians suffered assaults ahead of European Parliament and district council elections and more attacks followed earlier this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several EU leaders condemned the incident, which happened just three weeks after Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico was seriously injured in an assassination attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attack on Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is an intolerable act of violence that represents an attack on the heart of democratic values," Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president said on X:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so shocked at the news of you being assaulted tonight. I condemn this despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe. I wish you strength and courage - I know you have plenty of both." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspected organised crime boss in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro was killed on Friday in a shoot-out with police as they tried to arrest him, local authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rio's civil police said in a statement that Rui Paulo Goncalves Estevao, also known as Pipito, was the alleged head of an organized criminal group accused of extortion and sowing terror in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When he was approached, he attacked the agents and a confrontation ensued. The criminal was hit and taken to a local hospital, but died of his wounds," police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rio Governor Claudio Castro said police had dealt a "hard blow against criminals who disturb the peace of the population".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Castro wrote on social media site X that Pipito earlier "gave the order to burn 35 buses" in western Rio neighbourhoods in retaliation for the death of a relative of another alleged crime boss, who is in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rio's organised crime groups, known as militias, were founded about four decades ago by former law enforcement officers and originally presented as self-defence organizations to fight against violent drug traffickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In reality, they function as mafias that control various businesses through extortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militias have also seized public land to illegally build housing or commercial buildings, with real estate becoming a key source of revenue. (AFP)

    Authorities to offer help to Zheng Sheng students

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Saturday said authorities will offer assistance to students and staff affected by the closure of Christian Zheng Sheng College, including helping them find new schools or jobs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school, which helps teenagers fight drug addiction, has announced that it will cease operating in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others, including the institution’s head, Alman Chan, were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has issued a statement on Friday, saying it wasn't notified about the closure. It blamed those wanted by the police for the school's financial problems, saying they were trying to avoid responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Choi said about 10 students and eight teachers would be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're working with different departments, and the associated school to help the students. If some students want to keep studying, we'll help them find the right programmes. And since students are at different ages, some might want to start working. We'll talk to them about that too. For the teachers, we'll help them with their pay. We'll work with other departments to make sure everything is taken care of,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted the HK$1.8 million that had been earlier allocated to the school through the About Beat Drugs Fund would also be used to help cover the school's daily expenses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the education minister also said that the bureau is starting discussions with the parties involved in the recent dispute over the appointment of interim vice-presidents at the University of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU president Zhang Xiang has accused the university council of bypassing him over the decision. Some former council members of the university also issued a letter to the Chief Executive John Lee, saying they have lost faith in the council's chairperson Priscilla Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that it's common for a large organisation like a university to have different opinions, saying it's important for everyone involved to share their thoughts openly. She said she’s confident that a decision will be made soon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said safeguarding national security is fundamental for a strong and stable Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Lee said national security loopholes were addressed after Basic Law Article 23 legislation took effect in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From the anti-national education movement in 2012, Occupy Central in 2014, the Mong Kok unrest in 2016, to the 2019 social unrest and the Hong Kong version of a 'colour revolution', they used large-scale riots to create unrest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to the central government, decisive action was taken to implement the National Security Law in Hong Kong. It addressed the legal vacuum surrounding national security, it improved the electoral system, and implemented the principle of patriots governing Hong Kong. The city has finally returned to normality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said some countries had attempted to ruin Hong Kong's unique role in the nation's development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History tells us that we cannot afford to disregard national security risks. Indeed, security and development have a symbiotic relationship: one cannot exist without the other, and one will benefit the other. This is sheer logic and common sense," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our national security law based on the principles of the rule of law provides high-standard security to guarantee and safeguard the better and sustainable development of Hong Kong in the long run."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-day forum is taking place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.

    NSL demonstrates HK's constitutional duty: Zheng

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said the National Security Law has helped Hong Kong to curb disorder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Zheng Yanxiong said a dual legislation and dual enforcement mechanism between the SAR and the mainland was established after the National Security Law was implemented in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It demonstrates the SAR's constitutional duty. It shows that Hong Kong's mechanisms for safeguarding national security and enforcement have improved, while addressing previous shortcomings - and ensuring that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle is on the right track," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that 45 out of 47 defendants were convicted in a subversion case after they were involved in an unofficial legislative primary election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different sectors generally affirmed the ruling, believed that it disseminated correct messages on the rule of law, showed the determination and confidence of the society in safeguarding national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nong Rong, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the National Security Law had been effective in improving governance and creating prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past four years, Hong Kong has made a significant transformation from chaos to governance, returning to the track of development. In March, Hong Kong completed legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, further solidifying the legal shield for safeguarding national security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong National Security Law explicitly identifies its purpose as maintaining the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong SAR, highlighting this original aspiration to protect development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government Dong Jingwei said the central government has full trust in the SAR government, authorising it to have the responsibility for safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the central government would deal with any problems that the SAR government finds difficult to handle.

    HK-born US astronaut Anders dies in plane crash

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ninety-year-old Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down north of Seattle.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-born retired US astronaut William Anders, who was one of the first three humans to orbit the moon, capturing the famed "Earthrise" photo during Nasa's Apollo 8 mission in 1968, died on Friday in the crash of a small aeroplane in Washington state. He was 90.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NASA chief Bill Nelson paid tribute to Anders on social media with a post of the iconic image of Earth rising over the lunar horizon, saying the former Air Force pilot "offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Heritage Flight Museum near Burlington, Washington, which he co-founded, confirmed that Anders was killed in an aircraft accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down off the coast of Jones Island, part of the San Juan Islands archipelago north of Seattle, between Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, The Seattle Times reported, citing his son, Greg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to television station KCPQ-TV, a Fox affiliate in Tacoma, Anders, a resident of San Juan County, was at the controls of a vintage Air Force single-engine T-34 Mentor that he owned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed on KCPQ showed a plane plunging from the skies in a steep dive before slamming into the water just offshore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US Naval Academy graduate and Air Force pilot, Anders joined Nasa in 1963 as a member of the third group of astronauts. He did not go into space until December 21, 1968, when Apollo 8 lifted off on the first crewed mission to leave Earth orbit and travel 240,000 miles (386,000 km) to the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was the "rookie" on the crew, alongside Frank Borman, the mission commander, and James Lovell, who had flown with Borman on Gemini 7 in 1965 and later commanded the ill-fated Apollo 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apollo 8, originally scheduled for 1969, was pushed forward because of concerns the Russians were accelerating their own plans for a trip around the moon by the end of 1968. That gave the crew only several months to train for the historic but highly risky mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carried by a Saturn V rocket never before used on a crewed flight and tested only twice, the spacecraft faced the delicate and daunting task of entering and leaving lunar orbit safely. Failure meant crashing into the moon or being forever stranded in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recalling the mission 40 years later, Anders acknowledged that although confident of success, he thought "there was a one-third chance" the crew "didn't come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trepidation turned to triumph when Apollo 8 reached the moon on Christmas Eve and during its 10 orbits captivated a worldwide television audience of more than a billion people by transmitting the first pictures of the lunar surface just miles below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key part of the mission was photographing the moon, but "after about the third revolution, the moon was clearly kind of a boring place. There was nothing but holes and holes upon holes," Anders said at a symposium in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts' focus shifted abruptly when the Earth began rising over the lunar surface. "Me, Lovell and Borman suddenly said at once: 'Look at that' - this gorgeous, colourful, beautiful planet of ours coming up over the ugly lunar horizon," Anders told Forbes magazine in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a long lens and colour film, Anders ended up snapping the photograph now known as "Earthrise." The image, vividly capturing both the Earth's beauty and fragility in the vastness of space, is considered one of history's most influential photographs, widely credited with helping inspire the environmental movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here we came all the way to the moon to discover Earth," Anders later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also played a key role in another indelible episode from that Christmas Eve mission - leading off as the crew read from the Book of Genesis while Apollo 8 transmitted images of the lunar surface to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three astronauts were greeted as national heroes when they splashed down three days later in the Pacific Ocean and were feted as Time magazine's "Men of the Year." (Reuters)

    CS secretary says room for political life in new code

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Civil Services Ingrid Yeung on Saturday said the new set of rules that government workers must follow wouldn’t restrict them from having a personal political life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The updated Civil Service Code set out 12 core values public servants must follow, including being professional and staying neutral when it comes to politics. It also asked them to not publicly criticise government policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Yeung said civil servants can still take part in social activities or public campaigns during their private time, but they need to be careful about being perceived to represent a government standpoint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have set out very clearly in the code that civil servants can also have their political life. They can join social activities, except where we have strict rules about not being able to join.  But the principle is when they join social activities, they have to ensure that their participation in these social activities will not cause a conflict of interest with their jobs,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And also their joining would not allow people or attract people to believe that they are representing the government's position, the activities they join have government backing or allow people to think that they are actually representing a larger group of civil servants’ views.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted higher rank civil servants, or those taking leadership roles, should be even more cautious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's difficult to draw a solid line below which [rank] you can be very care-free about what you speak and about which you have to be really very cautious. As you move up, I think civil servants will have to really take care,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Yeung was also asked whether the proposed 3 percent pay rise for all civil servants this year, a move that faced strong opposition from unions, would affect morale. The level of increase is significantly lower than the rises of up to 5.47 percent suggested by a pay trend survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that civil servants will be able to understand that there are constraints on what the government can do this year especially given our very tight financial situation and also I think as we progress with our various initiatives to improve livelihood and to improve the economy, there will be recognition of the public on what civil servants have done and this is also something that will be able to boost morale,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that the final decision would be made by the Executive Council, but noted that the room for adjustment is limited.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alice Mak says the SAR will host a youth development summit in the summer with at least 1,000 participants expected.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Young people have become increasingly enthusiastic in visiting the mainland and experiencing the country's development, according to the home and youth affairs chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alice Mak said the number of applications for a cross-border internship programme this year doubled that from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Your Home Address programme broadcast on Saturday, the secretary for home and youth affairs also said Hong Kong is set to host a youth development summit this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will set up a platform for our young people to exchange views and learn from other young people from other countries and areas. We will invite the participation of guest speakers and youth groups from the mainland and overseas, so that Hong Kong's young people can exchange views and learn from their counterparts in other countries," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that there are no fewer than 1,000 participants for the summit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other initiatives targeting young people that have been introduced include a programme for government-backed hostels and an alliance supporting young Hong Kong entrepreneurs in the Greater Bay Area, the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's community work, Mak said she's grateful for the efforts by more than 450 care teams across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now nearly 5,000 volunteers serving in the care teams. They are willing to contribute to the community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a year's time, we have already visited 90,000 households in the community, and we have provided several thousand services for the residents. These are the achievements that we have made only in a year's time. And I believe, and I trust that, as time goes by, we will enhance our service and we can achieve even more in the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said people volunteering in the care teams not only respond to emergencies such as the recent deadly blaze in Jordan, but also provide services to those in need such as the elderly.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Olympic Games less than two months away, dedicated Hong Kong-trained specialists are working tirelessly to ensure the country's elite athletes stay injury-free and perform at their very best in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For trainer Ivy Lui, a career highlight came when Liu Yang, one of the Chinese gymnasts she worked with, secured the gold medal on rings at last year’s World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I felt like my dreams from graduation have come true,” she said. “I knew I wanted to help an athlete achieve an honour at the international stage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gymnast also won gold in rings at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so he'll be defending his title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui's journey as a sports therapist began eight years ago when she graduated from the Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, a member institution of the Vocational Training Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending time with the Hong Kong Rugby Union, she began working with the gymnastics team in Guangzhou before joining the national gymnastics team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her days involve giving massages to the gymnasts, to help them relax after training sessions, and treating any injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her work goes beyond physical therapy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To ensure comprehensive preparation, we also recreate a live atmosphere and simulate actual playing time during our gym training sessions in China before going overseas,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dedicated professional Davii Wang, a rugby technician, holds a master's degree in sports science and physical education from the Chinese University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang was already working with the national rugby team before he went on to pursue an advanced degree in Hong Kong, so he would have a deeper understanding of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The one-year study made my work more systematic,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we use force platforms to test athletes, which can indicate whether there’s discrepancy in their leg strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there is a big discrepancy, we will strengthen the weaker leg to prevent injuries.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of Wang's key tasks is to make sure China's men and women rugby teams stay in top form, as they try to book a ticket to Paris through a qualification tournament later this month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was on Friday "hit" by a man on a Copenhagen square, her office said, with EU chiefs quickly condemning the attack.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Danish prime minister's office said in a statement that Frederiksen was "shocked by the incident," but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was hit by a man Friday evening on Kultorvet in Copenhagen. The man was subsequently arrested," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes on the heels of a spate of attacks on politicians from across the political spectrum at work or on the campaign trail in Germany ahead of this week's EU elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 15, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot four times at close range as he greeted supporters after a government meeting in the central town of Handlova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fico, who survived the assassination attempt, was taken to a hospital in a nearby city after the shooting, where he underwent two lengthy surgeries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU chief Charles Michel and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola on Friday slammed the attack on Frederiksen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Metsola urged the Danish head of government to "keep strong," while adding in a post to X that "violence has no place in politics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel in turn said he was "outraged by the assault."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I strongly condemn this cowardly act of aggression," the European Council president said in a separate post to X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copenhagen police confirmed that an incident involving the prime minister had occurred but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have one person arrested in the case, which we are now investigating. At this time, we have no further comments or remarks on the case," police said in a statement on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I must say that it shakes all of us who are close to her," Danish Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said in a post to social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Something like this must not happen in our beautiful, safe and free country," he said. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks ended slightly lower on Friday in choppy trading after stronger-than-expected US jobs data pointed to a robust economy but prompted worries the Federal Reserve may wait longer to cut interest rates than many investors had hoped.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy generated about 272,000 jobs in May, far more than the 185,000 analysts had forecast, according to a Labour Department report. The unemployment rate inched up to 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The benchmark S&P 500 slipped immediately after the report while US Treasury yields climbed as traders slashed bets on a September rate reduction. The index recovered and briefly hit a fresh intraday record high as investors noted the data pointed to underlying economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It finished slightly lower, with the utilities, materials, and communication services stocks among the biggest drag. Financials and technology advanced ahead of others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 percent, the Nasdaq rose 2.38 percent, and the Dow added 0.29 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This tells you there's certainly not going to a cut in the short term, and with the bond yields going back up it's putting a lot of pressure on the risk-on trade, which is probably small caps," said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's just a function of interest rates and maybe a little higher for longer, and people have to recalibrate for that type of environment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a 56 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Investors will eye US inflation data next week and the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which ends on June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one expects the Fed to cut (rates next week), but will they open the door for a cut as soon as September is the big question on everyone's mind," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, adding he still sees a September reduction on the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.22 percent, to 38,798, the S&P 500 lost 0.11 percent, to 5,346 and the Nasdaq lost 0.23 percent, to 17,133.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop slumped 39 percent in volatile trading just as stock influencer "Roaring Kitty" kicked off his first livestream in three years. The gaming retailer had announced a potential stock offering and a drop in quarterly sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other so-called meme stocks, including AMC Entertainment and Koss Corp, fell 15.1 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia slipped, on track to extend the previous session's losses, with its valuation again dipping below the US$3 trillion mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lyft shares rose 0.6 percent, following a forecast of 15 percent annual growth in its gross bookings through 2027 after markets closed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 1,177 stocks rose and 3,064 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.6-to-1 ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 149 new lows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total volume of shares traded across US exchanges was about 10.75 billion, compared with the 12.7 billion average over the last 20 trading days. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz triumphs over Jannik Sinner in a four-hour, five-setter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz started poorly and fell behind early in his French Open semi-final against Jannik Sinner. Later, as both dealt with cramps under Friday's afternoon sun, Alcaraz trailed by two sets to one.
 <br>
  <br/>
  By the end of the latest instalment in this burgeoning rivalry between two young, talented players, an engaging five-setter that lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes, Alcaraz actually had accumulated fewer total points, 147-145.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That, of course, is not the score that matters. And Alcaraz, who says he takes pleasure from challenges, ultimately persevered, pulling out a 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Sinner to get to his first final in Paris. It made the 21-year-old from Spain the youngest man to reach a Grand Slam title match on three surfaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to find the joy (while) suffering. That’s the key – even more on clay, here at Roland Garros. Long rallies. Four-hour matches. Five sets,” Alcaraz said. “You have to fight. You have to suffer. But as I told my team many, many times, you have to enjoy suffering.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won championships at the US Open in 2022 on hard courts and at Wimbledon in 2023 on grass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the No 3-seeded Alcaraz will face No 4 Alexander Zverev of Germany on the red clay on Sunday. Hours before his 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 semi-final victory over No 7 Casper Ruud of Norway, Zverev’s domestic abuse case in Berlin ended, because he reached an out-of-court settlement with his accuser, a former girlfriend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruud started well, but then began to fade, and he was handed some pills by a doctor during a third-set changeover. Ruud looked listless and stopped chasing some shots, a shell of the player who leads the tour in match wins this season and has been the runner-up at majors three times – including in 2022 and 2023 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev finally broke through at Roland Garros after bowing out in the semi-finals each of the past three years. This will be his second Grand Slam final: He blew a two-set lead and lost in five against Dominic Thiem at the US Open in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the first French Open men’s final without Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer since 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic was the defending champion in Paris, but he withdrew before the quarter-finals after tearing the meniscus in his right knee and had surgery this week. Because he failed to get back to the final, he will drop from atop the ATP rankings, allowing Sinner to rise a spot from No 2, despite his defeat on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously disappointed how it ended, but it’s part of my growing and the process,” said Sinner, who won the Australian Open in January for his first major trophy. “The winner is happy, and then the loser tries to find a way to beat him the next time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Italian showed up in Paris with a lingering hip injury that forced him to sit out the clay-court tournament in Rome last month. Alcaraz missed that event, too, because of a right forearm issue that he said made him afraid to hit his booming forehands at full force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both men experienced physical problems in the third set. Alcaraz's right hand began to cramp. Sinner had his right forearm and left thigh massaged by a trainer during changeovers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It brought to mind last year’s French Open semifinals, when Alcaraz got off to a terrific start against Djokovic but then dealt with full-body cramps that rendered the remainder of the match anti-climactic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I learned from last year’s match against Djokovic, when I was in the same position as today,” Alcaraz said. “I know that, in this moment, you have to be calm, you have to keep going, because the cramp is going to go away. You have to stay there, fighting.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and Sinner are seen as the future of men’s tennis. The present isn’t too shabby, either. Even though this was not necessarily the most aesthetically pleasing of their nine head-to-head meetings – Alcaraz leads 5-4 – and they combined for 102 unforced errors, there were moments of brilliance that generated duelling clap-accompanied chants of each man’s first name from the Court Philippe Chatrier crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fifth set, with shadows covering more than half the court, Alcaraz moved out front by sliding until he could reach across his body to snap a backhand passing winner for a break point. A forehand winner – one of his 30 in the match – made it 2-0 at the 3½-hour mark, earning a yell of “Vamos!” from his coach, 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon, it was 3-0, and Alcaraz was on his way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was a great match. For sure, the sets he won, he played better in the important points,” Sinner said. “That was the key.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both players walloped the ball with such force that the ball-off-strings thuds elicited gasps from spectators in the middle of points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner, his rust-colored shirt a few shades darker than the clay, came out ready at the start of the match, barely ever missing, gliding more than grinding along the baseline, stretching his long limbs to get to nearly everything Alcaraz offered. Alcaraz, his right arm covered by a white sleeve, would deliver a powerful shot to a corner, punctuated with a grunt, and Sinner would somehow get to it, flip it back and draw a mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner led 4-0 and it took Alcaraz 20 minutes of striving to simply place a “1” beside his name on the scoreboard. The second set began inauspiciously for Alcaraz, who fell behind 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I told myself,” Alcaraz said, “that it’s going to be a long match.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not go quietly. Getting more aggressive and doing what he could to shorten points, Alcaraz turned things around right when he needed to, using a five-game run to take control of that set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Sinner took the third, Alcaraz pushed the proceedings to a fifth. He closed the fourth with a cross-court backhand winner, then raised his right fist and shook it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's how Alcaraz came through: He came up with a 32-23 edge in winners over the last two sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his strokes, somehow, gaining zest, and the fans, somehow, getting louder, Alcaraz advanced at a tournament he grew up watching on TV at home in Spain as his countryman Nadal piled up a record 14 titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not that it was easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s one of the toughest matches that I’ve played, for sure,” Alcaraz said. “The toughest matches that I played in my short career have been against Jannik.” (AP)
