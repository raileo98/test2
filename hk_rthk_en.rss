<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year’s book fair said on Tuesday that they hope to attract visitors from around the world by showcasing props and manuscripts from popular Hong Kong movies and dramas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fair's theme this time will be film and television literature and the event will feature AI-generated movie images, as well as talks by the author of a book on the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government has been very active in promoting mega events and hoping to attract a lot of tourists as well as Greater Bay Area citizens to Hong Kong. So the book fair, I think we play a part in it,” said Sophia Chong, deputy executive director of the Trade Development Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s quite attractive in getting all the families and also the Greater Bay Area fans and even from Southeast Asia to come to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chong also said all exhibitors are aware of the need to comply with laws relating to national security, as well as other regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have been asking our exhibitors to observe the rules and regulations of the Hong Kong Book Fair… They have been very observant in observing all these rules and regulations and also the rules in Hong Kong, including the [National Security Law] as well as the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, will run from July 17 to July 23, with the Sports and Leisure Expo and the World of Snacks taking place at the venue at the same time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Tuesday said it achieved record-breaking earnings in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the opening of its "World of Frozen" attraction last November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The first quarter of 2024 was our most successful quarter ever, achieving record-level revenues, [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] and net income. These results are our continued focus on creating the best place to work for our amazing cast members in the power of Disney brand and franchises," said the resort's managing director Michael Moriarty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland also noted its net loss had shrunk by 83 percent to HK$356 million in the fiscal year of October 2022 to September 2023 while year-on-year revenue grew by 156 percent to HK$5.7 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park attributed the boost to a strong rebound in both local and non-local travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total attendance last year grew by 87 percent to 6.4 million with the number of local visitors reaching a record-high, the company said, and a rebound in mainland China visitors was particularly strong, but there was also growth in visitor numbers from Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland had operated at a loss for nine fiscal years in a row, but Moriarty highlighted that the park actually turned profitable if the number was calculated from January to December 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we look at the fiscal year, I think you have to really look at it in two ways - there’s a lot of old news in there, and our losses that we suffered as a result of COVID are very similar to those during the previous years during COVID that everyone suffered through,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But as soon as the masks came off, our business took off. And literally, immediately out of the gate, we started to out-pace the market's recovery. And that's when we really started to turn profitable right away, in the summer of last fiscal year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that demand for the resort’s three hotels was also recovering strongly, with a more than 90 percent booking rate observed in the first three months of 2024.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bernadette Linn said the government has always played the gatekeeping role when it comes to harbourfront protection." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758974_1_20240625162749.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday criticised a concern group for claiming that proposed changes to harbour protection laws would strip the courts of the power to adjudicate on controversies involving reclamation projects in Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Society for Protection of the Harbour had argued that legal changes aimed at making it easier for smaller reclamation projects to be carried out will shift gatekeeping powers from the courts to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Linn told lawmakers at a development panel meeting that such gatekeeping has always been carried out by the government and if the legal amendments are approved, people will still be able to challenge decisions by way of a judicial review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary said the default position will continue to be that large-scale reclamation in the harbour is banned unless there is an overriding public need for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Executive Council makes a decision on such a project, the public would have a chance to have their say on the matter, Linn added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary would make decisions on whether to allow smaller projects, or those that are only temporary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn stressed that the government has no plans to carry out large-scale reclamation in Victoria Harbour for housing, commercial or industrial developments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of the amendment is to improve harbourfront connectivity, enhance harbourfront areas for public enjoyment, or strengthen functions the harbour ought to have," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All the councillors at the meeting expressed their support for the proposed changes, with several saying they hope more facilities will be approved around the harbour to improve people's livelihoods.

    Israeli court says ultra-Orthodox men can be drafted

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled unanimously that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for military service, a decision that could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition as Israel continues to wage war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that in the absence of a law that distinguishes between Jewish seminary students and other draftees, Israel’s compulsory military service system applies to the ultra-Orthodox like any other citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under long-standing arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men have been exempt from the draft, which is compulsory for most Jewish men and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These exemptions have long been a source of anger among the secular public, a divide that has widened during the eight-month-old war, as the military has called up tens of thousands of soldiers and says it needs all the manpower it can get. Over 600 soldiers have been killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, key partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, oppose any change in the current system. If the exemptions are ended, they could bolt the coalition, causing the government to collapse and leading to new elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court decision comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza drags on into its ninth month and the number of dead soldiers continues to mount. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About half of Hong Kong's financial institutions are using virtual assets in their business operations, according to a report released on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) -- an affiliate of the Monetary Authority -- surveyed 59 entities, including those from the banking, insurance and asset management sectors between May and July last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey revealed that 53 percent of firms were using virtual assets, while 85 percent expected virtual assets to be part of their core business operations in the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the institute's head, Giorgio Valente, said financial institutions are cautious about the application of virtual assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the moment, because people are trying to understand how to maximise the benefits, while learning about its vulnerabilities, these elements obviously would actually impact the effective adoption. But going forward, we expect the situation eventually may improve," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente added that Hong Kong remained attractive as a virtual assets hub, as the SAR had a well-defined regulatory framework and robust financial infrastructure.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese lunar probe has returned to Earth with the first ever samples collected from the moon's far side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 touched down in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region shortly after 2pm on Tuesday, completing its complex and challenging 53-day lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The returner of [the] Chang'e-6 mission has landed successfully at Siziwang Banner, at the designated area. I would like to announce that the Chang'e-6 lunar mission has achieved a complete success," said Zhang Kejian, the director of the China National Space Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also extended his congratulations on the complete success of the lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a congratulatory message carried by state media, Xi said the "outstanding contributions" of the mission command "will be remembered forever by the motherland and the people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The re-entry capsule brought back lunar soil and rocks that it spent two days collecting by a drill and robotic arm from the side of the moon that faces away from Earth. It would be brought to Beijing for further studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang'e-6 blasted off from a space centre in Hainan on May 3, and descended into the moon's immense South Pole-Aitken Basin almost exactly a month later.

 National security police on Tuesday charged a man with writing words with seditious intention on the back of bus seats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said the writing, found on public buses in March and April, provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention", contravening Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was also charged with destroying or damaging property.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A DAB lawmaker on Tuesday called on the government to beautify Sham Shui Po, to attract more visitors to the district.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Vincent Cheng, who represents the Kowloon West geographical constituency, said businesses in Sham Shui Po are struggling to survive as more Hongkongers head north for tourism and shopping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said the government should begin with enhancing the appeal of Apliu Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apliu Street is one of the really historical streets. It's full of different kinds of electricity products, especially the old cameras, the old CDs, a lot of different musical stuff over there. So we do think there are a lot of visitors going around there every day. So we do think there's a good attraction," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, the government can have some promotion or revamp to make sure that everyone knows that Apliu Street is really good for the tourists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also suggested installing figures of the district's mascot, known as "Sham Duck", and renovating the "pai dong" hawker stalls in the area.

 Afghanistan reached the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup with a dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh under the Duckworth Lewis System in St Vincent on Monday, joining India as the qualifiers from Group 1 and sending Australia home.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh also had a chance to progress or send Australia through with a victory but the Afghans dismissed them for 105 to take the win they needed to set up a first World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Trinidad on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan hopes were dented when they were restricted to a modest 115-5 as showers around the ground threatened to change the calculations, but skipper Rashid Khan took 4-23 and Naveen-ul-Haq 4-26 in a defiant bowling effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, who beat Australia by 24 runs earlier in St Lucia to leave the qualification hopes of the 2021 champions hanging by a thread, will take on title holders England in the second semi-final in Guyana on Thursday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lacklustre Brazil launched their Copa America campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Costa Rica on Monday as James Rodriguez inspired Colombia to a 2-1 win over Paraguay in the other Group D game.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brazil, chasing a 10th Copa America crown, dominated possession and territory at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles but struggled to break down a resolute Costa Rica.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazilians thought they had taken the lead in the 30th minute after Marquinhos tapped in at the back post after a flick on by Rodrygo following a free-kick by Raphinha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after an agonising VAR delay, the goal was chalked off for a fractional offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costa Rica were content to sit back, defending in numbers and rarely venturing forward with any purpose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They failed to have a single shot on goal for the entire game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodriguez, whose club career has languished in the decade since he rose to prominence with a dazzling performance at the 2014 World Cup, created both of Colombia's goals at Houston in Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old midfielder, who has played just a handful of minutes for Brazilian club Sao Paulo in the two months leading into the Copa America, set up the opening goal for Colombia in the 32nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten minutes later Colombia doubled their lead and again it was a goal engineered by the trusty left foot of Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time the goal arrived from the opposite flank, with Rodriguez swinging in a wicked free-kick that was glanced in by Crystal Palace midfielder Jefferson Lerma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That made it 2-0 at half time to leave Colombia firmly on course to extend their unbeaten streak to 24 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia continued to carve out the better chances in the second half, but Paraguay set up a nervy finish after Brighton's Julio Enciso pulled one back in the 69th minute. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the upcoming July 1 holiday is a special day that people should celebrate freely, while warning of potential "undesirable activities".
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told reporters that he believed people would cherish the current safe and stable situation in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that people will celebrate July 1 happily. At the same time, we have to stay vigilant against undesirable activities taking place, say for example, activities that hijack this important date," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have stability, our security is safeguarded. I'm sure people will look forward to the celebrations. Police will take into account the situation and make arrangements as necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the absence of demonstrations on July 1, the chief executive said there are many ways and channels for people to express their opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee is set to lead a delegation of principal officials to Guangzhou on Thursday for an annual conference, with discussions on past achievements and future cooperation in areas such as innovation and technology, finance, and healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong would help contribute to the high-quality development of the Greater Bay Area, adding there were unlimited opportunities for both sides.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong airport officials must make improvements and ensure a glitch that affected many passengers over the weekend does not happen again, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, a computer malfunction paralysed real-time flight information updates on the airport's display screens, as well as on digital platforms, for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said although no flights had to be cancelled, the glitch affected a lot of passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that transport authorities immediately met Airport Authority management regarding the incident, and that airport bosses had been told to submit a detailed report to prevent similar incidents from happening in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have asked the Airport Authority to conduct a comprehensive review of the system, including its backup system, to upgrade its capacity in activating the system and to review its risk management measures amid the completion of the third runway system," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong International Airport is an international aviation hub. It is of paramount importance to provide high-quality and stable services to passengers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Preliminary findings showed there were issues with activating the authority's backup system following the glitch.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday said the Chinese economy had gotten off to a "good start" this year, and that the nation will continue to strive to create an open environment for technological innovations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li made the remarks at a keynote speech at the opening of a World Economic Forum meeting – also known as Summer Davos – in Dalian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said: "The rapid growth of new industries and new drivers has buttressed the sound and sustained development of the Chinese economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the start of this year the Chinese economy has sustained the momentum of recovery. It got off to a good start in the first quarter of this year... and continued steady growth in the second quarter. We're confident and capable in achieving the growth target of around five percent for this year," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also proposed that there should be a deepening of exchanges and cooperation in science and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Science and technology are key variables in future development and major sci-tech progress usually comes from unrelenting research accumulation and extensive cooperation," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier also told delegates that the nation's electric vehicles and lithium batteries were not only meeting domestic demand, but also enriching global supply amid trade tensions with the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 1,600 leading figures from the public and private sectors across nearly 80 countries and regions are attending the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions event which is being held until June 27. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that power company CLP must get to the bottom of a series of power outages in recent months, adding that he's highly concerned about the matter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said before the weekly Executive Council meeting that CLP needs to improve in a number of areas to ensure a stable and reliable power supply, which he stressed is important to the people and the territory's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary for CLP to identify the root causes of the problems, make fundamental improvements to reduce the chance of similar incidents in the future," the CE told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some systems may have been running for a long time, so it is important that they're always well-maintained, then there'll be a good system to ensure that periodic checks take place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said it is essential for the company to deploy more manpower to improve its response to emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials will follow up on CLP's plans to enhance its overall power supply system capabilities and reduce the risks brought by adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm had said that a voltage dip in the early hours of Sunday may have been caused by the weather.

    Florida win first Stanley Cup in franchise history

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Florida Panthers dug deep against the Edmonton Oilers to win 2-1 in a closely-fought Game 7, ensuring their first ever Stanley Cup title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe scored goals for the home team while Sergei Bobrovsky made 23 saves on their way to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mattias Janmark had the goal for Edmonton and Stuart Skinner stopped 19 shots for the Oilers, but they couldn’t end Canada’s title drought in the tournament; it’s been 1993 and counting since a team based in Canada has won the Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Florida, it was the third title-round appearance in their 30-year history; they were swept in 1996 by Colorado and routed 4-1 by Vegas last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, they were on the right side of history — after avoiding what would have been a historic collapse. The Panthers won the first three games of the series, then lost the next three and needed a win on Monday to avoid joining the 1942 Detroit Red Wings as the only teams to lose the final after taking a 3-0 lead in the title round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn’t easy. Not even close. But it's done. It took until the very end for the Panthers to deny Connor McDavid his first title, and the Oilers what would have been their first Cup since 2006. (AP)

    HK to host world youth summit in August: Mak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alice Mak says August's youth summit will provide a platform for meaningful exchanges between people from all over the world. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758913_1_20240625105757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, said a summit would be held in August to provide an opportunity for young people from different places to come together and exchange ideas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, Mak said more than 1,000 youth leaders and speakers from different parts of the world, including the mainland, would be invited to the Youth Development Summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said young people attending the event could understand global development trends and plan their future effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main objective is to create a platform where people from different places can meet our outstanding young people. They can learn about the remarkable qualities and potential of our youth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, our young friends in Hong Kong will have the opportunity to interact with people from other cities and meet various youth leaders. This will enable them to broaden their horizons and foster more meaningful exchanges".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said the government was working well with district councils and care teams to provide comprehensive support to people living in different areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said district councillors and care teams regularly visit residents to understand their needs and find solutions to problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing the example of a deadly fire in Jordan in April, Mak said that without the cooperation between care teams and district councils, the government would not have been able to provide services to affected residents as efficiently and effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have more partners in the districts. We are no longer relying on the government's resources and capacity alone."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Julian Assange's wife Stella on Tuesday thanked campaigners for their support as the WikiLeaks founder was released after five years in British custody.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Julian is free!!!!" she wrote on the social media platform X following confirmation that he had left Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Words cannot express our immense gratitude" to everyone who had backed the global push for his release, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stella Assange met the Australian publisher while he was holed up in Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges that were later dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange, accused of divulging US military secrets related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been due back in court in London next month after winning an appeal against extradition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But WikiLeaks said in a statement: "Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1,901 days there.

  "He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stansted airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The media freedom group said sustained campaigning, from grassroots supporters to political leaders and the United Nations, "created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice", leading to a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation said the deal "has not yet been formally finalised".

  Assange was initially detained for skipping bail in relation to the Swedish case and held in custody while the US extradition request wound its way through court.

  He will now be reunited with his wife, whom he married at a ceremony in the prison, and their two young children, it added.

  "As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom. Julian's freedom is our freedom." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungary's forward Barnabas Varga had successful surgery on Monday after suffering a facial fracture in Sunday's 1-0 win over Scotland at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old suffered the injury when he clashed with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the box after 68 minutes and appeared to be knocked out, needing urgent medical attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was taken to hospital and was in a stable condition before his surgery on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information of the institution's doctors specialising in facial injuries, the intervention was uncomplicated, so the attacker ... can leave the hospital on Wednesday," the Hungarian football federation said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga's girlfriend shared a picture of her holding his hand in hospital with the message: "Thank you for the kind, supportive messages. Barni is over the surgery. A little rest awaits him, but everything will be fine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai had criticised medical staff for the length of time it took for Varga to get treatment on the pitch during the Group A game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga will not play any part in the rest of Hungary's campaign, should they qualify for the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win over Scotland ensured Hungary finished third in their group, but they must wait on other results to see if they qualify as one of the four best third-place finishers. (Reuters)

    Last-gasp Zaccagni saves Italy as Spain top group

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Luka Modric and Gianluigi Donnarumma react after the match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758888_1_20240625080827.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mattia Zaccagni kept Italy's European Championship title defence alive with an incredible late equaliser in the holder's thrilling 1-1 draw with Croatia, as Spain completed a perfect group stage and showed Albania the door.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Italy are in the last 16 of Euro 2024 after forward Zaccagni struck a superb equaliser with almost the last kick of the game in Leipzig, sparking an explosion of joy among the Italian fans and even a sprint up the line from 65-year-old coach Luciano Spalletti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Azzurri will play Switzerland in the next round thanks to Zaccagni, who came on with nine minutes remaining and curled in his leveller in the eighth minute of stoppage time following a brilliant burst and pass from defender Riccardo Calafiori.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody believed any more, but the players did," Spalletti told Sky Sport in Italy, before raging at critics in the Italian press pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a furious press conference Spalletti said "I inject myself with this venom" which he said was coming "from all sides" and blasted unnamed people within Italy's camp for potentially leaking his team's formation to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spalletti's team finish Group B in second place on four points, five behind winners Spain who beat Albania 1-0 thanks to a neat Ferran Torres finish in the 13th minute in Dusseldorf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albania's Euros adventure is over following a defeat which also means that England, France and the Netherlands are guaranteed a place in the next round at least as one of the four best third-placed teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia meanwhile are all-but out due to Zaccagni's late equaliser just as it looked as if Luka Modric was once again going to be the hero for his country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modric defied his advancing years by firing Croatia into the lead nine minutes after the break and becoming the oldest goalscorer in Euros history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 38 years and 289 days old, Modric broke the record set by Austrian Ivica Vastic in 2008, pouncing on a rebound after Gianluigi Donnarumma made an incredible save from Ante Budimir's point-blank range header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modric made up for Donnarumma pushing away his penalty just moments before, but his goal wasn't enough and on two points third-placed Croatia's hopes are hanging by a thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's hard when you lose like this to find the words to describe how you feel," said Modric. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='A government spokesman said: "We vehemently oppose and firmly reject the unfounded and false remarks in the Report against the situation in Hong Kong." Photo: RTHK' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758874_1_20240625052908.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has hit back at what it calls "unsubstantiated remarks" from the US State Department in its latest Trafficking in Persons Report, which said Hong Kong was actively being used by syndicates as a destination or transit point for human trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR government said it vehemently opposed and firmly rejected what it called unfounded and false remarks in the report about the situation in Hong Kong. The SAR statement said trafficking in persons was never a prevalent problem in the city, and there had never been any sign that Hong Kong was actively used by syndicates to conduct such activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the rating of Hong Kong as Tier 2 on its Watch List was "unfair, misconceived, and not substantiated by facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government said it had been making proactive and multi-pronged efforts in the fight against trafficking in persons, and had injected an enormous amount of resources into combating the issue, as well as enhancing protection for foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong. It said the government spared no effort in conducting initial screenings for all persons vulnerable to trafficking risks, including illegal immigrants, sex workers, illegal workers, helpers, imported labour and other suspected victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in 2023, it screened 11,000 people, representing an increase of 45 percent compared to the previous year. It found only three victims, which demonstrated that trafficking in persons wasn't prevalent or widespread in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said it would be baseless and unfair to cast doubt on the city's quality of screenings just because of the low number of the victims identified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also noted that in 2018, it established a high-level steering committee that provided policy on human trafficking and protection of foreign domestic helpers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mixed on Monday, with industrial companies lifting the Dow and a retreat by some of the hottest tech names weighing on the Nasdaq.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts described the market as in a wait-and-see mode ahead of major news events this week, including a US presidential debate and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 39,411.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.3 percent to 5,447, while the Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 17,496.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's some natural rotation just given how massive the outperformance between the big tech stocks and the artificial intelligence momentum plays has been relative to the broader market," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's just a kind of a natural consolidation and rotation trade taking place there."
  <br/>

  Ahead of the Thursday night debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump and Friday's report on personal consumption pricing, the calendar includes earnings from FedEx and consumer confidence data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AI star Nvidia, which has risen spectacularly over the last year to attain a market capitalisation above US$3 trillion, fell 6.7 percent in the stock's third straight down day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other big AI-linked equities including Qualcomm, Broadcom and Arm Holdings also fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Target rose 2.4 percent after announcing a partnership with global commerce platform Shopify intended to boost Target Plus, the big box store's digital marketplace. Shopify fell 1.1 percent. (AFP)

    EU accuses Apple of breaking bloc's new digital rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Under the new Digital Markets Act, the European Commission has the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758864_1_20240625015852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple risks billions of euros in fines after the European Union on Monday accused the iPhone maker of violating the bloc's landmark digital rules by hindering competition on its App Store.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The European Commission informed Apple in a "preliminary view" that the "App Store rules... prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finding opens a new front in the increasingly bitter fight between the US tech giant and Brussels over the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), and may force changes to the way the App Store operates in the bloc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Apple said it would delay rolling out recently announced AI features in Europe because of "regulatory uncertainties" linked to the DMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sweeping law seeks to rein in the world's biggest tech firms, including Apple, by forcing them to open up to competition in the 27-country EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for Apple, the new rules are a significant challenge to its walled garden and it has openly accused the DMA of creating greater privacy and security risks for users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time the commission has levelled a formal accusation against a tech firm under the new rules, after opening the first DMA probes into Apple, Google and Meta in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple said on Monday that it has made "a number of changes" to comply with the rules in response to feedback from developers and the EU regulator over the past months, and would "continue to listen and engage with the European Commission."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple can now access the commission's investigation file and reply to the findings. If Apple falls in line with EU rules, it can avoid a fine and Brussels believes it will give European users easier access to cheaper offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the commission's view is confirmed, it would adopt a "non-compliance decision" by late March 2025 – opening the way to fines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new law, the commission has the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five per cent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion (358 billion euros).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU also has the right to break up companies, but only as a last resort. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rohit Sharma smashes another four on his way to a sensational 92. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758866_1_20240625031528.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rohit Sharma led from the front with a blistering 92 as India beat Australia by 24 runs in St Lucia on Monday to seal their place in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The India captain's dashing innings – he faced just 41 balls, including seven fours and eight sixes – was the cornerstone of a total of 205-5 made after he lost the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia eventually finished their reply on 181-7, with left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh taking 3-37.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India will now face defending champions England in Thursday's semi-final in Guyana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat meant Australia's fate was no longer in their own hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan, who produced a stunning upset in beating Australia by 21 runs last time out, will qualify for the semi-finals if they defeat Bangladesh later on Monday in the concluding Group One game of the Super Eights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia lost David Warner for just six when the veteran left-handed opener was undone by a full-length delivery from Arshdeep that he could only edge to Suryakumar Yadav at slip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travis Head, whose superb century crushed Indian dreams of a 50-over World Cup final win on home soil last year, kept Australia in the hunt with a well-made 76 off 43 balls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His second-wicket stand of 81 with skipper Mitchell Marsh looked to be turning the tide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Marsh was brilliantly caught one-handed on the boundary by a leaping Axar Patel off Kuldeep Yadav for 37.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep then bowled dangerman Glenn Maxwell for 20 with a superb 'wrong-un' on his way to fine figures of 2-24 in his maximum four overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And when Head holed out off a superbly-disguised slower ball from paceman Jasprit Bumrah, Australia were all but beaten at 150-5 in the 17th over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, India star batsman Virat Kohli holed out for a five-ball duck off Josh Hazlewood, with Tim David taking a fine running catch over his shoulder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fellow opener Rohit then cut loose. He was particularly severe on Mitchell Starc, the only change to the Australia team following their upset defeat by Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hit the left-arm fast bowler for 29 runs in a third over where he struck four sixes – two in successive balls over extra-cover, a monster hit over deep midwicket and a top-edged full toss over the wicketkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with Rohit threatening the first hundred of this tournament, Starc bowled him with an excellent yorker. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jordan Bardella is credited with helping the National Rally party to clean up its extremist image. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758863_1_20240625013313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French far-right leader Jordan Bardella said on Monday his party was ready to govern as he pledged to curb immigration and tackle cost-of-living issues ahead of the country's most divisive election in decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In three words: we are ready," the 28-year-old president of the National Rally (RN) told a press conference as he unveiled his party's programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron threw France into turmoil earlier this month by calling the snap election after his centrist party was trounced by the far-right National Rally (RN) in a European vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekend polls suggested the RN would win 35-36 percent in the first round on Sunday, ahead of a left-wing alliance on 27-29.5 percent and Macron's centrists in third on 19.5-22 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella, credited with helping the RN clean up its extremist image, has urged voters to give the eurosceptic party an outright majority to allow it to implement its anti-immigration, law-and-order programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seven long years of Macronism has weakened the country," he said, vowing to boost purchasing power, "restore order" and change the law to make it easier to deport foreigners convicted of crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He reiterated plans to tighten borders and make it harder for foreigners born on French soil to gain citizenship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been 30 years the French have not been listened to on this subject," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella added that the RN would focus on "realistic" measures to curb inflation, primarily by cutting energy taxes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also promised a disciplinary "big bang" in schools, including a ban on mobile phones and trialling the introduction of school uniforms, a proposal previously put forward by Macron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign policy, Bardella said the RN opposed sending French troops into Ukraine – as mooted by Macron – but would continue to provide logistical and material support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his party, which had close ties to Russia before its war in Ukraine, would be "extremely vigilant" in the face of Moscow's attempts to interfere in French affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election is shaping up as a showdown between the RN and the leftist New Popular Front, which is dominated by the hard-left France Unbowed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Popular Front has so far refused to say who would be its candidate for prime minister if it wins, with several key figures urging the polarising France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc Melenchon to step back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella claimed the RN, which mainstream parties have in the past united to block, was now the "patriotic and republican" choice faced with what he alleged was the anti-Semitism of Melenchon's party.

  France Unbowed, which vocally opposes Israel's war in Gaza and refused to label the October 7 Hamas attacks as "terrorism," strongly denies the charges of anti-Semitism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In calling an election in just three weeks Macron hoped to trip up his opponents and catch them unprepared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts have warned the move could backfire spectacularly if the deeply unpopular president is forced to share power with a prime minister from an opposing party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marine Le Pen, the RN's figurehead who is bidding to succeed him as president, has called on him to step aside if he loses control of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has insisted he will not resign before the end of his second term in 2027 but has vowed to heed voters' concerns and change course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal cannot be to just continue as things were," Macron said in an open letter in French media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has urged the French not to make the election a referendum on his leadership, saying it is not "a vote of confidence in the president of the republic".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Macron's prime minister Gabriel Attal will go head-to-head with Bardella in a TV debate. (AFP)

 England spinner Shoaib Bashir made unwanted history on Monday when he conceded 38 runs in a single over in an English county championship match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Bashir, playing for Worcestershire, was put away for five straight sixes by England teammate Dan Lawrence, playing for Surrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sixth ball of Bashir’s over was sent so far down the leg side that it went for five wides, and there was worse to follow for Bashir when he overstepped with his next delivery, giving away a no-ball – and therefore two runs – along with a single for Lawrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Lawrence off strike, Bashir actually managed a dot ball with his last delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It tied the most expensive over in County Championship history. Alex Tudor also conceded 38 runs for Surrey against Lancashire in 1998, with former England allrounder Andrew Flintoff hitting 34 of the runs on that occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was only the 12th first-class match for Bashir, who made his England test debut on the tour of India in February and March. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='President Cyril Ramaphosa faces the tricky task of announcing an "inclusive" cabinet in the coming days. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758857_1_20240625001659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's weakened African National Congress (ANC) denounced on Monday "outrageous demands" for cabinet positions by its coalition partners in documents leaked to the press amid negotiations to form a government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Cyril Ramaphosa, 71, who has been re-elected for a second full term, will lead what his ANC calls a government of national unity after losing its outright majority in the May 29 general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The historied ANC of the late Nelson Mandela has governed South Africa since the advent of democracy in 1994 but only scored 40 percent of the vote last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC "notes with concern that some parties have been making outlandish and outrageous demands for specific cabinet positions in the media," the party said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, local media have reported tensions in negotiations between the ANC and the largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which won 87 parliamentary seats compared to the ANC's 159.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa faces having to balance demands for key ministerial posts from his party and its new allies, as well as mediating diverging views to agree a common policy agenda on the economy and other pressing matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But almost a month after the vote, no official communication has been made on the number of portfolios that will go to the new parties in government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of state is expected to announce an "inclusive" cabinet in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national unity government has 10 parties in total, including the DA, the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and other smaller groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A document, apparently from the DA and showing its letterhead outlining a list of preferred cabinet positions, has circulated on social media, stirring debate among South Africans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is... reasonable and fair that the DA should have representation across all cabinet clusters. To speed matters along, we set out here our preferred portfolios," the document reads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list includes the energy, transport, justice, home affairs and foreign ministries, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Negotiating through leaking demands to the media is an act of bad faith and this practice will not help the cause of any party," the ANC said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the meeting Duda told Xi that relations between Poland and China remained strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russia-Ukraine conflict was on the agenda for talks, but no remarks on the issue were delivered before journalists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Over the past 75 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, bilateral relations have maintained steady development, constantly injecting new vitality into the traditional friendship between the two countries,” Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides announced during the meeting that China would implement a 15-day unilateral visa-free policy for Polish citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several trade agreements were signed following the meeting between the two leaders, including on Polish agricultural exports and educational exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duda has further meetings in Beijing and will fly to the financial hub of Shanghai to attend a Poland-China economic forum. (Xinhua/AP)

    'Most victims of South Korean fire were Chinese'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's fire department on Monday said 18 of the 22 killed in a massive blaze at a lithium battery factory were Chinese nationals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries were being inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the massive blaze that ensued, twenty-two people were killed, including 20 foreign nationals -- 18 Chinese, one from Laos, and one of unknown nationality, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most of the bodies are badly burned so it will take some time to identify each one," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were still searching for one more person who remained unaccounted for, Kim said, adding they had managed to contain the largest blaze at the plant and get inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were "doing cooling operations to prevent the fire from expanding to nearby factories," Kim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vast factory had an estimated 35,000 battery cells on the second floor in storage, with more batteries stored in other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lithium batteries burn hot and fast, and are difficult to control with conventional fire extinguishing methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to fears of additional explosions, it was difficult to enter," Kim said, describing the tricky rescue operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As it is a lithium battery manufacturer, we (had) determined that spraying water will not extinguish the fire, so we (used) dry sand," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Court of Final Appeal hears the case of the seven defendants on Monday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758819_1_20240624184755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Final Appeal on Monday reserved judgement in a case of seven defendants and their involvement in an unauthorised procession in 2019, with the arguments from the prosecution and defence centring on the issue of proportionality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six former lawmakers – Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung – and Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the demonstration on August 18, 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had approved an assembly at Victoria Park on that day, but banned a march out of the venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeal earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, but upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also lowered by several months the defendants’ jail sentences, which ranged from suspended terms to up to 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final appeal by the seven defendants, the defence lawyers argued at the city's top court that because police didn’t make any arrests on the day and the demonstration was peaceful, their subsequent arrests and convictions were “operationally disproportionate”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, arguing a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The courts, they argued, must protect such rights as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice (DOJ) countered that there was nothing in the law to support a proportionality test at the conviction stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Counsel Benjamin Yu, for the DOJ, also argued the defence had not raised the issue before, and had no ground to do so now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not simply they were engaged in an unauthorised procession, it was also that they knowingly violated the prohibition by police,” Yu told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, reserved judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the defendants attended the hearing. Lai and Leung, who are in custody over separate national security cases, did not attend. Cyd Ho, who had finished serving her sentence over this case, was also absent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said the restructuring of the government's arts and culture promotion agency marks a milestone in the industry's development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung attended the launching ceremony of the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA), which is the successor to Create Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CCIDA aims to be a one-stop shop for the sector, in areas such as intellectual property and content distribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the ceremony, Yeung said the formation of the new agency is part of the government's efforts to turn Hong Kong into a global hub for arts and cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency is taking on a new mission to create a better environment in Hong Kong, with an industry-oriented approach as a guiding principle to further promote the development of culture, art, and creative industries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries Victor Tsang said CCIDA will focus more on the industrialisation of the arts and cultural sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Create Hong Kong focused more on the nurturing of talent and also explored more markets. But... we actually have to discuss more with each of the industries whether we can do a series of support in terms of different projects in order to bring them up to another level, maybe even at the top of the world. And this is what our strategy will do," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-owned investment vehicle has struck a deal with a biotechnology firm started by the founder of Chinese internet giant Baidu, the second such strategic partnership announced in just two weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Cooperation (HKIC) on Monday signed a cooperation deal with BioMap, which specialises in life science.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, co-founded by Robin Li who also started Baidu, is the second company the HKIC has partnered with. Earlier this month, the investment vehicle signed another agreement with SmartMore, a technology company specialising in artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had a solid foundation in both artificial intelligence and life science, and he was confident more tech companies would come to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a complete funding chain, ranging from a rich private equity and venture capital ecosystem to a deep and wide listing platform," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that more tech companies will choose Hong Kong as their base for [research and development] and international cooperation as well as a platform to explore the broader Asian and global market. And of course, we welcome companies such as BioMap to list on our stock exchange, using our world-class fundraising platform to grow bigger and stronger."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clara Chan, the chief executive officer of HKIC, said the strategic partnerships would focus on the application of artificial intelligence, which had become "the backbone technology for future creation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will not only invest in BioMap, but also lead the current financing round. Leading the round means that the HKIC is setting the parameters and terms of this round for other investors to follow," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the partnership, the tech firm will set up its international innovation centre called BioMap InnoHub, which aims to support more than 50 early-stage research and development projects in the life sciences.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP Power says it will continue to install protective devices at its transmission towers that are more likely to be affected by inclement weather. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758799_1_20240624152506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There were calls on Monday for CLP Power to weather-proof its transmission towers to ensure they withstand the impact of inclement weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The electricity supplier said it had begun installing such facilities and would continue to do so in the coming two to three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm, which supplies electricity to Kowloon and the New Territories and most of the outlying islands in Hong Kong, set out short-, medium-, and long-term measures to deal with power interruptions, after reports of a power outage in buildings from a voltage dip on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power supply might have been affected by unstable weather as the thunderstorm warning was in force at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Short-term measures include increasing manpower and resources to minimise the recurrence of power disruptions and restore electricity as quickly as possible, while measures would be taken over the medium term to boost protection of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the long run, the electricity supplier would review its asset management and maintenance with the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Wing-yip, an electrical and building services engineer, said the firm should prioritise protective devices for its transmission towers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the rainy season has just started with typhoons expected, the priority should be on implementing waterproofing and anti-lightning facilities. There must be some kind of priority, because there's quite a number of transmission towers, with over 100 of them in the New Territories," Ho told an RTHK programme on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we need to put in place such measures, we have to be selective. Some of the transmission towers are on mountain tops, and they are more prone to be struck by lightning, so they should be dealt with first given the limited resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, CLP's senior director, power systems, told the same programme there would be more anti-lightning devices in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had begun installing anti-lightning devices as early as 20 years ago, for the sake of risk management. We referenced data from the Observatory, and installed anti-lightning devices at areas that were more likely to be struck by lightning," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the change in climate, there is a rising thunder frequency, so we will set up these protection devices in high, middle, and even low risk areas. We hope to do that in areas that we considered to have such a risk in the coming two to three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cheung did not say whether the firm would compensate affected residents, only noting the electricity supplier was focusing on preventing more future power outages.

    Applications open for new light public housing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Applications open for new light public housing" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758801_1_20240624153949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications opened on Monday for the first batch of light public housing flats, with hundreds of hopefuls turning up at the Housing Authority's office in Lok Fu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said it had received some 1,800 applications by 6pm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The modular homes are a stop-gap measure designed to improve the living conditions of those waiting for public housing, with priority given to families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants, who must have been on the waiting list for public housing for at least three years, will still be eligible for traditional flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Accompanying her mother, Bibi said getting one of the new flats would help them save money on rent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the money we pay for rent in private, we can save HK$7,800. I hope my mom can get [a flat] as we don't know who can get them as there are many people applying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Law said he lives in a subdivided flat in Tseung Kwan O and has been queuing for a public unit for four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government rolled out the [light public housing] plan and I am eligible, so I came here to apply. It is undoubtedly better than living in subdivided flats, it has everything," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lee, 64, said he would like to move to one of the modular flats while he waits to get a traditional unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now I live in To Kwa Wan, one of the subdivided apartments in Hong Kong. The living condition is poor and there is [only] enough room for myself and my dog," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants will be notified by the last quarter of this year.

 Authorities in the Russian region of Dagestan on Monday said an operation against gunmen who attacked churches and synagogues and killed at least 20 people was over.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens more were wounded in the attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following the neutralisation of the threats to the lives and health of citizens, it was decided to end the anti-terrorist operation in Dagestan," Russia's National Antiterrorism Committee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gunmen who stormed churches and a synagogue in the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region on Sunday killed 15 police officers and a priest, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks took place in the Dagestan capital Makhachkala and nearby Derbent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over 15 police fell victim to the terrorist act," Dagestan's regional leader Sergei Melikov said in a video posted on Telegram, adding that they "protected civilians...at the cost of their lives".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial death toll given was eight police officers and a priest. (AFP)

    At least 20 dead in South Korea lithium plant fire

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 20 bodies have been found at a South Korean lithium battery factory after a massive blaze on Monday, the Yonhap news agency said, with firefighters saying they were still searching the building.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries are inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 78 people were confirmed safe but many more were still missing, with Yonhap saying that "about 20 bodies (were) found" at the site, after rescue workers finally managed to get inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim told media that they had managed to put out the largest fire at the factory and were pulling bodies out of the charred building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A rescue team has gone inside and is carrying out search and rescue operations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building. Dozens of fire engines were seen outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vast factory had an estimated 35,000 battery cells on the second floor in storage, with more batteries stored in other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lithium batteries burn hot and fast, and are difficult to control with conventional fire extinguishing methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to fears of additional explosions, it was difficult to enter," Kim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As it is a lithium battery manufacturer, we determined that spraying water will not extinguish the fire, so we are currently using dry sand," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lithium batteries are used in everything from laptops to electric vehicles -- but can be highly explosive, with airlines, for example, imposing strict regulations on checking devices containing them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol issued emergency instructions to authorities, telling them to "mobilise all available personnel and equipment to focus on searching for and rescuing people," his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also warned authorities that they should "ensure the safety of firefighters considering the rapid spread of fire".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighting and rescue efforts were ongoing, and the cause of the fire was unknown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Hwaseong sent out a series of alerts to residents warning them to stay inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a lot of smoke due to factory fires. Please pay attention to safety, such as refraining from going out," one alert sent by text message said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Factory fire. Please detour to surrounding roads and nearby citizens please close windows," another one read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea is a major producer of batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its battery makers supply EV makers around the world, including Tesla.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea is also one of the world's largest producers of high-end semiconductors, and the government has invested heavily in key technologies including displays and batteries. (AFP)

    Civil servants must safeguard national security: Yeung

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, has said it is most important for government workers to uphold the constitutional order and national security, according to the code of conduct for civil servants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities earlier revised the Civil Service Code, which lays out 12 fundamental values and standards of conduct, including political neutrality, confidentiality, and integrity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current government term, Yeung pointed out that civil servants are obligated to protect national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 12 values are all important. If I need to choose the most important value in the Civil Service Code, I'd agree it's the first one: upholding the constitutional order and national security," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The work of civil servants is not just a job or a means to achieve personal accomplishments or earn a salary. It is a mission. Civil servants have their constitutional roles to fulfill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the government is streamlining the civil service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From March 2021 until now, our civil service establishment have decreased by some 1,000 or nearly 2,000 [positions]. We have achieved this through various means, such as using more technology and streamlining procedures. We constantly review our processes which are no longer necessary. By eliminating those procedures, we can allocate manpower to other tasks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, on dental benefits for government workers, Yeung said the government is thinking about purchasing dental services in the Greater Bay Area, so that civil servants can access these benefits across the border.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China strategist Andrew Leung says Hong Kong has made advances in the field of social welfare over the past two years, although government departments still need to take more initiative when it comes to talking to one another.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comments on RTHK's
  <i>
   Hong Kong Today
  </i>
  programme as he was discussing next week's 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the two years in office of Chief Executive John Lee and his governing team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a number of achievements, for example on the social welfare front. You know, I have been Director of Social Welfare for four years before [former Chief Executive] Carrie Lam. So I'm quite familiar with this kind of improvement of various services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The establishment of the care teams, for example, actually translates kind of empty ideas into concrete actions. So I think that's very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Care teams were announced in the 2022 Policy Address. Coming under the Home Affairs Department, they support the government's district work, including visiting the needy and providing support during incidents and emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also said many government departments still tended to operate within their own structures, undermining efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regularly, people are not satisfied with the kind of people-oriented delivery of various government systems because various departments still tend to work in silos and they just sort of follow their own rule book," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said there needed to be better coordination among government departments.

 Épée fencer Cedric Ho won gold at the Asian Champions in Kuwait on Sunday, as he steps up preparations for a first Olympics appearance in Paris this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an all-Hong Kong showdown for the gold medal, Ho edged out fellow SAR fencer Ng Ho-tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a final bout that swung one way then the next, Ho came out on top 15-14 to capture his first gold medal at an Asian Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng's silver also represented his best-ever result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the semi-finals, Ho earned a hard-fought victory over Kazakhstan's Yerlik Sertay. After falling behind early in the bout, he won four points in a row to build a lead he would not surrender – eventually winning 15-13. Ng, meanwhile, defeated Japan's world number 20 Akira Komata 10-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will be representing the SAR at the upcoming Paris Olympics.

    South Korea's Amy Yang wins Women's PGA Championship

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Amy Yang lines up a putt on hole eighteen during the final round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758734_1_20240624081847.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amy Yang of South Korea held off the field at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship for her first career major title on Sunday in Sammamish, Wash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old Yang, who arrived at Sahalee Country Club on Sunday morning with a two-shot lead through 54 holes, shot an even-par 72 to card a 7-under 281 for the week. She defeated Lilia Vu [71 Sunday], Jin Young Ko of South Korea [71] and Miyu Yamashita of Japan [73] by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang had five prior victories on the LPGA Tour, most notably at the CME Group Tour Championship last November. She twice finished as a major runner-up, at the 2012 and 2015 U.S. Women's Open tournaments. This week was her 75th start in a major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I always wanted to win a major and I came close several times, and I started doubting myself if I'm ever gonna win a major before I retire, because I've been on tour quite a while," Yang said. "I am so grateful and very, very happy to win a major."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang at one point held a seven-shot advantage over the field. Her fifth and final birdie of the day, a 4-foot birdie tap at the par-3 13th hole, put her at 10 under when the next-closest golfers stood at 3 under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a bogey at the par-4 16th, Yang landed her tee shot at the par-3 17th into the water. She made double bogey to slip to 7 under but still had plenty of cushion for the final hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all the hard work our team did together and I'm so grateful for that. All four rounds it was tough out there, but I just trusted what I prepared and I did my best all week," said Yang, who shot 70-68-71-72 during a week when only 13 players finished under par.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vu, who won last week's Meijer LPGA Classic, birdied her final hole to forge a tie with Ko for second place. Yamashita joined them with a birdie on the last hole as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vu is the No. 2 player in the world rankings and won two majors last season. She said she was not surprised Yang sailed so far ahead of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite no major on her resume before Sunday, Yang moved into sixth all-time in LPGA career earnings by taking home the US$1.56 million winner's check. (Reuters)

    England thrash USA to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Jordan took four wickets in five balls, including the third hat-trick of the T20 World Cup, as defending champions England qualified for the semi-finals with a 10-wicket thrashing of the United States in his native Barbados on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 35-year-old all-rounder, born and educated on the Caribbean island, justified his recall for this match in spectacular fashion with the remarkable figures of 4-10 in 2.5 overs as the United States were dismissed for 115.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Jos Buttler then led from the front in a blistering chase with an unbeaten 83, featuring five sixes in an over from Harmeet Singh, as his side raced to their target in a mere 9.4 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By winning so quickly, England secured a place in the last four, regardless of the outcome of Sunday's final Group Two Super Eights match between co-hosts the West Indies and South Africa in Antigua and any associated net run-rate calculations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buttler faced just 38 balls, including six fours and seven sixes, but the day belonged to Jordan, whose hat-trick was the third of this tournament, with Australia's Pat Cummins achieving the feat against both Bangladesh and Afghanistan, and the first by an England bowler in any men's T20 international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable feeling, more importantly to restrict USA and to do it in a special place like this is always nice," said Jordan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Been on a hat-trick a few times, nice to get it on target this time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buttler added: "I wanted to bring CJ back in to add a little bit of depth to the batting and we know what he is capable of with the ball. He executed it fantastically well, and a World Cup hat-trick is a great effort."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for his own form, Buttler said: "Personally it's really important I continue this into the semi-finals. I have been feeling good all year, I feel I am hitting the ball well and it is nice to get that confidence." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Monday said all of the displays are working normally at Hong Kong International Airport, after a computer glitch on Sunday caused displays, the airport's website, and the MyHKG app to stop updating real-time flight information.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said all the flight information display screens - including those in the departure halls, arrival halls, boarding gates and baggage reclaim halls - were operating normally. It said there had been a thorough check-up in the early hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority also said its website and the MyHKG app were operating normally and were providing real-time flight information. It said flights continue to operate normally but it was advising passengers to refer to the latest flight information and to allow sufficient time to check in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, Ricky Leung, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack.

    Germany survive Euro 2024 scare, Scotland knocked out

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany survived a scare to finish top of Group A at Euro 2024 as Niclas Fuellkrug's stoppage-time goal rescued a 1-1 draw against Switzerland, while Scotland were eliminated after a last-gasp 1-0 defeat against Hungary whose striker Barnabas Varga suffered a sickening injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dan Ndoye's first-half goal in Frankfurt had put Switzerland on course to climb above hosts Germany into top spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fuellkrug's late header ensured Julian Nagelsmann's side advanced to the last 16 in pole position with seven points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Germans, who last won the Euros in 1996, will take on the Group C runners-up – currently slated to be Denmark – in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark, two points behind leaders England, play Serbia in their last group game on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany are also on track for a potential quarter-final clash with Spain, who have been among the best teams at the tournament so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland, who reached the quarter-finals at the last Euros in 2021, have now made the knockout stage in six successive major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Group A runners-up with five points, the Swiss will face the second-placed team in Group B in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Stuttgart, Scotland were unable to secure the victory that would likely have taken them into the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Clarke's team, who lost to Germany and drew with Switzerland in their first two games, were sunk by a goal 10 minutes into stoppage-time from Kevin Csoboth, whose clinical finish capped a rapid raid from the Hungarians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary may not secure a last 16 berth despite their victory as they have only three points from their three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four third-placed teams with the best records from the six groups will move into the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's win came at a cost as Varga was stretchered off after a sickening collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga collapsed to the pitch and was struggling to move after chasing a long cross into the area as Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn came to collect the ball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a long delay, medics took the 29-year-old from the pitch while a sheet was draped around the stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai appeared to be in tears as he consoled his stricken teammate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga was immediately taken to hospital after the incident where he was said to be conscious and talking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of Barnabas Varga is stable," the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hungarian national team player is currently in one of the hospitals in Stuttgart. We will inform you immediately if there is any news on his status." (AFP)

    Israel PM says 'intense' phase of Gaza war nearing end

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Benjamin Netanyahu made the comment in his first television interview since the war began. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758724_1_20240624054615.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that "intense" fighting against Hamas militants in the southern Gaza city of Rafah is nearly over, more than eight months into the devastating war.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The intense phase of the fighting against Hamas is about to end," Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 14 network, without providing a clear timeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't mean that the war is about to end, but the war in its intense phase is about to end in Rafah."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have described Rafah as the last Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip, and in early May troops entered the southern city, on the besieged territory's border with Egypt, despite global alarm over the fate of Palestinian civilians sheltering there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military seized the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, a key conduit for desperately needed aid into Gaza that has remained shut since then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu's interview – his first with Israeli media since the war began with Hamas's October 7 attack – was broadcast as his defence minister arrived in Washington for talks on the Gaza war and surging cross-border tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground in Gaza City, in the north of the Palestinian territory, Israeli bombardment continued on Sunday with medics and the civil defence agency in the Hamas-ruled territory reporting deadly strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has traded daily cross-border fire with Israel's army, heightening fears of all-out war particularly over the past two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu said that "after the end of the intense phase" in the Gaza Strip, Israel would "redeploy some forces to the north... primarily for defensive purposes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's visit to Washington, which he said would include meetings that are "critical to this war," follows public statements by Netanyahu concerning US military aid which have added strains to ties with the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has accused Israel's close ally and biggest military supplier of freezing some arms and ammunition deliveries during the war, which US officials have strongly rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he prepared to depart for Washington, Gallant said: "Our ties with the United States are more important than ever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, who has faced growing pressure from Israeli demonstrators demanding a deal to free hostages still held in Gaza, said he would not agree to any deal that includes a permanent ceasefire – one of Hamas's key demands in stalled mediation efforts for a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal is to return the kidnapped and uproot the Hamas regime in Gaza," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about post-war scenarios for Gaza, Netanyahu said it was "clear" that Israel would maintain "military control in the foreseeable future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also want to create a civilian administration, if possible with local Palestinians" and regional backing "to manage humanitarian supply and later on civilian affairs in the Strip," Netanyahu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar proposals Netanyahu had presented to his ministers in February were swiftly rejected by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and prompted US warnings against the "Israeli reoccupation of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two members of Netanyahu's war cabinet, former military chiefs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, left the government earlier this month over the lack of post-war plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, Israeli forces kept striking targets and battling Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza City, medics at Al-Ahli hospital said that at least five people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a facility of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its jets struck militants who "operated from within buildings that previously served as an UNRWA headquarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from UNRWA, whose facilities have come under attack before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some UNRWA buildings have been turned into shelters for displaced Palestinians during the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An early morning air raid on a family home elsewhere in Gaza City killed at least seven people, the civil defence agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, Gaza's health ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This war must stop," said Umm Siraj al-Balawi, struggling to survive in a makeshift shelter amid a field of rubble, with strung-up sheets protecting her young children from the blazing sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the needs, "delivery of any meaningful humanitarian assistance inside Gaza has become almost impossible and the very fabric of civil society is unravelling," the European Union said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the war has raged on, Israeli protesters have taken to the streets week after week demanding greater efforts to bring home the remaining hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Sunday interview, Netanyahu said that if his rule ends, "a left-wing government will... establish a Palestinian state," dubbing it a threat to "our existence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had targeted military positions in northern Israel with attack drones, after an Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon killed the commander of another armed group, Jamaa Islamiya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Israeli military said plans for a Lebanon offensive had been approved, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah responded that no part of Israel would be spared in the event of a full-scale war. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia said on Sunday that more than 1,300 faithful died during the hajj pilgrimage which took place during intense heat, and that most of the deceased did not have official permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83 percent being unauthorised to perform hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort," the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tally last week, based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries' responses, put the toll at more than 1,100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arab diplomats said that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths – 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riyadh had not publicly commented on the deaths or provided its own toll until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, a senior Saudi official gave a partial toll of 577 deaths for the two busiest days of hajj: June 15, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and June 16, when they participated in the "stoning of the devil" ritual in Mina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official also defended Riyadh's response, saying: "The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgement on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi health minister, Fahd Al-Jalajel, on Sunday described management of the hajj this year as "successful," SPA reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the health system "provided more than 465,000 specialised treatment services, including 141,000 services to those who didn't obtain official authorisation to perform hajj," according to SPA, which summarised an interview he gave to the state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims with the means must complete at least once in their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi officials have said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar number to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures in Mecca this year climbed as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licences and referred their managers to the public prosecutor over illegal pilgrimages to Mecca, Egypt's cabinet said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the rise in the number of deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which "organised the hajj programmes using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca" via official channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many to attempt the hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught. (AFP)

    Kenya's Ruto ready for 'conversation' with protesters

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758715_1_20240624022807.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenya's President William Ruto said on Sunday that he was ready for "a conversation" with thousands of "peaceful" young protesters who held nationwide demonstrations this week to oppose proposed tax increases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Organised on social media and led largely by Gen-Z Kenyans who have livestreamed the demonstrations, the protests have caught Ruto's government off-guard, as discontent mounts over his economic policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very proud of our young people... they have stepped forward peaceful and I want to tell them we are going to engage them," Ruto said in his first public comments on the protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to have a conversation so that together we can build a greater nation," Ruto said during a church service in the Rift Valley town of Nyahururu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His characterisation of the protests as "peaceful" came after rights campaigners reported two deaths following Thursday's demonstrations in Nairobi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate response to his remarks from the protesters, who have called for a national strike on June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations were mostly peaceful, but officers fired tear gas and water cannon throughout the day to disperse protesters near parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Kenya Human Rights Commission official said on Saturday that 21-year-old Evans Kiratu was "hit by a tear gas canister" during the protests and died in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, a police watchdog said it was investigating allegations that a 29-year-old man was shot by officers in Nairobi after the demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had "documented the death... allegedly as a result of police shooting" on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several organisations, including Amnesty International Kenya, said that at least 200 people were injured in the protests in Nairobi, as thousands of people took to the streets across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following smaller-scale demonstrations in Nairobi on Tuesday, the cash-strapped government agreed to roll back several tax hikes laid out in a new bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Ruto's administration still intends to increase some taxes, defending the levies as necessary for filling its coffers and cutting reliance on external borrowing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya has a vast debt mountain, and servicing costs have ballooned due to a fall in the value of the local currency over the last two years, leaving Ruto with few options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tax hikes will pile further pressure on Kenyans, with many already struggling as the cost of living surges and well-paid jobs remain out of reach for young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said on Sunday that the annual budget included measures to tackle youth unemployment and improve access to higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I want to assure (the protesters)... is that we are concerned about their issues," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to make sure that every child has access to higher education."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the government agreed to scrap levies on bread purchases, car ownership as well as financial and mobile services, the treasury warned of a 200-billion-shilling (US$1.5-billion) shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has now targeted an increase in fuel prices and export taxes to fill the void left by the changes, a move critics say will make life more expensive in a country already saddled with high inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya is one of the most dynamic economies in East Africa but a third of its 51.5 million people live in poverty. (AFP)

    Power cut causes chaos at UK's Manchester airport

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights at the UK's third-busiest airport were being delayed or cancelled on Sunday after a major power cut, the airport operator said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Manchester Airports Group, which also operates London Stansted and the East Midlands airports, said Manchester Airport had been "affected by a major power cut in the area earlier this morning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Power has now been restored at the international airport in the north of England, but passengers due to travel from Terminals One and Two were told to "not come to the airport" as all flights were cancelled "until further notice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers for Terminal Three were told to come to the airport as normal, but were warned they "could be affected by delays."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airport operator said that while passengers already checked in were scheduled to depart as planned, the disruption meant "some baggage may not be on those flights."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work with airlines and handling partners to reunite affected passengers with their luggage as soon as possible," the group added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline Jet2 – which operates from both terminals – said that as well as cancelling dozens of flights, it was unable to load bags onto planes as the airport's baggage system remained "inoperable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airline easyJet, which operates flights from Terminal One, warned of "very long queues" for security, and said passengers could only board flights with cabin bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, some arriving flights were being diverted to other airports according to the airport statement, including London Heathrow and Birmingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some flyers took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to describe the "chaos," with one passenger saying they had been waiting for their bags after landing after midnight and another saying they were "stuck on the plane." (AFP)

    More firms to join scheme to fight cybercrimes

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758669_1_20240623143857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A scheme aimed at helping businesses fight cybercrimes is set to be expanded this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police will partner with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data to relaunch the "Bughunting" campaign that was first introduced in 2023 to help firms identify underlying cybersecurity problems. It also provides free tests to participating enterprises to identify cybersecurity loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixty companies joined the campaign last year and 197 security loopholes were identified, with 10 percent of them of severe level and around 40 percent of high risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, the number of participating firms is expected to top 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe most corporates will not have much resources to take on cybersecurity work as they have other business to take care of, therefore we hope to use resources to help corporates to deal with their cybersecurity problems," said Baron Chan, superintendent of the police Cyber Security Division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the tasks for the authorities is to collect intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been collecting intelligence from other sources to understand the overall cyber-threat landscape. In the first quarter of this year, we analysed over 2.8 million pieces of cybersecurity threat, of which 18,758 were related to attacks against Hong Kong," said Raymond Lam, chief superintendent of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau, adding that 46 percent were related to phishing and 30 percent linked to malware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first four months of this year, the number of tech-related cases stood at 10,113 – a figure similar to last year's – involving HK$1.86 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said while most of the culprits were from overseas, officers will also keep an eye out for local hacker groups.

 Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday from McLaren's pole-sitter Lando Norris to extend his lead in the world championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lewis Hamilton completed the podium at the Barcelona-Catalunya circuit for the Mercedes seven-time former champion's first podium of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The racing may be closer than the past two seasons but Verstappen always seems to pull it out of the bag when it matters most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was his 61st career win, seventh of the season, and fourth at the track he first shot onto the F1 scene as a teenager in 2016. (AFP)

    Woman mauled by wolves at French zoo fighting for life

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three wolves in a zoo outside Paris attacked a 37-year-old woman leaving her fighting for her life, a source familiar with the case and local prosecutors said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The woman was bitten "on the neck, the calf and the back" at the Thoiry zoo around 40 kilometres west of the French capital, the source said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maryvonne Caillibotte, chief prosecutor in Versailles, said the woman's life was in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman is believed to have gone out alone for a jog after spending the night with her family in a safari-style lodge at the zoo, which it advertised on its website at between 220 and 760 euros (US$235-810) per night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lodges in the wolf zone promise "silence, rest and disconnection", according to the zoo's adverts. They offer "a one-of-a-kind, very intimate experience with the arctic wolves you'll be able to see from the living room."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman "ended up in the safari zone, which is supposed to be restricted to cars. That's where she was attacked by three wolves," Caillibotte said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it was not clear "whether she made a mistake or the trail wasn't clearly marked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First responders got to the scene "very quickly," the wolves were "moved away, then returned to their area," Caillibotte siad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The source familiar with the case earlier said the woman must have got through "security systems, a trench and an electric fence supposed to keep the animals in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police are investigating the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thoiry zoo was founded in 1968 by Paul de la Panouse, owner of a local chateau that has been in his family since the 16th Century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He recalled to regional newspaper L'Independant in April how he initially stocked the zoo with a ship loaded with 120 animals brought from Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De la Panouse sold the zoo to a group of investors in 2018. (AFP)

    Nvidia signs deal to use its AI across the Middle East

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Clients of Ooredoo's data centres in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and the Maldives will get access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing tech. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758703_1_20240623214218.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia has signed a deal to deploy its artificial intelligence technology at data centres owned by Qatari telecoms group Ooredoo in five Middle Eastern countries, said Ooredoo's CEO.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agreement marks Nvidia's first large-scale launch in a region to which Washington has curbed the export of sophisticated US chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will make Ooredoo the first company in the region able to give clients of its data centres in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and the Maldives direct access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing technology, Ooredoo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Providing the technology will allow Ooredoo to better help its customers deploy generative AI applications, Nvidia's senior vice president of telecom Ronnie Vasishta said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our b2b clients, thanks to this agreement, will have access to services that probably their competitors (won't) for another 18 to 24 months," Ooredoo's CEO Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo said in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which was signed on the sidelines of the TM Forum in Copenhagen on June 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo also would not disclose exactly what type of Nvidia technology it will be installing in its data centres, saying that it depends on availability and customer demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington allows the export of some Nvidia technology to the Middle East, but curbs exports of the company's most sophisticated chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo is investing US$1 billion to boost its regional data centre capacity by 20-25 additional megawatts on top of the 40 megawatts it currently has, and plans to almost triple that by the end of the decade, Fakhroo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has carved out its data centres into a separate company following a similar move last year to create the Middle East's largest tower company in a deal with Kuwait's Zain and Dubai's TASC Towers Holding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo also has plans to carve out its undersea cables and fibre network into a separate entity, Fakhroo said. (Reuters)

 Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was headed to Washington on Sunday for "critical" talks on the Gaza war raging since October 7 and surging cross-border tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.

  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced hope for speedy progress on unfreezing US arms and ammunition deliveries from Israel's top ally which he said had dropped off sharply in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden has been at odds with Israel's veteran right-wing leader over Gaza's surging civilian death toll, but US officials have said they were not aware of what Netanyahu was referring to on the arms issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli premier on Sunday told his cabinet that "about four months ago, there was a dramatic drop in the supply of armaments arriving from the US to Israel. We got all sorts of explanations, but... the basic situation didn't change."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he voiced hope the issue would now be cleared up: "In light of what I have heard in the last day, I hope and believe that this issue will be resolved in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli forces again bombed Gaza on Sunday, a day after tens of thousands staged a protest rally in Tel Aviv against the government and to demand the return of hostages being held by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have also flared on Israel's northern border with Lebanon whose Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has traded daily cross-border fire with the army, heightening fears of all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gallant said he would "discuss developments in Gaza and Lebanon," vowing that "we are prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza, Lebanon and in additional areas."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that "our ties with the United States are more important than ever. Our meetings with US officials are critical to this war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, Israeli forces kept striking targets and battling Hamas, the Islamist militant group Israel has vowed to destroy over its October 7 attack, in a war that has devastated much of the coastal territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warplanes had struck "dozens of terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip, including military structures, terrorists and terrorist infrastructure" over the past 24 hours, a military statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Gaza war has raged on for over eight months, Israeli protesters have taken to the streets week after week demanding greater efforts to bring home the remaining hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening drew more than 150,000 people, according to the organisation Israel Democracy HQ – Hofshi B'Artzenu, which called it the biggest rally since the Gaza war began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many demonstrators voiced anger and frustration with Netanyahu and his far-right allies, accusing them of prolonging the war and putting the country's security and hostages at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many held signs reading "Crime Minister" and "Stop the War" while some lay on the ground covered in red paint to protest what they labelled the death of Israel's democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an address to the crowd, Yuval Diskin, a former head of Israel's domestic security agency Shin Bet, condemned Netanyahu as Israel's "worst prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, Gaza's health ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli siege has deprived Gaza's 2.4 million people of most drinking water, food, fuel and other essentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This war must stop," said Umm Siraj al-Balawi, surviving in a makeshift shelter amid a field of rubble, with strung-up sheets protecting her young children from the blazing sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are getting displaced from house to house, tent to tent, school to school," she said. "This is a war of displacement. It's a war of annihilation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lebanon's Hezbollah meanwhile said it had targeted a military position in northern Israel "with an attack drone" in response to the killing of a commander of the Jamaa Islamiya group in a strike on eastern Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said no one was injured in the attack on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had hours earlier published a video excerpt purporting to show locations in Israel along with their coordinates, amid heightening fears of an all-out conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said last Tuesday that a plan for a Lebanon offensive had been "approved and validated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah responded with threats that no part of Israel would be spared in the event of a full-scale war. (AFP)

 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, Starry Lee, headed to Beijing on Sunday for the upcoming National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport prior to her departure, Lee said the NPC Standing Committee would be reviewing 12 pieces of legislation at the meeting, among them draft revision to the Emergency Response Law, draft Financial Stability Law and draft Preschool Education Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that five reports would be deliberated as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said it is important for Hongkongers to be aware of changes in national laws even though laws on the mainland do not apply directly to Hong Kong, given that many people from the SAR often travel and do business there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NPC Standing Committee meeting will be held from Tuesday to Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) said real-time updates on its terminal display screens were gradually resuming on Sunday afternoon, hours after a glitch in its flight information display system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AA said no flights were cancelled but a few were delayed due to the system failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Leung, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack, and that they will later examine the system in detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will actually do more thorough checking in the rest of the time... There is no hacking activity we've identified so far. In terms of maintenance, it's mainly maintained and operated by our own in-house personnel," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA has said all airport operations were normal as it was trying to fix the glitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung said he's very concerned about the incident, and told the authority to investigate the case and submit a report to the government.
