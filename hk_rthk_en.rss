<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Being the first to do something is never easy, especially when you have the weight of an entire city on your shoulders, and Lo Wai-fung is going to do just that on Thursday with his Olympic Taekwondo debut at the age of 21.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo will be competing in the men’s under 68kg qualification contest at the Paris Olympics. This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am the first one. I am going into competition with the weight of over 100,000 Taekwondo enthusiasts in Hong Kong, so it's a mission. They all support me, whether they watch the competition on television or live. Their support is my motivation so I am very thankful for them,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since obtaining his spot at the Paris Games in May, the Taekwondo athlete has undergone training at camps overseas. Lo also watched the first day of Taekwondo action on Wednesday to observe the referees in preparation for his own match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When I first stepped into the competition venue, I was very excited but also nervous. I'm excited because I get to compete in the world’s largest sporting event. I'm also nervous because I’ve never competed in such a large-scale competition before,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There's a lot of pressure with so many spectators watching me, but I will turn that into my motivation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will first take on Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in a qualification contest at 3pm Hong Kong time on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’ve never competed against the Refugee Olympic Team representative before, but I’ve watched him fight in YouTube videos, and he is always prepared in how he combats and what technique to use when he competes. I’ve only ever watched him in videos, so I won’t know his actual speed and strength until I go up against him. I won’t underestimate him,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Lo beats Al Ghotany, he will once again face world number six Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. The Uzbek beat Lo at the same stage at the Hangzhou Asian Games, where he ended up taking gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew this opponent was famous at the time, so I didn’t think too much and just focused on combat. You need to give it your all when you step on the stage. Though I lost in the end, I did reflect on the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I asked myself if the gap with this opponent was really that big. If I work harder, I wonder if I can lessen the gap now in competition, and even win.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Grand Palais has been transformed to host the Taekwondo events, after the historic venue hosted fencing.

    US stocks finish lower as rally loses steam

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday after an early rally petered out. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765247_1_20240808055746.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday after an early rally petered out, in a sign of lingering unease after recent equity market weakness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is what happens when you have a big risk-off type of event," Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers, said of Monday's equity market plunge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's normal to see the market display uncertainty," said Sosnick, who pointed to a poorly received US Treasury bond auction as further evidence of investor angst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 38,763.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,199, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.1 percent to 16,195.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices sank more than 2.5 percent on Monday amid worries over a potential US recession and the unwinding of the so-called "carry trade" that took advantage of the weak yen prior to last week's interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many analysts expect more effects from the unwinding, extending a period of volatility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney fell 4.5 percent despite reporting better than expected earnings as investors digested commentary that a weakening of demand in the parks business "could impact the next few quarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbnb slumped 13.4 percent after reporting lower than expected profits and cautioning of "some signs of slowing demand from US guests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TripAdvisor also fell sharply after earnings, tumbling 16.7 percent. (AFP)

 China's weightlifters and swimmers were in the spotlight on day 12 of the Paris Olympics as the national team sealed a further three gold medals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were also close calls in taekwondo and the new speed climbing event, while the nation's women's hockey players extended their run in the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China now has 25 golds to sit second in the medal table behind the United States with 27. Hong Kong, China remains in 24th.

   Reigning champion Hou Zhihui produced a stunning comeback on the final attempt of the evening to retain her 49kg weightlifting title. Mihaela Cambei of Romania thought she had gold in the bag after registering 112kg in the clean and jerk, extending her advantage over Hou to 6kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With her back against the wall, Hou had to clear 117kg on her last attempt – 1kg more than her own Olympic record. She completed the clean, then, as the crowd held its breath, mustered just enough energy to execute the jerk.

    China’s Li Fabin defended his gold in the men’s 61kg weightlifting, boosting his chances with a new Olympic record in the snatch category.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Li lifted a combined 310 kg at the South Paris Arena, slightly lower than his record of 313 kg at the Tokyo Games. He successfully lifted 137kg, 140kg and 143kg in the snatch event, with the third lift setting a new Olympic best.

     That broke a two-decade stronghold by Russia, as the six-time defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the conflict with Ukraine.

      <br/>
      Sport climbing was first introduced at the Tokyo Games, where athletes had to participate in all three events – speed, bouldering and lead. The speed discipline has now become a standalone event.

       <br/>
       <br/>
       Knowing that any mistake could cost them the title, the two fighters started the final two-minute period cautiously, with the first score coming Panipak's way with just 29 seconds left, care of a head kick adjudicated by video replay. Fifteen seconds later, the Thai athlete did the same again.

  A four-time European champion, Hudson-Smith was the favourite heading into the race, after clocking the fastest time of the year just three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London 2012 winner Kirani James was also in resurgent form, running 43.78 seconds in the semi-final to lead everyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 31-year-old could only watch the podium fight in front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hudson-Smith was the first one to exit the final bend, but with the finish line within reach Hall charged into the lead and won in a personal best of 43.40 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Briton nearly lost his silver to Muzala Samukonga, the Zambian who came back only three-tenths of a second behind Hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the track, Morocco's Soufiane El Bakkali became the first man in nearly a century to win back-to-back 3,000m steeplechase gold medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The feat didn't come easy as the trio on the podium were separated by less than half a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over in the field, Jamaica's Roje Stona claimed an unlikely victory in the men's discus throw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He edged out Lithuania's Mykolas Alekna, who broke his father Virgiljus' Olympic record before Stona extended the mark further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Australia's Nina Kennedy dethroned American defending champion Katie Moon in the women's pole vault after clearing 4.90m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was 5cm higher than both Moon and Canada's Alysha Newman, who got bronze.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the centre of a gender dispute at the Paris Olympics, moved a step closer to the Olympic title when she beat Turkey's Esra Yildiz by unanimous decision in the women's featherweight semi-finals on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin, twice world champion, and Algerian boxer Imane Khelif have been in the spotlight at the Olympics over a gender row that has dominated headlines and been the subject of much discussion on social media platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, who is looking to clinch Chinese Taipei's first Olympic title in boxing, faces Poland's Julia Szeremeta in the final on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The feeling of entering the gold-medal match is one of gratitude to myself for making it this far," Lin told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin and Khelif were disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) from the 2023 World Championships in New Delhi, with the body saying in a press conference on Monday that a gender test had ruled both of them ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two boxers are competing in the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organising the boxing in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At these Games, the IOC is using boxing eligibility rules that were applied at the 2016 and 2021 Olympics which do not include gender testing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin used her longer reach to keep her Turkish opponent at bay, landing several jabs, but Yildiz would not back down and tried to break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having lost the first two rounds, the Turk went all in during the last one and landed a right hook, but it was too little, too late to turn the tide in a one-sided affair. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China claimed a second weightlifting gold of the night in dramatic fashion on Thursday morning, as reigning champion Hou Zhihui produced a stunning comeback on the final attempt of the evening to retain her 49kg title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mihaela Cambei of Romania put herself on pole position after clearing 93kg in the snatch, 4kg more than her Chinese opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cambei then thought she had gold in the bag after registering 112kg in the clean and jerk, extending her advantage over Hou to 6kg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With her back against the wall, Hou had to clear 117kg on her last attempt – 1kg more than her own Olympic record set in Tokyo three years ago – to leapfrog Cambei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed the clean, then, as the crowd held its breath, mustered just enough energy to execute the jerk, pushing the barbell high above her head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old pumped her fists in the air and let out a victorious roar as her lift was confirmed, while Cambei gracefully congratulated her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bronze went to Surodchana Khambao of Thailand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Guo Qing took silver for China in the women's 49kg taekwondo in the early hours of Thursday, losing to Panipak Wongpattanakit of Thailand in the Olympic final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guo opened strongly in the final at the Grand Palais, scoring an early head kick before conceding a penalty point, or gam-jeom, and kicks to the head and the body, losing the first round 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese athlete made more of a contest of it in the second round, scoring with a punch and a body kick but conceding two gam-jeom to take a 3-2 win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Knowing that any mistake could cost them the title, the two fighters started the final two-minute period cautiously, with the first score coming Panipak's way with just 29 seconds left, care of a head kick adjudicated by video replay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen seconds later, the Thai athlete did the same again, scoring another kick to the head care of a video ruling. Two gam-jeom late in the round put Guo on the scoreboard, but there was no way back for China's representative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's more taekwondo interest on Thursday, when Lo Wai-fung becomes the first athlete to represent Hong Kong, China in the sport. He's in men’s under 68kg action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's synchronised swimmers have made history in the pool in the early hours of Thursday, as they put on a dominant performance on the final day of competition to secure their first-ever gold medal at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The national team were already runaway leaders after the first two routines which took place in the past two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the silver medallists in Tokyo had everything to lose coming into the last performance, the acrobatic routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going last out of 10 teams, the octet of Chang Hao, Feng Yu, Wang Qianyi, Wang Ciyue, Wang Liuyi, Xiang Binxuan, Xiao Yanning and Zhang Yayi once again finished first on 283.6934 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That pushed their accumulative score to 996.1389 points, near 82 ahead of the United States and 95 in front of Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That broke a two-decade stronghold by Russia, as the six-time defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the conflict with Ukraine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team will play for a first ever Olympic gold medal after a shock 3-2 shoot-out victory against Belgium on Wednesday, following a 1-1 draw in regulation time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The national team, whose only previous medal at the Olympics came on home astroturf in 2008, looked bound for the final for much of the game, with Zou Meirong putting them ahead from a penalty corner in the 18th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belgians, who had beaten China at the group stage, put the pressure on and finally equalised a minute before the end of regulation though Emma Puvrez from another penalty corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drama was to follow in the shoot-out ... in which five players are given eight seconds to run at goal and attempt to score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen Yang saw her attempt saved, allowing the Belgians to take an early lead, but three saves by goalkeeper Ye Jiao gave China victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, who finished only fourth in their group, had already stunned Australia with a 3-2 victory in the quarter final. They'll take on the Netherlands, another giant of the sport, in the final at 2am on Saturday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands beat China 3-0 in group play, where China had also lost to the Belgians.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia won a thrilling men's team pursuit final against Britain at the National Velodrome on Wednesday to claim their first Olympic gold medal in the track highlight since 2004.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The teams were neck-and-neck throughout the 16-lap duel with Australians Oliver Bleddyn, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien always fractionally ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was still in the balance as the bell rang for the final lap but calamity struck as Britain's Ethan Hayter appeared to slip and lost momentum, sending them out of formation to allow Australia to gain sweet revenge for past defeats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just so proud of the team I'm a part of," O'Brien told reporters. "It's an absolute honour to share the track with those guys, and even more so when you come away with gold."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy, the champions from Tokyo, easily beat Denmark to take the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States won the women's team pursuit gold for the first time when they beat New Zealand in the final with Britain taking the bronze medal by beating Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World records continued to tumble earlier on day three of track action with Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen again showing why he is regarded as the best track sprinter of his generation with an incredible 200 metres flying lap to top the time sheets in qualification for the track cycling sprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Matthew Richardson initially broke the world record set by Trinidad & Tobago's Paul Nicholas in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richardson clocked 9.091 seconds to beat Nicholas's mark of 9.100 set at high altitude in Bolivia but he could not celebrate for long as the 27-year-old Lavreysen, fresh from his team sprint gold on Tuesday, clocked 9.088, averaging 79kph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lavreysen, nicknamed The Beast, is going for three golds at the Paris Games and is favourite for the sprint and keirin. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Li Fabin on Wednesday defended his Olympic gold in the men’s 61kg weightlifting, boosting his chances with a new Olympic record in the snatch category.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li lifted a combined 310 kg at the South Paris Arena, slightly lower than his record of 313 kg at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That’s 7 kg more than Thailand’s Theerapong Silachai in second place, and 12 kg more than Hampton Morris from the US who took bronze and holds the world record for the clean and jerk category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li successfully lifted 137kg, 140kg and 143kg in the snatch event, with the third lift setting a new Olympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31 year old's attempt to clean and jerk 172kg, to equal his own Olympic record from Tokyo, fell narrowly short, with Li buckling as the weights reached his chest. He settled for the 167kg he managed on his second attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first weightlifting gold and the 23rd gold overall for the national team at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A preseason friendly between Kitchee and Atletico Madrid ended with the visitors winning 6-1, in a game that brought smiles to the faces of local football fans with star names playing, and a lot of goals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atletico took the lead in the 6th minute with a goal from striker Alexander Sorloth, who's shot hit the left post before going in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sorloth scored again in the 7th minute straight from kickoff with a lob.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kitchee did regroup and were able to even out the competition a bit, but in the second half, there were more goals with the Spanish side's Carlos Martin tapping in from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in the 61st minute, Santiago Mourino scored Atletico's fourth goal with a header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, in the 67th minute, Kitchee scored – Sherzod Temirov smashed home with a drive inside the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the goals from Atletico kept on coming with Adrian Nino and Thomas Lemar scoring before the match ended.

  Miroslaw, who is already the world record holder, had a clean run up the 15-metre wall to beat Deng Lijuan of China in the big final for gold with a time of 6.10 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deng also had an impressive run to earn the silver medal with her personal best time of 6.18 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miroslaw’s teammate Aleksandra Kalucka secured the bronze after beating Indonesia's Rajiah Sallsabillah in the small final with a time of 6.53.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sport climbing was first introduced at the Tokyo Games, where athletes had to participate in all three events – speed, bouldering and lead – for a chance to win a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport returned to the Paris Games in a new format with speed being a standalone event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday booked semi-final places in both men's and women's team table tennis at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's national team took on South Korea in the last eight at South Paris Arena 4, a day after brushing aside India in the round of 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the opening doubles match, Ma Long and Wang Chuqin dominated the South Korean pair of Cho Dae-seong and Jang Woo-jin, winning 11-5, 11-9, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ensuing singles match, Fan Zhendong and Lim Jong-hoon split the first two games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan, who struck gold in the singles contest, then went on to win 11-9, 11-6, putting China up 2-0 in the best-of-five quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Jang then squared off in the next singles match, which went back and forth before Wang pulled through for a 3-1 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China won 3-0 and will take on France in the semi-finals on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar result in the women's draw, where Chen Meng, Wang Manyu and Sun Yingsha comfortably saw off Chinese Taipei 3-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded trio did not drop a single game against Chen Szu-Yu, Chien Tung-Chuan and Cheng I-Ching, as they move one step closer to defending their Tokyo title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They take on South Korea in the semi-finals on Thursday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 About 40 percent of students taking part in this year's Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS) on Wednesday received offers from local universities, a figure that's in line with previous years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 40,000 students joined the centralised admissions scheme, and more than 15,700 of them were given an offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong said it admitted four of the 10 top scorers in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam, as well as eight top athletes through the Top Athletes Direct Admission Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them is Chloe Pak, who holds the Hong Kong U18 and U20 records in 100m hurdles as well as the Hong Kong record in 4x200m relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pak will be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People think that studying and training may not co-exist, but I definitely do not think this is an issue, because it really depends on the person and their attitude," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese University, meanwhile, admitted five top DSE scorers who will all be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another top DSE scorer will pursue a degree in business at the University of Science and Technology.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765169_1_20240807163355.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Wednesday dismissed a carer's claim that a negative culture at the residential home she worked at led to her abusing at least 22 of the children there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu Wing-sin, 46, was one of 34 caregivers charged in connection with a spate of child abuse at the Children's Residential Home in Prince Edward three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pleaded guilty to 49 counts of abuse, with the District Court told she hit children with a shoe and kicked them in the head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as citing a negative culture at the home run by the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children, the defence said Chiu had been praised by parents and senior colleagues during her more than 20 years of experience in childcare and had suffered depression and suicidal thoughts following the abuse incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, judge Lily Wong rejected the mitigation plea and severely criticised Chiu for her actions, saying she "beat up the children every day she went to work".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge questioned why Chiu did not take action or resign from her position if she disagreed with the practices at the centre, instead of participating in the abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was adjourned until September 20 for sentencing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of people queued up on Wednesday to visit Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery before it opened at 10am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Located on the second floor of the Hong Kong Museum of History, the gallery is the city's first thematic exhibition dedicated to promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman at the front of the queue said that as a Chinese person, she should know more about national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She expressed concern about the limited sense of national identity among Hong Kong's youth compared with their mainland counterparts, and stressed the need for more education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child accompanied by his grandmother said he wanted to explore issues beyond what he had learned at school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to learn more about Chinese history and law, which we did not learn much about in school," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,100-square-metre gallery is divided into six different zones, including a theatre that shows a short video about modern Chinese history and emphasises the importance of national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has called for a wide range of visitors to the gallery.

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765141_1_20240807130622.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Wednesday announced an interim dividend due to its strong performance in the first six months of 2024, despite reporting a drop in first-half profit from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm added that a decrease in profit for its airlines and subsidiaries was "principally attributable to the normalisation of ticket prices".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group recorded a 14 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our strong performance for the first six months of the year was primarily driven by the ongoing robust demand for travel, and the solid performance of our cargo business," said the airline's chairman Patrick Healy in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This result has allowed us to announce a first interim dividend payment to ordinary shareholders of HK$0.20 per ordinary share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay's budget arm, HK Express, reported a loss of HK$73 million in the first half of the year, following earnings of HK$333 million in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said the low-cost carrier had been facing engine issues and regional competition, but he remained confident in the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of those aircraft are on ground and not being able to generate revenue for HK Express in the short term," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second issue HK Express is facing short-term, is the very keen competition among short-haul carriers based in Hong Kong, as well as the foreign low-cost carriers flying into Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Healy said the company is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic flight levels within the first quarter of 2025 as it enters "the final stretch" of its rebuilding journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are increasing our group headcount by 5,000 to a total of 29,000 people by the end of this year to support this pace of growth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline had also bought back HK$19.5 billion in preference shares acquired by the government as part of a bailout package to stay afloat, and said it would continue to maintain a lower level of liquidity than it did during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of its fleet, Cathay said it would buy 30 Airbus A330-900 wide-body aircraft, with an option to purchase 30 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not disclose the purchase price but said it received "significant price concessions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The basic price is about US$11 billion, or roughly HK$85.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These new regional wide-body aircraft are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will join the Cathay Pacific fleet, principally serving destinations in Asia. We now have more than 100 new-generation aircraft in our delivery pipeline, with the rights to acquire 80 additional aircraft in future," Healy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purchase of Airbus aircraft is part of an investment drive of more than HK$100 billion over the next seven years, which also includes newly designed lounges and cabin products.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Growth in China's exports slowed last month while imports returned to the black, customs data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Exports were up 7 percent in July year on year after posting an 8.6 percent increase the month before, the strongest rise in 15 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's figure was the weakest since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of the year taken together, exports rose 6.7 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, rose at a robust 7.2 percent last month, compared with a 2.3 percent contraction in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's imports growth was the fastest in three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports climbed 5.4 percent in the January-July period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus narrowed to US$84.65 billion in July from US$99.05 billion in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, the trade surplus expanded by 7.9 percent year on year to US$518 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns remained for the world's second-largest economy after second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent from 5.3 percent in the January-March period, keeping alive calls for policymakers to roll out more support to reach the government's full-year growth target of around 5 percent.

    Govt urged to prevent misuse of healthcare vouchers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A lawmaker says the government should act as a gatekeeper to prevent potential misuse of the elderly healthcare voucher. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765112_1_20240807113008.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Wednesday urged the government to ensure proper use of public funds as the city's healthcare voucher scheme for the elderly is further expanded to include more mainland medical institutions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong residents aged 65 and above receive HK$2,000 vouchers each year to spend on private healthcare services. From next Wednesday, these vouchers will be accepted at seven facilities in the Greater Bay Area, up from four at present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca Chan, chairwoman of Legco's health services panel, said during an RTHK programme that the government should act as a gatekeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There shouldn't be any possibility of reselling the vouchers or using them for other purposes, such as just buying [medical] products.... The government needs to act as a gatekeeper, perhaps through inspections. They should also look at how to deal with reports of illegal use," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Siu, who manages a mainland service provider covered by the voucher scheme, highlighted the growing trend of Hong Kong residents, especially the elderly, seeking medical services across the border. About one in five of his clients are from Hong Kong, a number he expects to increase after the scheme is further expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the expansion could help ease the strain on Hong Kong's medical system, adding that his firm plans to hire more Cantonese-speaking staff to meet the growing demand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rower Chiu Hin-chun, a two-time SAR Olympian who made history with his performance at the Paris Games, said he wants to thank his family for supporting his career over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu was ranked 20th overall in Paris, the best result for himself and a male Hong Kong rower at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished fourth in his heat in the preliminary round at the Paris Games, and had to go through the repechage to advance to the next stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the heat, I keep asking myself if anything I can squeeze more to not get caught by the Hungarian athlete. And after that, I told myself I already gave my 100 percent in the heat so there's no regrets,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking on five Olympic races in just a week, Chiu said the biggest challenge was to recover both mentally and physically in a short period of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have to think [about] how to recover, what else I have to eat so I can recover faster. In the middle of the race, I feel very tired and [have] to adjust my [mentality] to prepare for the next race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a lightweight rower competing in the open category, he admitted it’s not easy to take on Europeans who are larger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with a bright smile, the 29-year-old said family support kept him going until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially like this time, they come to Paris and they have to walk through like the 2km courses from the start to the finish to the spectator stage to watch my race, and then go back to the start again, and to take the bus and go back to the hotel,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Normally people have their family trip [elsewhere], and our family trip is watching my race. So it is really special for us,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Formerly a windsurfer, Chiu found his place on the flat water because of the satisfaction it brought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In rowing, we have a quote, it’s ‘mileage makes champions’. So when I changed to rowing, I [was] very satisfied with my performance and also the achievements can keep pushing me to the other level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who won a World Cup gold medal in Switzerland just before Paris, will fly to Canada next for the World Rowing Championships from August 18 to 25.

 The Hong Kong market opened stronger on Wednesday, taking its cue from Wall Street, which partially rebounded from a sell-off in the previous session.

  The Hang Seng Index was up 37.44 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,684.78.

  In the United States, investors returned to the market after soothing comments by Federal Reserve officials eased US recession worries, with the S&P and the Nasdaq both gaining more than one percent, and the Dow rising 0.8 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland's Kellie Harrington has retained her Olympic title, beating China's top seed Yang Wenlu in a much-anticipated gold medal bout.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The women's 60kg showdown took place in front of a raucous crowd inside Court Phillipe Chatrier at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harrington got off to a good start, taking the first round when four of five judges ruled in her favour. Yang tried to respond but lost round two 4-1 on the cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the verge of victory, Harrington turned defensive in the final round, looking to run down the clock instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her tactic worked, as she won by a 4-1 split decision to become the first Irishwoman to win back-to-back Olympic golds. The 34-year-old amateur boxer was in tears as her victory was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the ring, Algeria's Imane Khelif remains on course for a gold medal after ousting Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand on 5-0 unanimous decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khelif, who was disqualified by the now-suspended International Boxing Association last year after failing gender tests, will take on China's Yang Liu in the women's 66kg final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang advanced after beating Chinese Taipei's Chen Nien-chin by a split decision of 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot Wu Yu also progressed to the women's 50kg gold medal bout, after the top seed defeated Kazakhstan's Nazym Kyzaibay.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday after three straight days of losses, with analysts pointing to bargain hunting and US bond markets bouncing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gains in New York also followed a quieter day in most overseas stock markets and came as Caterpillar and Uber reported solid earnings, lifting shares of both companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful that we'll get some stability back," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that there could still be "a little more downside risks to the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.8 percent at 38,997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,240, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 1.0 percent to 16,366.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices fell more than 2.5 percent on Monday in a move seen as a reflection of worries about a US recession following Friday's disappointing jobs data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market watchers have also pointed to ripple effects from Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and have led to liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei, which slumped 12.4 percent on Monday, jumped 10.2 percent on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reversal in the US equity market came as US Treasury bond yields climbed and as a closely-watched volatility index retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Caterpillar gained 3.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as strong pricing offset the hit from lower revenues. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Netherlands proved once again they only have themselves to beat, shaving fractions off their own record time not once, but twice on Tuesday evening in Paris to retain their track cycling team sprint gold medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trio of Jeffrey Hoogland, Harrie Lavreysen and Roy van den Berg edged Great Britain's Jack Carlin, Ed Lowe and Hamish Turnbull by more than eight-tenths of a second to clinch victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch threw down the gauntlet on their opponents after setting a record-breaking time of 41.191 seconds in the heat. They also owned the previous best of 41.225 seconds achieved in February 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That fresh record stood for less than an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They eclipsed the 41-second barrier with a gold-winning time of 40.949 seconds in the final. Australia denied France a podium finish in the bronze medal race earlier, while China finished seventh.

 Diving again took centre stage for Team China on day 11 of the Paris Olympics, with a teenage star of the national team clinching a second gold of the games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However the nation fell to second in the medal table behind the United States, with 22 golds to 24 for the Americans, after losing in wrestling and boxing finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No Hong Kong, China athletes were in action. The SAR remains 21st in the medal table.

          The youngest Olympian in Paris, 11-year-old Zheng Haohao from China, had a strong first run in the women's park skateboarding preliminaries, but that wasn't enough for her to advance.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Australian teenage skateboarding sensation Arisa Trew won the Olympic gold, edging out Japan's Cocona Hiraki in silver and Britain's injured Sky Brown in bronze.

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Cole Hocker delivered one of the all-time Olympic shocks when he won the 1,500 metres gold with a stunning finish to blast past world champion Josh Kerr as defending champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen faded to fourth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The race had been billed as a showdown between Ingebrigtsen and Kerr and the Norwegian set a hot pace as he led coming into the last 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briton Kerr, just as he did in last year’s world championships, surged past him and looked set for victory, only for Hocker to find a way through on the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His winning time of three minutes 27.65 was an Olympic record and a massive personal best by more than three seconds. Kerr posted a national record 3:27.79 and Yared Nuguse took bronze for the US in another huge pb of 3:27.80.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ingebrigtsen finished fourth in a time faster than his Olympic record set in Tokyo, but the double world champion over 5,000m has another shot at a medal as he goes in the heats over that distance on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Gabby Thomas finally claimed the global title she has promised for so long when she delivered a dominant performance to take Olympic 200 metres gold, denying silver medallist Julien Alfred a sprint double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, 27, took bronze in Tokyo and silver in last year’s world championships, but she was in control throughout the final, coming home in 21.83 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alfred, who claimed Saint Lucia’s first Olympic medal when she won the 100m on Saturday, was a clear second in 22.08, with Brittany Brown taking bronze for the US in 20.20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's Zhao Jie claimed bronze in the women's hammer throw, behind Camryn Rogers, who won gold for Canada, and Annette Echikunwoke of the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Miltiadis Tentoglou retained the gold medal in the men's long jump. Jamaican Wayne Pinnock took silver and Italy's Mattia Furlani claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bahrain's Winfred Yavi won the women's 3,000 metres steeplechase. Uganda's Peruth Chemutai took silver and Kenya's Faith Cherotich claimed bronze. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kenichiro Fumita becomes the first Japanese Greco-Roman wrestler to win an Olympic gold in four decades. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765065_1_20240807023848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of a first-ever men's wrestling gold were dashed early on Wednesday as Cao Liguo was beaten by Japan's Kenichiro Fumita in the 60kg Greco-Roman final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile there was history in the 130kg Greco-Roman final, when Cuban wrestler Mijain Lopez became the first athlete to win five consecutive individual gold medals in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita won by a cumulative score of 4-1 over two periods, and led from start to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao requested a challenge out of desperation as time expired, but the judge ruled the result would stand and the 25-year-old Guangxi native had to settle for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zholaman Sharshenbekov of Kazakhstan and North Korean Ri Se-ung earlier took bronze in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has only two Olympic wrestling golds, with the last one coming in 2008 when Wang Jiao clinched the women's 72kg freestyle. Since then the team has racked up three silvers and four bronzes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita, meanwhile, becomes the first Japanese entrant to win a Greco-Roman gold since 1984.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 130kg final, Lopez, who turns 42 in two weeks' time, defeated Chile's Yasmani Acosta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his victory, Lopez broke a tie for four successive individual Olympic golds he shared with Carl Lewis (athletics/long jump), Michael Phelps (swimming/200m medley), Katie Ledecky (swimming/800m freestyle), Al Oerter (athletics/discus), Paul Elvstrom (sailing) and Kaori Icho (wrestling).

    Harris picks 'real deal' governor Walz as running mate

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Harris picks 'real deal' governor Walz as running mate" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765062_1_20240807021812.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris said on Tuesday she was "proud" to tap Tim Walz as her running mate, opting for the Minnesota governor with blue-collar credentials as the partner most likely to boost her historic White House bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walz had been on a vice-presidential shortlist with a string of other Democratic figures seen as broadening Harris's appeal as she sprints into the contest against Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming to make history as the first woman US president, Harris, already a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, has little time before Election Day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud to announce that I've asked Tim Walz to be my running mate," she posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden quickly expressed support for his deputy's "great decision" to choose Walz, saying the duo "will be a powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket and help win over working-class, white, male voters, a demographic that propelled Trump to victory in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner, decades of military experience and a rural perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dismisses the "nonsense" of Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance, and he is also a gun-owner who tweets about hunting, goes ice-fishing and rides rollercoasters with his daughter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The onetime teacher and school sports coach flipped a Republican district in 2006 to win a seat in the House of Representatives in a state seen as light years from the coastal elites of California, Harris's home turf, or the East Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Walz will appeal to the left for championing cannabis legalization, worker protections, abortion rights, and tighter firearm restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's campaign branded the Minnesotan as a "dangerously liberal extremist" seeking to impose California values on the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic grandee Nancy Pelosi swatted such criticism aside, telling MSNBC that Walz "is right down the middle. He's a heartland of America Democrat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz earned enthusiastic endorsements from Democratic liberals as well as centrists like Senator Joe Manchin, who called him "the real deal." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's teenage sensation Quan Hongchan comfortably defended her diving gold in the 10 metre platform, fending off teammate Chen Yuxi who took silver while Kim Mi-rae of North Korea rounded up the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That marked a second gold medal for 17-year-old Quan in Paris, having clinched the 10 metre synchronised platform title with Chen earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China remains on track for a clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Games, clinching five so far, with three more up for grabs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performing last out of the 12 finalists, Quan showed composure and led after each of the five rounds for a wire-to-wire victory. She couldn't replicate her Olympic record of 466.2 points set in Tokyo, finishing with 425.6 this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By comparison, Chen accumulated 420.7 points, and 372.1 for Kim. The North Korean clinched her country's first Olympic medal in an individual diving event.

 The youngest Olympian in Paris, 11-year-old Zheng Haohao from China, had a strong first run in the women's park skateboarding preliminaries on Tuesday, but that wasn't enough for her to advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng had an opening score of 63.19 with a clean run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she fell in her second and third runs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each competitor had three runs, and their ranking is determined by the highest score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The score of 63.19 placed Zheng 18th out of 22 athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian teenage skateboarding sensation Arisa Trew won the Olympic gold, edging out Japan's Cocona Hiraki in silver and Britain's injured Sky Brown in bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trew, 14, in her trademark pink helmet, nailed a high-risk and high-speed final round to leap to the top of the rankings, bringing some of the crowd to their feet at a sun-drenched Place de la Concorde stadium. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday urged Hongkongers planning to travel to the United Kingdom, or those who are already there, to be careful given the ongoing protests and riots there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber outbound travel alert – the lowest in a three-tier warning system – is currently in effect for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means there are signs of threat and people visiting should "monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation and asked any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or reach out to the Chinese Embassy in the UK.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's volleyball team on Tuesday crashed out of the Paris Olympics, suffering a 3-2 defeat to Turkey in a nail-biting quarter-final clash at South Paris Arena 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China, who are three-time Olympic champions, claimed the first set 25-23 before dropping the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took the fourth set to force a tie-breaker, but fell short 15-12 in the deciding fifth set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Melissa Teresa Vargas scored 42 points to lead the Turkish women to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was tied 11-all in the fifth set before a smash of Vargas and a spiking error from Wu Mengjie of China pushed Turkey up 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gong Xiangyu had a smash to pull China within 13-12, but another kill of Vargas and a smart play of Elif Sahin – who replaced injured starting setter Cansu Ozbay in the last three sets – sealed the victory for the Turkish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Vargas played a great game," said China head coach Cai Bin. "We tried our best to stop her, but could not do that well enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey next face Serbia or Italy in the semi-finals. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champions China on Tuesday eased past India in the round of 16 in men's team table tennis at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma Long and Wang Chuqin drew first blood in the opening doubles match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair rolled to an 11-2, 11-3, 11-7 victory over Harmeet Desai and Manav Vikash Thakkar of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a singles match, Fan Zhendong, who won the men's singles gold medal in Paris, dropped the opening game against Sharath Kamal Achanta 11-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan then came to life, taking the next three games 11-7, 11-7, 11-5 to seal victory.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Tuesday called for improvements to public facilities for breastfeeding.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The body said a survey of 1,000 breastfeeding mothers found 81 percent were unhappy with the facilities available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Complaints included an insufficient number of babycare and lactation rooms, and small sizes and poor hygiene conditions when it comes to some of those that are available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The conditions of these facilities will directly affect whether women choose to breastfeed or express milk in public places, and may even become barriers to breastfeeding," said EOC Executive Director Ferrick Chu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 90 percent of the survey respondents said they thought shopping centres should provide more breastfeeding or expressing facilities, while over 80 percent thought commercial and government premises should improve the hygiene standards of their facilities, the EOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission said the government should ensure an even distribution of breastfeeding facilities across different areas of the city and provide incentives for premises to establish and maintain high-quality facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Breastfeeding is not just a mother's responsibility, it also affects the growth and development of the next generation. All sectors of society have a duty to create a favourable environment for breastfeeding mothers," said EOC Chairwoman Linda Lam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Tuesday called on Hong Kong's business sector to make proactive efforts to understand, respond and embrace changes, during a session studying a letter by President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a recent reply letter to Hong Kong entrepreneurs with family ties to Ningbo, Xi urged them to leverage their strengths and contribute to Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, was quoted as saying that society, especially the business sector, should take the president's words as a guide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, who heads Beijing's liaison office in the SAR, noted that the letter was not only an encouragement for the entrepreneurs, but also expressed Xi's high hopes for the entire business community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR should act as the protagonist, actively participating in the torrent of further comprehensively deepening reforms. It should not be a bystander, but be someone who's involved," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong should fully grasp areas that should be maintained and remain unchanged, areas that should be changed, and areas where it should take the lead in making a change."

 Citybus on Tuesday announced an across-the-board pay rise of 3.6 per cent for all employees.

    China will launch satellites to rival Starlink: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carries Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764990_1_20240806155559.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A state-owned enterprise is close to launching the first batch of satellites for a megaconstellation designed to rival US company Space X's Starlink's near-global internet network, a mainland newspaper has reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A successful launch would mark an important step in Beijing's strategic goal of creating its own version of Starlink, a growing commercial broadband constellation that has about 5,500 satellites in space and is used by consumers, companies and government agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The launch, led by Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), will take place at Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre, one of the nation's main satellite and missile launch centres, located in the northern province of Shanxi, the China Securities Journal reported on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The launch is part of SSST's "Thousand Sails Constellation" plan, also known as the "G60 Starlink Plan", which began last year and aims to deploy more than 15,000 low Earth orbit (Leo) satellites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo satellites usually operate at altitudes of 300km to 2,000km from the Earth's surface and have the advantage of being cheaper and providing more efficient transmission than satellites at higher orbits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starlink, operated by billionaire Elon Musk, has tens of thousands of users in the United States so far and plans to add tens of thousands more satellites to its system, which is the largest of its kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SSST's "Thousand Sails constellation" is one of three "ten-thousand star constellation" plans China is hoping will allow it to close the gap with SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SSST's plan is to launch 108 satellites this year, 648 satellites by the end of 2025, provide a "global network coverage" by 2027, and get to 15,000 satellites deployed before 2030. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislator and Chinese medicine professor Chan Wing-kwong on Tuesday welcomed reports that the voluntary health insurance scheme will be extended to cover services at the city's first Chinese medicine hospital, saying it would be a significant step by the government to further recognise traditional Chinese medicine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine-storey hospital in Tseung Kwan O is due to open next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Chan said both Chinese and Western medicine hospitals should be treated equally by insurance companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a hospital - whether it specialises in Chinese medicine or Western medicine - the cost of services is essentially the same. From hospital beds to nursing care and other essential services, the cost is comparable. Therefore, insurance companies should expand their coverage to include these healthcare services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, who is the general manager of China Taiping Insurance Company, said the industry needs to know more about what kind of medical services the new hospital will provide and how much it will charge before deciding on insurance premiums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By then, we will have more data to consider how to calculate premiums in the future if we want to extend the voluntary health insurance to cover traditional Chinese medicine services at the hospital," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An opening ceremony was held on Tuesday for Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery, with Chief Executive John Lee calling for a wide range of visitors to the attraction.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gallery, at the Hong Kong Museum of History, will open to the public on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said he hopes various groups of people will visit, including groups from primary and secondary schools and youth organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the crucial role of such visits in effectively promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE stressed that safeguarding national security is a responsibility of the SAR government. He reiterated the government's commitment to accurately and fully upholding the One Country, Two Systems principle, while safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Safeguarding national security is always a work in progress. There is no completion. Given the ever-changing international situation, it is necessary to maintain a sense of crisis," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, described the gallery as a place to help citizens better understand national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The opening of the National Security Exhibition Gallery will further consolidate the consensus that security brings prosperity, and cultivate the grounds for safeguarding national security," he said.

 SAR star swimmer Siobhan Haughey has returned to Hong Kong after winning two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters at the airport that she needs to recharge her batteries before returning to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to take a break first, and then I'll start training afterwards, because my next competition will be the World Cup in mid-October, so a short break just to process everything that happened and enjoy some down time," Haughey said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what she thinks about being the Hong Kong athlete with the most number of Olympic medals, Haughey said she is honoured to represent the city and bring glory to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I enjoyed this Olympics so much and I have done my best in the competition. The process is much more important than the outcome, I have no regrets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said the atmosphere in Paris was much better than the Covid-era Tokyo 2021 Olympics as there was an audience in the arena this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents and fans can watch my competitions inside the venue... and there are people from Hong Kong everywhere. It feels like we are celebrating the Olympics together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swimmer said she has no exact plans on how to spend her HK$3 million prize money, but wishes to do something to thank her team for supporting her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey also called for more resources to be allocated to swimming, to enable more young people to reach higher levels in the sport.

 Another world record was broken at the Stade de France as Olympians battled it out on the track and field at the Olympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There was also more gold for China in men's shooting and gymnastics while American superstar Simone Biles saw her bid for more Olympic glory stumble on the balance beam and floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China leads the medals table with 21 golds with the United States close behind in second place with 20. Australia rise to third in the table with 13 golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's what happened on Day 10:

   <br/>
   Two rare errors proved costly for Simone Biles, as the US gymnastics superstar failed to add to her golden haul at the Paris Olympics on Day 10.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Widely considered one of the greatest gymnasts in history, Biles was bidding to add to her Paris collection of three golds in the balance beam and floor finals at the Bercy Arena.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she slipped off the beam while walking backwards in her routine, the unusual error gifting gold to Italy's Alice D'Amato.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the floor exercise final, two landing hiccups sent her into silver behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, she leaves Paris with three golds and one silver, with a career total of 11 Olympic medals.

    China's Zou Jingyuan produced a commanding performance on the parallel bars to successfully defend his Olympic title at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Zou, only the second ever back-to-back Olympic champion on the apparatus, was joined on the podium by Ukraine's Illia Kovtun in silver, with Japan's Shinnosuke Oka claiming bronze.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oka would later go on to add the horizontal bar gold to his team and all-around titles he won earlier in Paris.

     Veteran sharpshooter Li Yuehong claimed his maiden gold medal in his third Olympic appearance with victory in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 34-year-old world-record holder made 32 hits in the final to secure China's fifth shooting gold in Paris.

     South Korea's Cho Yeong-jae won silver, scoring 25, while Li's compatriot Wang Xinjie took bronze.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Reigning world champion An, who has held the number one ranking for the past year, beat her sixth-seeded opponent 21-13, 21-16 at a lively La Chapelle Arena.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the men's singles final, Denmark's Viktor Axelsen retained his Olympic badminton title, demolishing Thailand's world champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn to claim gold.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's table tennis team of Doo Hoi-kem, Lee Ho-ching and Zhu Chengzhu was unable to advance to the next stage of the women's team competition, losing 3-2 to Sweden in the round of 16.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first three matches between the teams went the distance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s Filippa Bergand and Christina Kallberg won the first two games in the first match 11-9, 11-5. The SAR pair of Doo and Lee made a strong comeback and won the next three games 11-9, 11-4 and 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhu Chengzhu took on Sweden’s Linda Bergstrom in the second match. After a tight back and forth, Bergstrom ultimately came out victorious to bring an overall tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo played against Kallberg in the third match and won the first two games 11-5, before losing the next three to the Sweden player 8-11 and 3-11 and 10-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fourth match, Zhu dominated the three games 11-8, 11-4 and 11-6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee lost 5-11, 6-11, and 10-12 in the final and decisive match against Bergstrom, bringing their Olympic journey to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo took responsibility for the loss, saying she let Kallberg back in the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel I share a bigger responsibility for the defeat because I dropped the third match, it's what led to a loss for the team," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, said she felt the team had no regrets because they had done their best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added she had played Bergstrom before and had a tough time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the first two games against her [this time], it seems I couldn't really find good ways to make a breakthrough," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, when I found a way in the third game, it was too late. My in-game adjustments weren't bold enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR women’s table tennis team took home bronze in the Tokyo Games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered a bruising rout on Monday, extending a pullback attributed to economic unease and fallout from recent lurches in overseas financial markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the Dow Jones losing 2.6 percent, or more than 1,000 points, to finish at 38,703.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 3.0 percent to end at 5,186, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent to 16,200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses followed down days last Thursday and Friday on the heels of poor US employment data and a negative survey from manufacturers that sparked worries about a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seizing on that point, some market watchers have called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – perhaps even in an emergency meeting – after the central bank kept rates unchanged last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But market watchers are also focusing on the ripple effects of Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and slammed Japan's Nikkei equity market, which dove 12.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an abrupt move in a market that has a lot of tentacles," Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said of the Japan currency shift, which is believed to have led to speedy liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan believes the Japan currency movements are much more a factor in the turbulence than recession fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survey results of services companies by the Institute for Supply Management showed stronger than expected growth, boosting US Treasury bond yields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts at High Frequency Economics called the report "a refreshingly stronger-than-expected outcome" that helps to counter the gloom from last week's economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether it will turn around the US equity sell-off is to be determined, of course," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet dropped 4.6 percent after a US judge sided with antitrust officials who had alleged that the company operated a monopoly with its dominant search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also had a bad day, losing 4.8 percent on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had cut its stake in the tech giant. (AFP)

 Kenya's Beatrice Chebet won the gold medal in the women's Olympic 5,000 metres in a time of 14 minutes, 28.56 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands' Sifan Hassan claimed silver and Italian Nadia Battocletti took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chebet produced a thrilling sprint finish to claim the first medal for her country at the Paris Olympics.

  In the women's 800 metres final, Britain's Keely Hodgkinson delivered a command performance to win the gold medal and claim her first global title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's something that I've dreamed of so much it hasn't actually sunk in yet," Hodgkinson told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The crowd was just absolutely incredible, it felt like a home Olympics for me. It just made the moment super special and I'm super happy," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Tsige Duguma claimed silver and Kenya's Mary Moraa took bronze.
  <br/>

  On the field, the United States won another gold medal as Valarie Allman won the Olympic women's discus.

  Feng Bin of China took the silver and Croatia's Sandra Elkasevic claimed bronze.

<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham signed Germany striker Niclas Fuellkrug from Borussia Dortmund on Monday for a reported fee of £27.5 million (US$35 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug scored 16 goals in his sole season at Dortmund to help the German giants reach last season's Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old also netted twice despite starting all five matches on the bench as Germany reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A battering ram of a centre-forward, Fuellkrug is a huge fan favourite in his homeland, with many calling for him to start ahead of Arsenal's Kai Havertz at the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the Premier League is the best league in the world, and for me it is the right time to move over to England and play for a big club like West Ham," said Fuellkrug in a club statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham have been one of the busier Premier League sides during a quiet transfer window so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Crysencio Summerville and Luis Guilherme and defender Max Kilman have also joined the 2023 Europa Conference League winners for Julen Lopetegui's first season in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are delighted to have signed Niclas," said West Ham technical director Tim Steidten, who previously worked with Fuellkrug at Werder Bremen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have worked with him previously and I know what he will bring to us in terms of his physical and finishing qualities, as well as his character and mentality." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Somalis joined a demonstration on Monday against the jihadist group Al-Shabaab at the site of a deadly beachfront attack in the capital Mogadishu last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A suicide bomber and gunmen attacked the popular Lido Beach on Friday evening, killing 37 people and wounding scores more, in one of the deadliest strikes in the East African country in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We came here to Lido Beach to show we can't be intimidated," said one of the protesters, Abdisalam Ahmed Abdullahi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mogadishu people are not afraid of Kharijite enemy," he said, using a government term for the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants who have carried out numerous attacks in the predominantly Muslim country for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survivors of Friday's assault described how following an explosion, gunmen stormed onto the beach intending to "kill everyone they could," with graphic video shared online showing bloodied bodies on the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Shabaab has been waging a bloody insurgency against Somalia's fragile federal government for more than 17 years and has previously targeted the Lido beach area, which is popular with business people and government members as well as ordinary Somalis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Somali people in general, and those in Mogadishu particularly, need to unite in fighting against the enemy," said Livestock Minister Hassan Hussein, one of several government officials who joined the rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described Al-Shabaab militants as "bedbugs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amina Ibrahim Halane said she joined the rally to show sympathy for the victims of Friday's attack, saying they were simply "innocent men... enjoying their city." (AFP)

    HK's Nicholas Halliday ends maiden Olympic run

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China sailor Nicholas Halliday has been eliminated from men’s dinghy competition, with two races cancelled on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The last races were scrapped due to a lack of wind in Marseille, meaning Halliday had no chance to make the top 10 to enter the medal race on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR sailor ranked 24th out of 43 participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday was on 136 net points, compared with 99 for Ireland’s Finn Lynch in 10th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday said it was a shame the races got cancelled because he was feeling good to go, but overall he was satisfied with his Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, but it was really exciting," he told RTHK in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I'm satisfied. I mean I gave it my all, I left no stones unturned, so I'm happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday added he's already setting his sights on qualifying for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Debby landed in Florida on Monday bringing high winds, pouring rain – and 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than US$1 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Debby, which hit the state's northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, washed the trove of drugs ashore along Florida's southernmost tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane Debby blew 25 packages of cocaine onto a beach in the Florida Keys," US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The load of drugs, which Briggs reported was valued at more than US$1 million, was discovered by a good Samaritan who contacted the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July of 2023, the mayor of Tampa, Florida similarly discovered 31.7 kilogrammes of cocaine that had been washed ashore in the Florida Keys, while enjoying a vacation day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to bringing cocaine, Debby has killed one person, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, and could produce life-threatening storm surges as well as catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Keys, a string of islands stretching off the state's southern tip, are located in close proximity to a number of Caribbean countries that serve as a transit hub for cocaine being trafficked from South America to Europe and North America, including into Florida. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark's Viktor Axelsen successfully defended his Olympic badminton title on Monday, demolishing Thailand's world champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn in the men's singles final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Backed by a vocal crowd of Danish fans at La Chapelle Arena, the second-seeded Axelsen battled past his eighth-seeded opponent 21-11, 21-11 in 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitidsarn's silver was Thailand's first-ever Olympic medal in badminton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia took bronze after beating India's Lakshya Sen 13-21, 21-16, 21-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lanky Dane became the first man to retain his Olympic men's singles title since Chinese legend Lin Dan, who won in 2008 and 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Axelsen brushed aside suggestions that he had reached the same level as the Chinese player, calling him the greatest of all time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me he (Lin) is the GOAT and I'm just very happy and proud to be, in Olympic terms, on the same level," Axlesen said of Lin, who was also present in the arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in my eyes, he stands as the best ever." (Agencies)

    Gaza officials bury 80 corpses handed over by Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764883_1_20240805233236.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We received 80 bodies inside 15 bags, with more than four martyrs in each bag, each wrapped in a single shroud", said Civil Defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Suleiman said Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not know if they are martyrs (killed in Gaza) or prisoners from (Israel's) jails," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video released by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, men in hazmat suits could be seen inspecting the corpses, before unloading them from the shipping container they had arrived in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The footage then showed the bodies being laid in a line for burial in a mass grave dug in the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were later buried at the Turkish cemetery, near Khan Younis, the main city in the southern part of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salwa Karaz, a displaced woman from Gaza City in the north, said that she had gone to the Turkish cemetery hoping to find her 32-year-old son Marwan, who went missing in January. He left behind an eight-month-old son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we learned that 80 bodies had been handed over, we came to search in hopes of finding him among them", said the 59-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of now, we have not learned anything," she lamented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will try to identify him through his clothes. He was wearing brown pants, a navy blue shirt, a black jacket, and beige boots."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She last saw him leaving on his bicycle from their shelter in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Hamas said Israel's delivery of bodies without identities "exacerbates the suffering of the families of martyrs and the missing, who seek to know the fate of their abducted children or to bury their martyrs in a dignified manner."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Hamas government sources said Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were then buried in Gaza, the sources added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to Gaza's health ministry which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rebeca Andrade of Brazil got the better of American Simone Biles in the women’s floor exercise final on Monday, bringing the artistic gymnastics competition to an end at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andrade brought flair to her routine at the Bercy Arena, as she executed every move with precision to earn a difficulty score of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.266, to bring the total to 14.166.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the Brazilian's first gold medal in Paris after she won two silvers in the all-around and vault and a bronze in the team event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who was the floor champion in Rio in 2016, brought the highest difficulty of 6.900 to the competition with skills named after her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed her routine with incredible height and technique, but she stepped out of bounds which led to a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles ended up with a final score of 14.133 to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old finished the Paris Games with three golds and one silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles’ teammate Jordan Chiles was the final performer of the competition, and was fifth after her routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her score was bumped to a 13.766 after an inquiry, beating out Ana Barbosu of Romania for the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Ou Yushan finished eighth of the nine competitors with a score of 13.000.

 Shinnosuke Oka of Japan has captured his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics, winning the horizontal bar final on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka executed a clean routine to come away with a score of 14.533.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a difficulty of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.633.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia’s Angel Barajas also had a score of 14.533 but had to settle for silver because Oka had a higher execution mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both were competing in their first Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the fourth medal in Paris for Oka, who has already won gold in the team event and the all-around as well as a bronze in the parallel bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Zhang Boheng and Tang Chia-hung of Chinese Taipei shared the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang, also a first-time Olympian, completed his routine with clean technique and execution, but the 24-year-old wasn’t able to stick his dismount, falling forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a 13.966 with a difficulty of 6.500 and execution of 7.466.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had a small fall in the middle of his routine, but the rest of his technique was able to pull him to a 13.966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The horizontal bar final saw its share of errors and falls, including China’s Su Weide who was unable to land on his feet, leaning forward to catch himself with his hands. He finished in fifth place.
