<div class="itemFullText">
 Jurgen Klopp said he was "not in the mood" to discuss Liverpool's Premier League title chances after a 2-2 draw at West Ham on Saturday effectively snuffed out their hopes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just weeks ago Liverpool were on course for a quadruple of trophies but Klopp's final season at Anfield is fizzling out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest blow came at the London Stadium, where the visitors realistically had to win to have any chance of staying in the hunt alongside Arsenal and Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A goal from Andy Robertson and an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola put Liverpool 2-1 in front but Michail Antonio powered a header past Allison Becker to pull David Moyes's side level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The single point leaves Liverpool third in the table on 75 points, one behind defending champions City, who have two games in hand. Leaders Arsenal are two points clear of Liverpool, with a game in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp, whose side were dumped out of the FA Cup and Europa League at the quarter-final stage, brushed aside questions about the title race in the aftermath of the disappointing draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not in the mood to talk about that to be honest or look at that at all," he told TNT Sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had to win here, we knew that, and we didn't, and now we have a little bit more time between now and the next game. We try to get the boys ready again and we will go again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German bemoaned his side's squandered chances, which have cost them dear in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we are 2-1 up we could control it, and still, as I said, in a lot of moments playing really well but the final situation we didn't take," he said. "That has been the story of the last four weeks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool were on the front foot from the start at the London Stadium but energy quickly drained out of the encounter and the atmosphere went flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta was lucky to escape punishment after a reckless early tackle on Alexis Mac Allister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The contest livened up in the closing minutes of the first period, with Luis Diaz hitting the post for the visitors after good work down the left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two minutes later Liverpool goalkeeper Allison was called into action, making a sharp save from Jarrod Bowen's deflected shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he was powerless to keep out Bowen's header from the resulting corner, which took the England forward to 16 Premier League goals this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool emerged for the second half with renewed intent and Ryan Gravenberch fired over from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were back on terms in the 48th minute when Robertson squeezed a shot past Areola at his near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gravenberch attempted a flick minutes later but the chance went begging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Angelo Ogbonna then made a crucial block as the game opened up before Trent Alexander-Arnold's shot from distance was saved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool got their noses in front in the 65th minute after Cody Gakpo's shot hit Ogbonna, Tomas Soucek and Areola on its way into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors had chances to pull further ahead but Antonio headed home a Bowen cross in the 77th-minute to level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp threw on Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez and Joe Gomez after the equaliser in a desperate search for a winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salah, who appeared to direct angry words at Klopp before he was introduced, raced forward as the clock ticked down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His pass fell behind Nunez but Harvey Elliott picked up the ball, rattling a shot off the crossbar -- Liverpool's final clear chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham, eighth in the Premier League table, face a battle in their bid to secure European football next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moyes last season delivered the club's first major trophy for 43 years but has been coy over his future. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of people protested in Australian cities on Saturday, demanding more be done to stop violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At events in Sydney and Adelaide, demonstrators carried banners saying "no excuse for abuse" and asked the government to step in and prevent violence that has claimed dozens of lives already this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese backed the protests and vowed to march at further events planned for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A woman has been killed every four days so far this year," he posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments need to do better, men need to step up and as a society, we must do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also took part in a demonstration in Sydney, and said change was desperately needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violence against women has come to the fore in Australia after a spate of high-profile murder cases and a knife attack on a Sydney mall that left five women dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, police arrested former "Home and Away" actor Orpheus Pledger, after he allegedly failed to appear in court to face charges of assaulting a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers in the advocacy group What Were You Wearing have called three days of protests from Friday to Sunday, saying "29 Women have been killed to men's violence since the start of 2024. Enough is enough." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Saturday that they had arrested a truck driver after an accident at about 4pm in which six people were injured.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said a 68-year-old man was driving a minibus along Kam Sheung Rd towards Yuen Long, when it was hit by a truck driven by a 56-year-old man.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minibus hit a lamp post and flipped on to its side, but the truck didn't stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the truck driver failed an alcohol test, and was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, drunk driving, reckless driving after a traffic accident and failure to report a traffic accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five women and a man were slightly injured and were taken to hospital.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Drivers in mainland China who trade in an old car for a newer model are eligible for a subsidy of up to 10,000 yuan (HK$10,800), the commerce ministry has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China is the world's biggest market for cars, and the most competitive in the electric vehicle sector, with more than 100 homegrown companies racing to make the clean car of the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To boost demand, Beijing is offering the subsidy to drivers who trade in an electric or hybrid vehicle registered before 2018, or a gasoline-powered car that doesn't meet certain national emissions standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who replace a vehicle purchased after 2018 will be eligible for a subsidy of 7,000 yuan, the commerce ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The measure, in force until the end of the year, applies to all purchases of new electric or hybrid vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its announcement coincides with the China Auto Show, where Chinese brands are stealing the show from foreign manufacturers struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Min Hee-jin, CEO of HYBE's sub-label Ador, attends a press conference in Seoul. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750837_1_L_20240427181538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The creative director behind the girl band NewJeans has found online fame after a tearful, profanity-laced news conference in which she slammed some of K-pop's most powerful executives.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HYBE, the South Korean agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, filed a legal complaint on Thursday against Min Hee-jin, the head of its powerhouse subsidiary label ADOR, for breach of trust in business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed an announcement three days earlier that it had launched an audit of ADOR and demanded that Min resign. HYBE's share price fell close to 10 percent after the audit was announced and closed on Friday down 4.95 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, 44, hit back in a news conference on Thursday that drew empathy online from young working men and women who compared her story with their own experiences with unreasonable and jealous bosses who either took credit for their work or failed to acknowledge it fairly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, however, said she had acted inappropriately and unprofessionally by occasionally lapsing into profanity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She denied HYBE's accusations and claimed it was trying to dismiss her unfairly after she accused another of its subsidiaries, BELIFT LAB, of imitating NewJeans with a girl group of its own called ILLIT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, speaking off the cuff and often breaking down in tears, candidly shared her frustrations for more than two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She referred to HYBE's leaders, including chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the man behind BTS, as "gaejeossi", which translates roughly to a "middle-aged or old male fool".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel betrayed by HYBE... they used me until I was no longer of use to them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The live-streamed event, during which even her lawyers appeared embarrassed, had millions of views and drew an explosive public response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parody YouTube video seen by 2.5 million viewers combined a clip of Min speaking passionately with hip-hop music. The t-shirt and baseball cap she was wearing sold out on several online platforms and many others said they had suffered similar experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women who have truly worked (hard) and experienced being undermined by men, along with the dirty side of office politics, could never speak ill of Min Hee-jin," a South Korean woman said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Moon-won, a culture critic who watched the news conference, said Min sidestepped the real allegations against her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No figure as influential as Min in the entertainment industry has ever used curse words during an official press conference, people have really never seen anything like it, so this obviously has attracted enormous attention," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As one of few successful women producers in the industry, Min has been recognised for her arresting visual imagery on numerous K-pop hits, including Girls' Generation's "Gee" and EXO's "Growl".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min said HYBE chairman Bang never congratulated her on NewJeans' debut and that the parent company had given promotional priority to another of its K-pop groups, Le Sserafim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HYBE rejected Min's accusations and urged her again to resign and stop discussing NewJeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts criticised both Min and HYBE over a scandal that has gripped much of South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  K-pop columnist Isak Choi said those involved showed "incompetence and vulgarity by not hesitating to publicly display infighting".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just because Min criticised HYBE's leadership, "it doesn't mean she is free from the rotten issues of this industry", Choi wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She cannot become the underdog simply because she is fighting with the management, especially after having gained astronomical benefits from within it." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dane Cheng says it's unrealistic for tourist numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels. Photo: Screenshot of the HOY TV programme" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750821_1_L_20240427161255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Saturday said he thinks major events like the Victoria Harbour firework and drone displays will still be a big draw for mainland visitors during the Golden Week holiday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of measures to prepare for the influx of visitors, such as allowing cross-border shuttle buses to increase service frequency and extending the operating hours of the last East Rail Line train to Lo Wu on some days. The MTR also said it would increase train services on seven rail lines, adding a total of 540 train trips during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland's Golden Week break runs between May 1 and May 5.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok this month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.

    Hamas studies Israeli ceasefire counter proposal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinian youths search the rubble of a building in Rafah. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750810_1_L_20240427135220.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it was studying on Saturday the latest Israeli counter proposal regarding a potential ceasefire in Gaza, a day after a delegation from mediator Egypt reportedly arrived in Israel in a bid to jump-start stalled negotiations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The signs of fresh truce talks came alongside ongoing Israeli preparations for a military push into Gaza's southern city of Rafah and as spillover from the war led to continued attacks across the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, the Hamas movement received the official Zionist occupation response to the movement's position, which was delivered to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators on April 13," Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas's political arm in Gaza, said in a brief statement early Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement will study this proposal, and upon completion of its study, it will submit its response."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas had previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire, something rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been unsuccessfully trying to seal a new truce deal in Gaza ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Israeli media outlets, citing unnamed officials, said Israel's war cabinet had discussed a new plan for a truce and hostage release ahead of the Egyptian delegation's visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been "noticeable progress in bringing the views of the Egyptian and Israeli delegations closer", said Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza was also on the agenda for an international summit set to kick off in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Economic Forum special meeting, scheduled to begin in Riyadh on Sunday, will include a Gaza-focused session on Monday set to feature newly appointed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions with European, American and regional counterparts on Gaza and the regional situation are planned in Riyadh," a diplomatic source said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in besieged Gaza reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight into Saturday around Rafah, the last urban centre Israeli ground forces have yet to enter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans for an Israeli incursion into the city, which military leaders say is necessary to uproot Hamas battalions, have sparked opposition among the international community due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians seeking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP on Thursday that such an operation "will undoubtedly threaten the negotiations" and show "that Israel is interested in continuing the war".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,170 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,356 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel estimates that 129 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. (AFP)

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750796_1_L_20240427112917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.

    Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister

Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750786_2_L_20240427135328.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.

    Non-plastic prices to fall as use increases: minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan (right) also said authorities must find reliable alternatives before expanding a ban on single-use plastics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750777_1_L_20240427080634.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment chief Tse Chin-wan has stressed that a ban on single-use plastics is not meant to trouble people, saying prices for alternatives will go down further when they become more common.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect on April 22, prohibiting the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse told RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme, which was broadcast on Saturday, that the policy is not intended to make people's lives more difficult but to regulate plastics at source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those disposable tableware, if you switch to the alternatives, the difference is actually very small, usually one or two cents to a maximum of 50 cents for the whole package. Therefore, it's not very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that as more and more will be used in society, the price will go down further. People's behaviour will drive the development of the alternatives, as well as drive down the price of those alternatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said authorities must find reliable substitutes before expanding the scope of scheme, as he ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic products because their use is too widespread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not going to ban the use of all plastics at once. That is not possible... We start with those which we already have readily available and mature alternatives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the postponed municipal solid waste charging scheme, the environment minister said there are proven effects of the policy in Seoul, where the amount to garbage produced was cut by 60 to 70 percent in about five to 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government pushed back the implementation of the waste charging to August, while it held trials for the scheme at more than a dozen premises this month.

    Alphabet, Microsoft power gains on Wall Street

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former tabloid publisher who squashed potentially embarrassing stories about Donald Trump was back on the witness stand on Friday being grilled by lawyers of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, has testified for four days in the trial of Trump, accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter that could have derailed his 2016 White House campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, the first witness in the blockbuster trial, has outlined under questioning from prosecutors a scheme known as "catch and kill," which involved purchasing and then burying salacious stories which could have been damaging to the real estate tycoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of engaging in "election fraud" by having his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-stakes trial requires Trump to report to the drafty Manhattan courtroom multiple times a week, restricting his time on the campaign trail less than seven months before his likely election rematch with President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in a hallway before entering court on Friday, Trump wished his wife, Melania, a happy birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It'd be nice to be with her but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, whose outlets included the National Enquirer tabloid, testified this week about a hush money payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed to have had a year-long affair with Trump that was a precursor to the Daniels saga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker explained how transfers to the tune of US$150,000 were made to "catch and kill" McDougal's story and suppress its publication, calling it a "large purchase" relative to the sums his company would normally pay for content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said payments to McDougal were disguised as services to American Media, the tabloid's parent company, to avoid violating campaign finance laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We purchased the story so it would not be published by any other organization," Pecker told the jury. "We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or hurt his campaign."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDougal's story ultimately did come out, four days before the election in a scoop from The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said Trump called him and was "very upset."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When it came to squashing Daniels' tale of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Pecker said he hesitated to pay for yet another story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not a bank," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The executive suggested to Cohen that he pay for it instead, which prosecutors say the then-Trump fixer did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The specific charge facing Trump of falsifying business records stems from his reimbursements to Cohen for the payment to Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During defence cross-examination which began on Thursday, Emil Bove, a Trump attorney sought to ruffle Pecker by noting timeline inconsistencies, while also casting the "catch and kill" tactics described by prosecutors as "business as usual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has appeared increasingly disgruntled, angry even, as the trial proceeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained on Friday that the courtroom was "freezing" and that it was "on purpose I believe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

    King Charles eases back into royal duties

<div class="itemFullText">
 British head of state King Charles III will make a limited return to public duties next week, after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by the progress of his treatment for cancer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His first engagement with Queen Camilla would be to a cancer treatment centre on Tuesday. The couple will also host Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan for a state visit in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement follows a difficult spell for the royal family after both Charles, 75, and his 42-year-old daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed that they had cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine, the wife of heir to the throne Prince William, made the shock announcement that she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy just over a month ago in a video posted to social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Announcing Charles's limited return, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said it was "too early to say" how much longer his treatment would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they noted that his medical team were "very encouraged by the progress made so far and remain positive about the king's continued recovery".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pacing of the king's programme will be carefully calibrated as his recovery continues, in close consultation with his medical team," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The king and Queen Camilla will host the Japanese royal couple at Buckingham Palace in late June, the palace said, confirming reports in the Japanese media last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese royals both attended the state funeral of Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September 2022, in their first overseas trip after the emperor's enthronement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also attended the reception the king hosted at Buckingham Palace the evening before the funeral for heads of state and official overseas guests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier state visit which had been planned for early 2020 had to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. (AFP)

    Biden 'happy to debate' Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden has branded his Republican opponent in the presidential race as a threat to democracy. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750761_1_L_20240427014751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden said on Friday he's ready to face off against his White House challenger Donald Trump in a debate ahead of their likely presidential rematch in November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Candidate debates have been important milestones in US presidential elections for decades, helping make or break voters' opinions of the contestants' personal style and demeanor as much as their policy chops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden's team has for months been non-committal about his willingness to participate in the tradition, which is usually held in front of an audience and moderated by a well-known journalist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to debate him," Biden told radio host Howard Stern Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am, somewhere. I don't know when," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ok, let's set it up!" Trump campaign advisor Chis LaCivita said on X, formerly Twitter, in response to Biden's comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presumptive Republican nominee Trump declined to face off against his primary opponents in any debates during the 2024 cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has indicated his eagerness with the man who beat him in 2020, saying on social media earlier this year that he was ready to hold a presidential debate with Biden "ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, who has branded Trump as a threat to democracy, told reporters last month that any agreement to debate the real estate mogul "depends on his behaviour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has already arranged three dates and locations for Trump and Biden to go head-to-head for the 2024 fight, at US universities throughout the country in September and October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump bashed the CPD as being biased toward Democrat Biden when in 2020 it planned to move a third and final debate to a virtual format amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump had himself shown up to the second 2020 debate against Biden only three days before testing positive for Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden at the time had said he would not participate in another in-person debate with Trump while the Republican was still ill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A verbal spar could be a useful opportunity for both the 77-year-old former president and 81-year-old current president to display stamina, as Biden is still dogged by Trump's old "Sleepy Joe" nickname -- and Trump faced online teasing when he appeared to nod off during his criminal trial in New York last week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England captain Owen Farrell will line up for a World XV when it takes on France in Bilbao on June 22, the match organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old fly-half has been in international exile since leading England to third place at last year's World Cup in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When this season finishes he will end his time at Saracens which stretches back to 2008 to join French Top 14 side Racing 92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The World XV continues to recruit world-class stars and the latest to confirm his presence in the team is England fly-half Owen Farrell," the organisers wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World XV, which will have former All Blacks coach Ian Foster at the helm, already boasts two of Farrell's former teammates for club and country, Mako Vunipola and his brother Billy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fijian flier Semi Radradra and former France half-backs Maxime Machenaud and Camille Lopez, as well as prop Tevita Tatafu, have also agreed to play for the World XV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The prospect of playing for the World XV is incredibly exciting," said Farrell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will be the first time I will have played for an invitation team such as the World XV and joining up with guys you normally line up against for club or country, such as Semi Radradra, Camille Lopez, Maxime Machenaud, in a less pressurised environment is something I am really looking forward to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am sure the players will want to get out there and play in an entertaining manner and put on an amazing spectacle for the Basque and French people to experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No doubt the French team will also bring their notorious French flair come match day too. It should be an awesome week and match in Bilbao."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The match will act as a warm-up for France, who will be missing players involved in the final four of the Top 14, ahead of their summer tour of South America, where they will play two Tests against Argentina and one against Uruguay. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paris is hosting the Summer Olympics from July 26 until August 11. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750757_1_L_20240427013512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greece on Friday handed over the Olympic flame of the 2024 Games to Paris organisers in a ceremony at the Athens marble stadium where the competition was revived nearly 130 years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hellenic Olympic Committee chairman Spyros Capralos handed the torch to Paris Olympics chief organiser Tony Estanguet at the Panathenaic Stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Estanguet said the goal for Paris was to organise "spectacular but also more responsible Games, which will contribute towards a more inclusive society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers want to ensure "that the biggest event in the world plays an accelerating role in addressing the crucial questions of our time," said Estanguet, a member of France's Athens 2004 Olympics team who won gold in the slalom canoe event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A duo of French champions, Beijing 2022 ice dance gold medallist Gabriella Papadakis and former swimmer Beatrice Hess, one of the most successful Paralympians in history, carried the flame during the final relay leg into the Panathenaic Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nana Mouskouri, the 89-year-old Greek singer with a worldwide following, performed the anthems of France and Greece at the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending the night at the French embassy in Athens, the flame on Saturday will begin its journey to France on board the 19th-century three-masted barque Belem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the ship will pass from the Corinth Canal -- a feat of 19th century engineering constructed with the contribution of French banks and engineers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belem is set to reach Marseille -- a city founded by ancient Greek colonists around 600 BCE -- on May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 1,000 vessels will accompany its approach to the harbour, local officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first torch bearer in Marseille. His sister Laure was the second torch bearer in ancient Olympia, where the flame was lit on April 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories. (AFP)

    Govt lowers Sha Tin Trunk Road estimated cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has put forward minor tweaks to the planned construction of a new road in Sha Tin in hopes of cutting the estimated cost of the project by five percent to HK$6.81 billion amid criticism of its hefty price tag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a revised funding request for the Trunk Road T4, the administration said the changes would not affect the functionality of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to concerns currently about the situation of public finances, we tried to reduce the cost of this project as much as possible," the Legco paper wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to win the support of lawmakers so that the project can be carried out in a timely manner and avoid delaying yet again the long-term development of New Territories East and the Northern Metropolis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities last month withdrew its application to the Legislative Council of more than HK$7.1 billion in funding for the planned T4 project, which connects major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River, as critics questioned whether the scheme is worth the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cut cost, the government said it will switch to using traditional materials to build noise barriers for the project, which in turn is expected to save HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will not affect the function of noise barriers. Currently, traditional materials are commonly used in other construction projects," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other changes include scrapping a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reducing the number of elevators at footbridges to further shave off around HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to discuss the revised funding request during a Finance Committee meeting next week.

    ICAC sees 30 percent jump in property management cases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday said it received 30 percent more complaints relating to the property management sector in 2023, compared to the year before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it received 236 reports, up from 182 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Corinna Wong, the ICAC’s director of community relations, said many of the reports last year were linked to repairs and maintenance contracts, with allegations that some were awarded through bribery or that they came with exaggerated price tags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complainants alleged that some property management firms took bribes from jobseekers, or fabricated duty records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said there were 51 such corruption reports in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while there may be "rotten apples" in the industry, the increase in complaints does not mean that the sector has become more corrupt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes after we investigated corruption cases, and they were widely reported by the press, members of the public may become aware of that particular case and then may come forward to report to us similar cases," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the property management sector, after the ICAC operations department discovered several cases last year, there was a slight increase in the corruption cases we received."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft watchdog said it is working with the Property Management Services Authority to offer training for companies and workers to enhance integrity standards across the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority’s vice-chairperson, Eddie Hui, noted that property management workers must now obtain a licence, and that all of them will need to receive training in areas including anti-corruption awareness starting in 2025.

 Police on Friday said they had enhanced enforcement to combat traffic violations associated with taxis, tour buses and illegal cabs at renowned tourist sites as part of preparations for the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing near the Peak Tram station in Central, Inspector Lai Cheuk-fung said during the first three months of the year, police had received 23 complaints about taxis, with grievances about over charging commonly cited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai said officers would enhance their enforcement efforts starting from Wednesday this week to May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police would also strengthen education by introducing "taxi ambassadors" to provide taxi-related information to travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from enforcement, we would like to introduce a multi-agency approach to tackle this problem. Apart from tackling the problem in Hong Kong, we would like to consolidate Hong Kong's place as an international tourist destination. And this is our ultimate goal," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, senior investigator at the Travel Industry Authority, Mark Cheng, said authorities would beef up their manpower to monitor famous tourist spots and border control points, as around 680 mainland tour groups are expected to visit Hong Kong during Golden Week.

 President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)

Police arrest 61 in dozens of online drugs cases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they arrested 61 people, including five minors, in the past month for allegedly selling drugs online.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the suspects, aged between 14 and 59, are suspected of involvement in 43 cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they seized 128 kilogrammes of drugs, including cannabis buds, cocaine and magic mushrooms, as well as electronic cigarette pods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hauls were worth about HK$38 million in total, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said drug syndicates have created channels and groups on Telegram to sell cannabis products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Syndicates imported a large amount of cannabis oil from overseas countries to Hong Kong. They then processed the cannabis oil and mixed it into chocolates, candies and cookies, and sold them on social media platforms. In terms of appearance, they looked the same as normal products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charm added that some electronic cigarette pods have been found to contain etomidate, warning that even a small amount of the controlled drug can cause death.

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarisation grows over Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Voting opened at 7am in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But turnout in the first round of voting last week dropped nearly four points to 66 percent from the last election in 2019, with speculation in Indian media that higher-than-average temperatures were to blame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second round of the poll -- conducted in phases to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country -- includes districts that have this week seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outcome of Friday’s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 970 million voters will elect 543 members from a total 28 states to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election that runs until June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes will be counted on June 4. (Agencies)

Man arrested for having firearms without a licence

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Friday said they arrested a man on suspicion of possessing firearms without a licence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers found 18 guns, 11 knives, and four daggers at a self-storage facility in Sha Tin, and arrested the 67-year-old suspect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Superintendent Cheung Ting-fung said the man had previously held licences for various types of guns, but these were revoked in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said it is suspected that all the firearms found at the storage facility this week were obtained illegally from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the case was not related to the social unrest in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, we do not have any evidence showing that the arrested person is connected to any previous riot or violent cases. We tend to believe that this arrested person is just a firearms fanatic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case will be heard at the Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts on Friday afternoon.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai was entering a new phase as the CE met with the city's mayor for a major conference on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the sixth plenary session of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Co-operation Conference, Lee said the two cities would sign 20 cooperation documents and reach consensus on 65 projects in areas such as innovation technology, industrial development, digital economy and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the first meeting in 2003, the two cities have been engaging in more frequent exchanges... Hong Kong has become one of the major export markets and also the largest source of foreign investment into Shanghai," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said these exchanges created opportunities and built a win-win situation for the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We sincerely hope that the two cities can take the opportunity of signing a new round of cooperation documents to integrate our development strategies comprehensively, create highlights for our cooperation and together push Hong Kong-Shanghai cooperation to a new phase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong Yin Zonghua, Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan, were among the other leaders and officials at the meeting.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joel Embiid shoots past New York Knicks forward Precious Achiuwa. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750641_1_L_20240426110554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid scored 50 points to power the 76ers to a vital 125-114 victory over the New York Knicks on Thursday, the Sixers clawing back a game in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 76ers had dropped the first two games of their best-of-seven first-round series at Madison Square Garden, Embiid defiantly insisting they were the "better team" and would right the ship at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made sure they did, and the Orlando Magic also bounced back in a big way after going 0-2 down against the Cavaliers in Cleveland, routing the Cavs 121-83 to trim their series deficit to one game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid posted a career playoff high, connecting on 13 of 19 shots including five of seven from three-point range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made seven of eight attempts on the way to 18 points in the third quarter, when the Sixers erased a three-point halftime deficit and pushed their lead to 13 going into the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid added eight rebounds, four assists and a blocked shot and was assessed a flagrant foul for pulling Mitchell Robinson to the court by the ankle in the first quarter – moments after Embiid had been sent crashing by Knicks forward OG Anunoby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 13 assists. Josh Hart scored 20 points but game two hero Donte DiVincenzo had just five and the 76ers will have a chance to level the series on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Orlando, Paolo Banchero scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds as the Magic clawed back to 2-1 after dropping the first two games of the Eastern Conference series in Cleveland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-point win marked the third-largest margin of victory in a playoff game in Magic history – and their first home playoff win since a 2011 first-round win over Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just wanted to come out and be aggressive," Banchero said. "Going down 3-0 is a lot different than being down 2-1. So [I] knew we had to get this game – and we've got to do it again on Saturday." (AFP)

Wang Yi meets Antony Blinken in Beijing

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks across a range of complex issues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat is due to spend several hours with Wang across closed-door meetings at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and a working lunch as the two sides try to maintain progress in ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the pair settled into their opening session, Wang told Blinken that the "great ship" of the China-US relationship had stabilised, "but negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. China’s legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken replied that "active diplomacy" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden when they met in San Francisco in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy," Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that "we’re as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China's support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese officials and state media have cast doubt over the extent of possible progress on several fronts, with a China Daily editorial saying that both sides "have been largely talking past each other".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the US; and the US side should not turn it into one," it said. (Reuters)

 Heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong on Friday with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning just after 8.30 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber signal means that heavy rain, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour, has fallen and is likely to continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned of flooding in some low-lying and poorly-drained areas, while the Labour Department told construction workers and contractors to pay attention to electrical safety in the workplace.

    Bears draft USC quarterback Williams with No. 1 pick

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Caleb Williams, poses with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750631_1_L_20240426100142.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chicago Bears drafted quarterback Caleb Williams out of the University of Southern California with the number one overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five quarterbacks went in the first 10 picks of the draft with no defensive players selected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three of the top draft picks were used to select quarterbacks, with The Washington Commanders choosing Jayden Daniels from Louisiana State University and the New England Patriots opting for North Carolina signal-caller Drake Maye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bears' choice of Williams was widely expected, with the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner seen as the answer to the franchise's long-running problem at the position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the Bears traded their quarterback Justin Fields, a first round pick in 2021, to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams began his college career at Oklahoma before switching to USC and in 37 games, with 33 starts, he threw for 9,782 yards and 93 touchdown passes with an additional 27 rushing touchdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bears provided Williams with a wide-receiver with the ninth pick opting for Washington's Rome Odunze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels played a total of 55 games in college football, beginning with Arizona State before joining LSU and in 55 games he threw for 12,750 yards and 89 touchdowns and added 3,307 rushing yards and 34 rushing touchdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Patriots were taking part in the draft without Bill Belichick as their head coach for the first time since 1999 and they will hope Maye can end their search for a quarterback to finally replace Tom Brady.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a quarterback heavy top of the draft, the Atlanta Falcons surprisingly opted for Michael Penix Jr out of Washington with the eighth pick despite recently signing a quarterback in Kirk Cousins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penix is a highly-rated quarterback but was expected to have fallen down the draft due to concerns over a series of injuries he has suffered including two anterior cruciate ligament knee injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To replace Cousins, the Minnesota Vikings moved up a place in the draft to take Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy with the 10th pick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been speculation that the New York Giants might make a move for a quarterback with their sixth pick but they opted for a wide receiver in Malik Nabers from LSU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Los Angeles Chargers took an offensive tackle in Joe Alt out of Notre Dame and the Tennessee Titans also took a player in that role, drafting Alabama's JC Latham. (AFP)

    Kim Jong-un inspects multiple-launch rockets

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Thursday inspected the test-firing of 240 mm multiple-launch rockets manufactured by a newly-established defence industry unit, the North's KCNA news agency reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report did not give further details of the unit that produced the artillery. North Korea is believed to be ramping up production of artillery amid allegations by the United States and South Korea that it is supplying Russia with weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both countries deny the allegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test firing showed the rockets met the required standards for flight characteristics and accuracy, KCNA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim said the 240 mm multiple launch rocket system, which incorporates new technology, will "bring about a strategic change in strengthening our military's artillery capabilities," according to KCNA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate report, KCNA said Kim visited the Kim Il Sung Military University, named after his grandfather and state founder, to mark the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary army, the precursor to the country's military. (Reuters)

    Trial and error needed for plastic alternatives: CEO

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of one of the companies, invited by the government to meet the media and introduce their alternatives to plastic disposable tableware, says a period of trial and error is still needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes when it came to heat, strength and storage and it was the same for their environmentally-friendly alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a point I would like to share. We all know humans have been using plastics for the last 30 years, 40 years - we have all experience," he said. "Different plastics are made for different purposes. For example, a plastic container for sandwiches is not the same formulation as a plastic container for oil or soup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said that with the introduction of new plant-fibre containers and cutlery, consumers and users needed to focus on what alternative products met their needs rather than just focusing on price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Department put on the media event as it launched the Green Tableware Platform to help people and businesses find alternatives to plastic utensils. The online platform provides a list of suppliers for the environmentally-friendly products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

    Nadal begins Madrid farewell with teen Blanch victory

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal breezed to a straight sets victory over 16-year-old Darwin Blanch to reach the Madrid Open second round on Thursday as he began his farewell appearance in the Spanish capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old said this week he was not fully fit but demolished his American opponent 6-1, 6-0 in one hour and three minutes as he continues his comeback from injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, is expecting 2024 to be his final season in tennis and this his last appearance at the Madrid Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his first competitive appearance since January at the Barcelona Open last week, where he was defeated in the second round by Alex de Minaur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian will be Nadal's second round opponent in Madrid too as the Spaniard tries to find form and fitness ahead of Rome and then the French Open, where he is the record 14-time winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am hoping to do as well as possible and I hope to be competitive against De Minaur," said Nadal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me it has always been a pleasure to play in front of you all... the support I've received here since the first time I played is hard to compare to anywhere else, so I can only say thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal broke in the second game against the overpowered and initially overawed American, ranked 1,028th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanch got on the board in the fourth game but Nadal broke again in the sixth after the youngster drove a forehand into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanch saved two break points at the start of the second set but Nadal converted the third to take further control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The merciless tennis great broke again after an entertaining rally for a 3-0 lead and once more when Blanch went long to make it 5-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal served it out, triumphing on his second match point with a powerful serve that Blanch could not control. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord's Arne Slot wants to succeed Juergen Klopp as Liverpool manager, the Dutchman said on Thursday, and he expects his club and the Premier League side to reach an agreement soon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dutch media reported on Wednesday that Liverpool had opened negotiations with the Eredivisie champions for the services of the 45-year-old Slot who is under contract with the Rotterdam club until 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing I can say about it is that the clubs are in negotiations. Then you sit in the waiting room and wait for what will come out," Slot said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It seems clear to me that I would like to go to Liverpool. Now I'm waiting to see whether the clubs reach an agreement. I'm very confident in that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The clubs have to do their job. It will undoubtedly become clear in the coming days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot was heavily linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur last year, but opted to stay at Feyenoord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been widely praised for his innovative, attacking football with Feyenoord, guiding them to the league title in 2022-23 and the KNVB Cup crown on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first season at Feyenoord, Slot led the Rotterdam club to the final of the inaugural Europa Conference League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp announced in January that he would stand down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season after a highly successful nine-year spell at the club in which they won the Champions League, Premier League, Club World Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and Super Cup. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Phil Foden celebrates scoring his first and City's second goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750604_1_L_20240426064210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Foden struck twice as Manchester City stepped up their bid for a fourth Premier League crown in a row with a ruthless 4-0 victory at Brighton & Hove Albion on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after Liverpool's title challenge suffered a huge blow with a 2-0 defeat at Everton, City kept up the pressure on leaders Arsenal with a dominant display that left them one point behind the London club with a game in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne's superb diving header put City, missing top scorer Erling Haaland due to injury, ahead in the 17th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't happen too much, does it? I think the only way I could reach it was jumping to the ball, and it goes in like a little lob, but it's obviously not something I'm really good at," De Bruyne said after netting his first headed goal in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden scored his first with a deflected free kick and Brighton defensive errors allowed Bernardo Silva to win the ball and set up the England midfielder to sweep a shot into the bottom corner before halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden, whose hat-trick led City to a 4-1 win over Aston Villa three weeks ago, became only the third player to score 50 top-flight goals under manager Pep Guardiola aged 23 or younger, after Lionel Messi and Haaland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez completed the rout midway through the second half and Brighton, who remained 11th in the table, never looked capable of launching a fightback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester City are unbeaten in 30 games in all competitions with 24 wins and six draws, making them the third English top-flight side to reach that landmark after Nottingham Forest [40 in 1978] and Manchester United [34 in 1993-94 and 33 in 1998-99].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their last loss excluding penalty shootouts was against Aston Villa in early December.

  Brighton's best chance came when City keeper Ederson gifted them a late opportunity when he raced out of his box, only to fire the ball straight at Odeluga Offiah who failed to take advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "City are one of the best teams in the world and today they played very well," Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Thursday condemned a vote by the European Parliament critical of Hong Kong’s national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said it “strongly opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for making baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smearing the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said that the SAR had a constitutional duty to safeguard national security, adding that all sovereign states had an inherent right to safeguard their security in accordance with international law and the UN charter. He noted that many other countries had also enacted national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the Parliament has demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards,” the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman noted that both the NSL and the Ordinance clearly specify that rights and freedoms under the Basic Law and international covenants are to be protected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The European Parliament neglected the relevant provisions and lashed out wantonly, fully exposing its malicious intentions," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must once again emphasise that the Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against external forces that endanger our national security, acting like a sturdier door and a more effective door lock to defend our home,” the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to stop smearing and interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China and ensure that their remarks concerning the NSL and the Ordinance are fair and just, and stop making scaremongering remarks.”

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street had a weak session, though extended trading lifted some tech giants. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750596_1_L_20240426050729.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned on Thursday and a transitional council took power with the aim of returning stability to a country where gang violence has caused chaos and misery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry's former finance minister, Michel Patrick Boisvert, will be interim prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic, this day in effect opens a view to a solution... to the multidimensional crises the country faces," Boisvert said after the formal swearing-in of the nine-person transitional council on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top police and military officials and members of the transitional council stood behind Boisvert during the ceremony, hosted at the prime minister's office known as Villa d'Accueil, which was surrounded by military and a security detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry announced last month he would resign once the council was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left Haiti in February to seek international help for police in their battles with armed and powerful gangs. But he was left stranded outside the country as the gangs threatened to completely take over the capital. Struggling to return, Henry announced his intended resignation. Boisvert had served as acting prime minister in Henry's absence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transitional government's mandate runs until February 2026, by when there are slated to be elections, and cannot be renewed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the path to getting to elections was long, and there were already tensions within the council as different factions jostled for power, said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the installation, there is still a long and rocky road ahead for the council to be able to forge a government," Da Rin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The naming of the council is also seen as key step towards the deployment of a multinational security mission. Kenya had offered to head that mission but then put it on pause as the security situation deteriorated, saying it would re-evaluate once a new government was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the multinational force to happen quickly to help tackle the "dire" situation, his spokesperson said on Thursday. (Reuters)

    Climate change wipes 10pc off wine production

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wine producers say climate change is harming grape harvests. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750585_1_L_20240426023611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World wine production dropped 10 percent last year, the biggest fall in more than six decades, because of "extreme" climate changes, the body that monitors the trade said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Extreme environmental conditions" including droughts, fires and other problems with climate were mostly to blame for the drastic fall, said the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) that covers nearly 50 wine producing countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia and Italy suffered the worst, with 26 and 23 percent drops. Spain lost more than a fifth of its production. Harvests in Chile and South Africa were down by more than 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The OIV said the global grape harvest was the worst since 1961, and worse even than its early estimates in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In further bad news for winemakers, customers drank three per cent less wine in 2023, the French-based intergovernmental body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director John Barker highlighted "drought, extreme heat and fires, as well as heavy rain causing flooding and fungal diseases across major northern and southern hemisphere wine producing regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although he said climate problems were not solely to blame for the drastic fall, "the most important challenge that the sector faces is climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that the grapevine, as a long-lived plant cultivated in often vulnerable areas, is strongly affected by climate change," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France bucked the falling harvest trend, with a four percent rise, making it by far the world's biggest wine producer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine consumption last year was however at its lowest level since 1996, confirming a fall-off over the last five years, according to the figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trend is partly due to price rises caused by inflation and a sharp fall in wine drinking in China – down a quarter.

    US top court ponders 'rule for the ages' in Trump case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters outside the US Supreme Court urge the justices to reject Trump's arguments on immunity. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750582_1_L_20240426013833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Thursday on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution and appeared poised to issue a ruling that could further delay Donald Trump's trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic case -- the last in the court's current term – has far-reaching implications for executive power and Trump's multiple legal issues as he seeks the White House again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're writing a rule for the ages," said Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of three conservative justices appointed to the nation's highest court by the former Republican president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least four, and possibly five, of the conservative justices on the nine-member court appeared to take issue with a lower court ruling that a former president does not enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution after leaving office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, told Michael Dreeben, representing Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the election conspiracy charges against Trump, that he had "concerns" with the lower court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As I read it, it says simply, 'a former president can be prosecuted because he's being prosecuted,'" Roberts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why shouldn't we either send (the case) back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sending the case back to the lower court for further review would almost certainly delay Trump's election conspiracy trial until after the November vote, when he is expected to face off once again against Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Justice Samuel Alito, another conservative, asked why – without immunity – a president won't just "pardon themselves from anything that they might have been conceivably charged with committing?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Sauer, representing Trump, told the court that "without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution there can be no presidency as we know it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office," Sauer said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Humza Yousaf announces the end of the deal with the Green Party. He's now expected to face a no confidence vote. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750581_1_L_20240426012015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Scottish Green Party will vote against Scotland's Humza Yousaf in a vote of no confidence in him as first minister, a source within the party said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yousaf's other opponents said earlier on Thursday they would seek to oust him as Scotland's leader after his Scottish National Party abandoned a coalition with the Greens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yousaf, who serves as first minister in Scotland's devolved government, ended the alliance on Thursday. The arrangement had come under strain after a decision to scrap a climate change emissions reduction target last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP has led Scotland's devolved government since 2011, but its fortunes faltered since a funding scandal and the resignation of a party leader last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party holds broadly centre-left views, but its coalition with the Greens had highlighted splits over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters on social and environmental issues beyond its core call for independence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, a YouGov poll put the main British opposition Labour Party slightly ahead of the SNP in Scotland for the first time since Scottish voters chose to remain part of the United Kingdom in an independence referendum in 2014. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Harvey Weinstein's 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned by New York's highest court, reopening the landmark case that launched the #MeToo movement and highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men accountable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a bitterly divided 4-3 decision on Thursday, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting women testify that Weinstein assaulted them, even though their accusations were not part of the charges he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined on a broad range of "loathsome" conduct, including bullying and fits of anger toward associates, that portrayed him in a "highly prejudicial" light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behaviour that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges," Judge Jenny Rivera wrote for the majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a prison in upstate Rome, New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is not expected to be freed immediately, as he also faces a separate 16-year prison term in California after being convicted there last year for the 2013 rape of an actress at a Los Angeles hotel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose predecessor Cyrus Vance brought the New York case, will decide whether to retry Weinstein.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault," Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, said in an email. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's latest Shenzhou-18 manned space mission blasted off on Thursday, with three astronauts making their way to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rocket, carrying astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the northwest province of Gansu at 8.59pm. Xinhua reported that the crew completed their docking at about 3.30am and were able to board a couple of hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Lipeng, the centre's director, declared the launch mission a complete success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Long March-2F Y18 rocket has sent Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship to the intended orbit accurately... I hereby announce that Shenzhou-18 has been launched successfully," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio will stay in orbit for six months, during which they will carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material and life science, space medicine and space technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will create an "aquarium" and raise zebrafish and algae in zero gravity, to study how the space environment affects their growth and the aquatic ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew will also cultivate plants in an experiment to help with designing crops that adapt to outer space conditions. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    'Mainland Citybus drivers may affect locals' jobs'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Unionists say they do not wish to resort to taking industrial action. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750543_1_L_20240425190732.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport unionists on Thursday spoke out against a decision by Citybus to import 20 drivers from the mainland, saying they are worried that more will come in the future and affect the jobs of local drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus said the first five of the 20 approved bus captains who arrive here next month will take a driving test before they’re allowed to start work, adding that they will only work on non-franchised routes, such as services for employees and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Motor Transport Workers General Union said it is worried that this is just the beginning, and that Citybus will bring in more non-local workers to operate on franchised routes down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, noted that the hourly salary of a mainland bus captain is slightly lower than that of a local, and expressed worries that local drivers may get a pay cut in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung Nuen-yui from the union's Citybus section said the company should offer better remuneration packages for local recruits before importing drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are new recruits, but not many of them stay in the company. This shows that there are issues with the pay, welfare, shift arrangements, working location and hours. I hope the company will solve these problems before looking into other solutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group added that it is arranging a meeting with Citybus and the authorities, and it does not wish to resort to taking industrial action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citybus, for its part, said it prioritises local workers and offers a bonus exclusively to new local employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department also said in response that it has taken into account the welfare of local drivers before allowing Citybus to import drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said the bus operator has proven that it was not able to hire suitable local drivers, adding that these imported drivers are not allowed to run franchised routes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.

<img alt="ABAC representatives conclude the council's meeting in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750512_2_L_20240425164048.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.

Manage China-US relationship 'responsibly': Blinken

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China and the United States to manage their relationship "responsibly" as he went on a charm offensive in Shanghai, ahead of talks with top central government officials in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken's visit to Shanghai has seen him sample local food, watch a basketball game and stroll along the city's famous Bund promenade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting with Chen Jining, Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, America's top diplomat said US President Joe Biden was committed to "direct and sustained" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen too stressed the need to build stable ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken on Thursday also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, where he voiced hope for more Americans to study in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the US was committed to welcoming Chinese students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also met American business leaders in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He then headed for Beijing, where he's expected to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi and possibly President Xi Jinping on Friday. (AFP & agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Thursday said they expect Lo Wu will be the busiest border crossing during the mainland's "Golden Week" holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee projected almost six million arrivals and departures for the week, with some 800,000 mainland tourists expected to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said Labour Day on May 1 is tipped to be the busiest day, with arrivals and departures reaching one million at land checkpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that between April 30 and May 5, an average of around 200,000 rail journeys a day are expected through Lo Wu, and 170,000 via Lok Ma Chau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An average of 130,000 journeys a day are expected for the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department's boundary division commander, Ng Hoi-ka, said travellers are advised to use the department's mobile app for real-time border traffic information, so they can see how busy the different checkpoints are.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on travellers to avoid crossing the border during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all travellers cross the border during the peak hours at the same time, there's bound to be some congestion and longer waiting times. So we urge everyone, if you can, please avoid the peak hours," she said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally speaking, for departures, it starts getting crowded from eight in the morning, and it'd be the busiest between 10 and 12 o'clock."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that her department has prepared for the busy week by curbing holidays for frontline officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A control centre will be set up along with other departments to monitor checkpoint operations, so officers can respond to any emergencies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The blades of the windmill on top of the Moulin Rouge cabaret, one of the most famous landmarks in Paris, collapsed during the night, firefighters on Thursday said, just months before the French capital hosts the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The letters M, O and U had also been toppled from the name spelled out on the building's facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the reason for the accident was not yet known, the Moulin Rouge's director Jean-Victor Clerico said there was no sign of "foul play", adding the cause was "obviously a technical problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No-one was hurt and there was no risk of further collapse, Paris firefighters said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. The club was founded in 1889 and the audience for its dance shows is largely made up of tourist groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of people watch the cabaret's daily shows each year, with many more stopping to look from the outside at the landmark at the foot of the Montmartre hill. (Agencies)

HK to host Fencing Foil World Cup

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will host a FIE Foil World Cup for the first time next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong leg, at AsiaWorld-Expo, will mark the last Foil World Cup of the season, with up to 400 elite foilists from 30 countries and regions coming to compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them are men's world number one Nick Itkin and women's world number one Lee Kiefer, both from the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition represents an important warm-up opportunity for homegrown Olympians Edgar Cheung and Daphne Chan before they head to Paris for the Olympics. Cheung said he's excited to fence on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot because we use to travel around the world to fence in the World Cup to compete. Now it is a good opportunity that we can fence in Hong Kong, and all the Hong Kong people can cheer for us with Cantonese, which is really touching," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's kind of like a training for me this competition to prepare for the Olympics. If I have any mistakes in physical or mental that I did not do good, I can now realise and I still have time to prepare and to be better, and even my coach can see what happens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicholas Choi, who was part of the team that won bronze at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said it's incredible for Hong Kong to host an international event and for many big names to come to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Back in my days when I was younger, there wasn't a lot of international competitions but now slowly and slowly, there are more and more happening. I think it is really good for the development, for the youngsters, and also for fencing, it's the first time for us in foil that we're actually hosting a World Cup competition, so I think it is a really big step for us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also think that we're also hosting the World Championship in two years. This would be a really good stepping stone for us to even prepare the World Championship in a better way so I think it is a really good thing for us and everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chan said she doesn't want to set specific expectations for herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this World Cup is pretty much the same as the usual ones and it just keeps my condition. There are many competitions to keep me at my best level, so I hope I can perform better on the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone in the competition is my competitor, but I just want to try my best, fence them and achieve better results."

    House Speaker heckled as protests spread on campuses

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Students at the encampment on the Columbia University campus say their protest is peaceful. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750502_1_L_20240425160736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University students heckled US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as he visited the flashpoint of nationwide student demonstrations over the Israeli war in Gaza, even as the New York school agreed to 48 more hours of negotiations to end a protest encampment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Johnson's visit, which he said was meant to support Jewish students intimidated by some anti-Israeli demonstrators, took place shortly after the university extended a deadline from Wednesday morning to Friday morning to reach an agreement to remove an encampment that has come to symbolise the campus protest movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the campus protests taking place coast to coast were met with shows of force from law enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Texas on Wednesday, state highway patrol troopers in riot gear and police on horseback broke up a protest at the University of Texas in Austin and arrested 20 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Southern California declared its campus closed and asked the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to clear a demonstration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested students who peacefully surrendered one-by-one, hours after campus police who took down an encampment were overwhelmed by protesters and requested LAPD help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demonstrations took place at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and California State Polytechnic in Humboldt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesting students have demanded universities divest assets from Israel and seek to pressure the US government to rein in Israeli strikes on Palestinian civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's fierce response followed a deadly October 7 cross-border raid by Islamist militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza enclave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The at times vulgar heckling and booing that greeted Johnson did not drown him out, though he was hard to hear because he spoke to media microphones, not through loudspeakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Columbia has allowed these lawless radicals and agitators to take over, the virus of anti-semitism has spread across other campuses," Johnson said from the steps of the university library, calling on violent protesters to be arrested and threatening to cut off federal funding to universities that fail impose order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a politically polarised country, conservatives can score points by being seen as standing up to liberal activists, many of whom say the Republican portrayals of anti-semitic violence on campus are greatly exaggerated for political purposes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson also met with Jewish students who said they were fearful to come onto the campus, citing testimony from Jewish students who said they had been spat on and seen swastikas drawn on the walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before his press conference, Johnson met with about 40 Jewish students on campus, according to students who were there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students at the encampment say their protest has been peaceful, and that outsiders not connected with their movement are behind any inflammatory confrontations off-campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We regret that there's no attention on this peaceful movement and politicians are diverting attention from the real issues," said Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student at Columbia who has been part of the negotiations with school administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Free speech advocates PEN America called the sudden escalation at the University of Texas "deeply alarming."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The administration should be doing everything in their power to keep their students safe and the campus operating, but calling the state police to disperse a peaceful protest that had barely begun does the opposite," Kristen Shahverdian, PEN's campus free speech program director, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The political reverberations reached the White House, where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden believes free speech, debate and non-discrimination are important on college campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to see this be peaceful," Jean-Pierre said in Wednesday's press briefing. "It is important that students feel safe... It should not be violent, it should not be hateful rhetoric." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Thursday said they arrested two former directors of an online household product store on suspicion of failing to supply pre-paid products to customers, a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said they had received 451 complaints against the company as of 8am on Thursday, and the complainants had made prepaid orders to the company, involving around HK$400,000 worth of household goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the customers didn't receive the products - or refunds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The online shop shut down earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs officials said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 38, on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released on bail and officers did not rule out the possibility of making more arrests.

    Non-plastic utensil firms show off their products

<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies supplying alternatives to plastic cutlery on Thursday demonstrated how their products fare, with one showing how to put its straw into a sealed drink and another attempting to cut a steak with its knife and fork.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Environmental Protection Department has launched an online platform to help people and businesses find suppliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The platform invited four suppliers to demonstrate their products to the press. One of them, Ecoinno, poured boiling water inside a container to prove it can tolerate high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its CEO, George Chen, said business has gone up by 70 percent since the disposable utensil ban took effect on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So rules and regulations are extremely important, and we believe the windows are here. So it depends on when customers want to pick things up. It's no more to replace,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The new product will allow [restaurants] to stay away from just price competition because [the non-plastic products] are sustainable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said his containers contain leak-proof materials and are 10 percent more expensive than other plastic alternatives on the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said despite this, many hotels, hospitals and schools have been placing orders because they like the high quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What are the values that they can get on it besides turnover? So this is what we are talking about. Can it, for example, be reheated? You see.. after [being heated] by 100 degrees water, it stays exactly the way that it is,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier, Supply Ching Company, demonstrated how to scoop up a portion of sticky rice with its spoon. Its founder, Alvis Yip, said his company will advise restaurants how to pick between the two types of spoon it offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have two kinds of spoon in the market now. We have the rice spoon and the soup spoon. The rice spoon is specially designed for rice because it has a straight lined design. So the [spoons] can go directly into the rice, but the soup spoon is actually designed for just holding the soup and the noodles. So to use it as a rice spoon, it will be a bit soft and weak,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Usually when the restaurant approaches us, we will gather the information of what kind of product they sell. So we will suggest the suitable cutlery for them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak. The fork snapped during two attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supplier explained that the forks are designed with detachable handles, saying this makes them weaker and more prone to breakage once the handles have been detached multiple times.
