<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that retail sales could improve in the latter part of this year on the back of a weakening Hong Kong dollar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said an expected US interest rate cut may cause the Hong Kong dollar to weaken, making the SAR a more attractive location to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said upcoming major events should also bring in more tourists, creating a better outlook for retail sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said employment income is continuing to rise, which in turn should also support consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong should also improve competitiveness through the use of technology, and this would bring in new customers and consumption to strengthen the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the economic climate will remain stable for the rest of the year if exports continue to improve, coupled with a fall in external interest rates and improvement in investment sentiment.

  "The IDF identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory. In response to these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon," the Israel Defence Forces said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 French police arrested Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov on Saturday at an airport near Paris for alleged offences related to the popular messaging app, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the officials told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had just travelled from Baku, in Azerbaijan, another source close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov was expected to appear in court on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's OFMIN, an agency tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov as the coordinating agency in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, one of the sources close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov is suspected of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enough of Telegram's impunity," said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police were on Saturday hunting for a man who, draped in a Palestinian flag, was suspected of setting fires at a synagogue in southern France and triggering an explosion that injured a police officer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the incident was being treated as a potential terror attack and "all means" were being deployed to find the perpetrator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security around Jewish sites was tightened following the attack early on Saturday at Beth Yaacov synagogue in the seaside resort of La Grande Motte, near the city of Montpellier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two cars outside the synagogue were set alight, with a gas canister then likely exploding inside one of the vehicles, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two fires were also started at the entrance of the synagogue, but were quickly put out, with two doors damaged, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officer was injured by the blast after rushing to the scene after the fires were started, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron called the incident "an act of terror", adding on X that "the fight against anti-Semitism is a daily fight".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed" to apprehend the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  La Grande Motte's mayor, Stephan Rossignol, said that CCTV had picked up images of an individual setting fire to the cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On part of the footage, seen and authenticated by AFP, a man is seen with a Palestinian flag draped around his waist, his head covered by a red Palestinian keffiyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man carried two bottles filled with a yellowish liquid. The footage also seems to show the contours of a handgun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources close to the investigation said the suspect left the scene hurriedly on foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fires and explosion come amid a heightened state of alert in France and other European countries because of the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said France's national anti-terror prosecutors had been tasked with probing the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "La Grande Motte's synagogue was the target of an attack this morning," Attal said in a post on X. "An anti-Semitic act. Once again, our Jewish fellow citizens are being targeted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called the incident "an obviously criminal act".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed to find the perpetrator".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police presence outside Jewish sites in France would be increased following the explosion, the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blast occurred during Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest that runs from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday, with many attending synagogue services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was, however, no religious service ongoing at the time of the incident, a police source said. A rabbi and four other people were inside the synagogue at the time but all were unharmed, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town of La Grande Motte has about 8,500 permanent residents but the population swells during the summer tourism season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darmanin said this month that the government had counted 887 anti-Semitic acts in France in the first half of 2024, nearly three times as many as in the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France is home to the biggest Jewish population outside Israel and the United States, and also to the largest Muslim community in the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) called the explosion "an attempt to kill Jews".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The use of a gas canister "in a car at a time when worshippers are expected to arrive at the synagogue is not simply a criminal act", CRIF president Yonathan Arfi told AFP. "This shows an intention to kill." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two veteran NASA astronauts became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767524_1_20240825014524.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two NASA astronauts who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule will need to return to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle early next year, NASA said on Saturday, deeming issues with Starliner's propulsion system too risky to carry its first crew home.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agency's decision, tapping Boeing's top space rival to return the astronauts, is one of NASA's most consequential in years. Boeing had hoped the test mission would redeem the Starliner program after years of development problems and over US$1.6 billion in budget overruns since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing is also struggling with quality issues on production of commercial planes, its most important products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Starliner's propulsion system suffered a series of glitches beginning in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS, triggering months of cascading delays. Five of its 28 thrusters failed and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare reshuffling of NASA's astronaut operations, the two astronauts are now expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission. Two of the Crew Dragon's four astronaut seats will be kept empty for Wilmore and Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will undock from the ISS without a crew and attempt to return to Earth as it would have with astronauts aboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing struggled for years to develop Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule designed to compete with Crew Dragon as a second US option for sending astronaut crews to and from Earth's orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner failed a 2019 test to launch to the ISS uncrewed, but mostly succeeded in a 2022 do-over attempt where it also encountered thruster problems. Its June mission with its first crew was required before NASA can certify the capsule for routine flights, but now Starliner's crew certification path has been upended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Starliner docked to the ISS in June, Boeing has scrambled to investigate what caused its thruster mishaps and helium leaks. The company arranged tests and simulations on Earth to gather data that it has used to try and convince NASA officials that Starliner is safe to fly the crew back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But results from that testing raised more difficult engineering questions and ultimately failed to quell NASA officials' concerns about Starliner's ability to make its crewed return trip - the most daunting and complex part of the test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NASA's decision, and Starliner's now-uncertain path to certification, will add to the crises faced by new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who started this month with the goal to rebuild the planemaker's reputation after a door panel dramatically blew off a 737 MAX passenger jet in midair in January.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United crashed to a last-gasp 2-1 defeat against Brighton and an Erling Haaland's hat-trick fired Premier League champions Manchester City to a 4-1 win against Ipswich on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's side were left shell-shocked by Joao Pedro's winner five minutes into stoppage-time at the Amex Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United fell behind to a 32nd minute goal from Danny Welbeck, who poked in Kaoru Mitoma's cross for his sixth goal in 16 appearances against his former club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo equalised for United after an hour, cutting inside for a shot that deflected in off Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Zirkzee prevented Alejandro Garnacho from putting the visitors ahead in the closing stages when the United forward touched home his team-mate's finish on the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, a close-season signing from Bologna, was in an offside position and VAR ruled out the goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left completely unmarked at the far post, Brazilian striker Pedro rubbed salt into United's wounds as he headed home from Simon Adingra's cross to ensure Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler maintained his 100 per cent start following last weekend's win at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old German is the youngest permanent manager in Premier League history after arriving from St Pauli to replace Roberto De Zerbi in the close-season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team deserved to win. These moments make memories and we have to enjoy it," Hurzeler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag added: "Both goals are very soft. As a team, we should have done better. We have to be more clinical in both boxes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City scored three times in four minutes to survive an early scare against promoted Ipswich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sammie Szmodics, signed from Blackburn in the close-season, gave Ipswich a shock lead in the seventh minute, running on to Omari Hutchinson's pass and squeezing his shot through Ederson's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City levelled when Leif Davis's 12th minute foul on Savinho conceded a penalty that Haaland dispatched with ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich keeper Arijanet Muric spent four years with City before leaving in 2022 and he returned with a gift for his old club, dwelling in possession in the 14th minute as Kevin De Bruyne stole the ball and slotted home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City made it three when the unstoppable Haaland flicked De Bruyne's deft pass past Muric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German midfielder Ilkay Gundogan came off the bench for City in the second half after rejoining his former club from Barcelona on a one-year contract on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland completed his treble in the 88th minute with a typically predatory finish for his fourth goal already this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma got back in favour with boss Ange Postecoglou as his superb strike inspired a 4-0 rout of Everton in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou picker Bissouma following a one-game suspension after posting a social media video that showed him inhaling nitrous oxide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know what it's like when you punish your child and they do everything right for the next two days?" Postecoglou had said of Bissouma's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mali international made the most of his reprieve in the 14th minute, lashing home from the edge of the area for his first league goal for Tottenham in his 52nd appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Son Heung-min doubled Tottenham's lead in the 25th minute, forcing Jordan Pickford into an embarrassing mistake as the Everton keeper was robbed by the South Korean for a simple finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero headed Tottenham's third in the 71st minute. Son bagged his second with a clinical finish six minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui earned the first win of his reign as second half goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen sealed a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Iwobi's 70th minute goal clinched Fulham's 2-1 win against Leicester at Craven Cottage after Emile Smith Rowe's first half opener for the hosts was cancelled out by Wout Faes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nottingham Forest won 1-0 at Southampton thanks to Morgan Gibbs-White's 70th minute strike.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they had arrested 11 people who allegedly used Hong Kong as a base for phone scams involving the impersonation of customer service officers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force claims the suspects, who include six Malaysian nationals, are linked to a transnational syndicate responsible for the theft of HK$61 million in over 400 scams since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrests came after officers raided four offices in San Po Kong and Kowloon Bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 20 and 67, are accused of conspiracy to defraud, using false instruments, and money laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The locals were allegedly responsible for duties, such as renting the centres and providing the syndicate with a large number of local prepaid SIM cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force seized 87 model-pool devices,15 computers and over 80,000 prepaid SIM cards in the raids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Lee Chun-man of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said surveillance cameras had been installed in the centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is believed the cameras allowed senior members of the syndicate to monitor the operation, as well as the workers' performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee pointed out that the Malaysian suspects came to Hong Kong as tourists, and were paid around HK$10,000 to HK$16,000 each month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from being responsible for using falsified identification documents or travel documents to register SIM cards, their duties also included managing the modem-pool devices by changing SIM cards in the devices around the clock, so as to ensure that the telecommunication network could be operated 24 hours a day," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said that between May and August this year, three of the Malaysian suspects had allegedly made use of computer software to modify their passports and the ID cards of others, so as to complete the real-name registration for at least 300 SIM cards.

 Ocean Park said on Saturday that its animal care team had prepared a cub-scented doll for giant panda Ying Ying, before her twin babies reunite with her.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The mother giant panda gave birth to one female and one male cub last week, and the park's team has been closely monitoring the twins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media page, the park said before reintroducing the babies to Ying Ying, she would be given a cub-scented doll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The doll can help Ying Ying stay familiar with the cub's scent, and also let the caretakers observe and evaluate Ying Ying’s behaviour when she interacts with the scented doll," it wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau on Saturday said it's not ruling out further action concerning Hong Kong's banning of aquatic products from Japan following wastewater discharges from the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In August last year, the SAR government gazetted a food safety order that banned aquatic products from 10 Japanese prefectures, after Japanese authorities released treated wastewater from the power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media, the bureau said the Japanese government had claimed that the water met international standards after being diluted and filtered, and it demanded the SAR government lift the import ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it had told the Japanese authorities that the release of wastewater was unprecedented, and there would be catastrophic consequences on marine ecology and food safety if there were any error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the government had to take precautionary measures, and it's not ruling out taking further action to safeguard the SAR's food safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the government will continue to observe the impact of the discharge, by looking at scientific data and reports by Japanese authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

 Hang Seng Bank senior advisor George Leung on Saturday said he hopes to see an upturn in the here economy now that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, looks set to begin a cycle of interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The forecasted rate cuts, I believe, will help alleviate pressure on SME [small and medium enterprise] interest payments and this will have a relatively large impact when it comes to boosting the economy," he said on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the time had come for the United States to start cutting interest rates, adding that his confidence had grown that the battle against inflation is on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he expects the Fed to announce a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, and that its benchmark interest rate may be half a percentage point lower by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed held the rate at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, at its last meeting, for the eighth time in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said most bank loans here have interest rates priced off the interbank offered rate instead of the best lending rate. He said he expected this rate to come down once the Fed had cut its benchmark interest rate.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 40-year-old man remains in police custody after trying to ram his way out of a police roadblock on Friday night in Ho Man Tin, injuring a police officer. Speaking to the press on Saturday morning, the police said the man faces seven charges, including trafficking in dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a briefing with reporters, Superintendent Tsui Suk-yee said police received a report at 7 pm of a private car driving erratically in Kowloon City and Hung Hom and that red lights had allegedly been jumped and the vehicle driven in the opposite direction to the traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 8 pm, officers found that the vehicle had come to a halt with the rest of the traffic on Princess Margaret Road, where police had put up a roadblock. Police said the vehicle then tried to ram its way free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The car allegedly hit a police officer and dragged him along the road but officers, who had drawn their guns, eventually detained the suspect. Four other private cars were also damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police strongly condemns the arrested man for disregarding the safety of road users and officers executing their duty. It's a very irresponsible act," Superintendent Tsui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers later found suspected drugs in the vehicle, including methamphetamine, crack cocaine and ketamine, with a total market value of over HK$20,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they also found a Hong Kong identity card which did not belong to the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the driver did not have a driving licence and the vehicle had been rented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial investigation, when the arrested person rented a car, he got a valid driving licence. However, until Friday, his driving license had been expired," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was arrested on suspicion of taking conveyance without authority, furious driving, assaulting police officers, trafficking in dangerous drugs, possessing other's identity card, driving without a licence and driving without a third party risk insurance.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said the government will continue its work on raising living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a social media video message, Lee said consultation meetings will be held with different parties about his upcoming Policy Address, and he will also be going out into the community to hear suggestions from the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current-term government is committed to enhancing people's livelihoods. We implement in detail and make Hong Kong a better place for living and working," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We work hard in aspects of medical care, child care, transportation and housing, making Hong Kong a better place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured people from the transport sector, low income groups, and the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albert Leung from Citybus said after changing the tolls for Hong Kong's three harbour tunnels, traffic congestion at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel had been improved and it had also enhanced the competitiveness of buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A family living in a subdivided flat said they regularly visited the community living room, and there were teachers helping with homework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman living in Zhongshan on the mainland said the elderly health care voucher scheme had been expanded to cover more medical institutions in the Greater Bay Area, and this was more convenient for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive will hold a second public consultation on the Policy Address on Sunday, alongside several ministers. The address itself will be delivered in October.

    'No plans to introduce 100pc loan guarantee for SMEs'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Saturday said the authorities have no plans to roll out a 100 percent loan guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) again.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced details about establishing a new task force to help SMEs deal with their loan payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government launched a special 100 percent loan guarantee scheme during the pandemic to help SMEs cope with cash flow problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, the minister said it was a "special measure" during the Covid-19 pandemic, and about HK$140 billion was approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy is gradually recovering now, if a 100 percent loan guarantee is maintained, it would be a great burden on the government. We will closely monitor the situation, but we don't have any plans to roll out the scheme again in the meantime," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said the government needs "careful consideration", as the default rate of the scheme reached 9.2 percent, which means the default amount was HK$13.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the SAR's economic and trade offices (ETOs) being suppressed by the United States and western countries, Yau said the government had a determined stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were voices from the United States and western countries asking to shut down our ETOs. But we should continue with our work, and shouldn't retreat just because of some opinions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage, the ETOs are running normally. The countries still haven't had further action, so we shouldn't retreat. They're just scaring us, and we shouldn't kneel down."

    Nasa to decide on Boeing Starliner ISS astronauts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa is expected to decide Saturday whether two astronauts who arrived at the International Space Station aboard Boeing's Starliner should return on that craft -- or brace for a longer wait to fly home with rival SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latter solution would not only create a fresh public relations headache for Boeing, but possibly result in astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams spending a total of eight months in orbit, not the eight days as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A decision-making committee, with Nasa chief Bill Nelson sitting in, will meet Saturday to weigh the tough issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US space agency has tentatively scheduled a news conference for 1:00 pm (1700 GMT), presumably to announce its verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After years of Starliner development delays, the spacecraft finally lifted off in early June carrying Wilmore and Williams, both veteran astronauts, to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule was originally set to bring them to Earth after eight days in space, but Nasa put their return on indefinite hold as it studied problems with the craft's propulsion system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials are weighing the highly unusual option of bringing the two astronauts back from the flying laboratory not on their own craft, but aboard a previously scheduled SpaceX vehicle in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engineers at Boeing and Nasa have spent weeks conducting intensive tests on the Starliner's systems, trying to get to the root of the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their worry is that the craft might not have the propulsive power to wrest itself out of orbit and begin the descent toward Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Nasa experts decide the Starliner is not safe, the craft would return without any passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SpaceX Crew-9 mission would then take off in late September, but carrying only two passengers instead of the originally planned four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would remain moored to the ISS until its scheduled return in February, bringing back its own crew members plus their two stranded colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an approach would be a stinging blow to the already tarnished image of US giant Boeing, whose airplane arm has been beset in recent years with concerns about safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten years ago, following the retirement of the Space Shuttle, Nasa ordered new vessels from both Boeing and SpaceX that could ferry astronauts to and from the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With two such vehicles available, Nasa reasoned, there would always be a backup in case one of the two experienced problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Elon Musk's SpaceX beat Boeing to the punch and has been the lone vehicle used to taxi astronauts for the past four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's crewed Starliner flight, which followed years of delays and disappointments during the craft's development, was meant to be a last test of the vehicle before it enters regular operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa has said the astronauts on the ISS have plenty of supplies, are trained for extended stays and have plenty of experiments to conduct. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Friday said it strongly disapproves and rejects what it described as biased reporting by the New York Times on the new National Security Exhibition Gallery at the Hong Kong History Museum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said an article headlined "A History Museum Shows How China Wants to Remake Hong Kong" carried false and misleading narratives against the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said the newspaper had “completely ignored the large-scale and incessant riots that occurred in 2019 and the very fact of the failed attempt to stage the Hong Kong version of 'colour-revolution', which have continuously devastated society, livelihood and economy of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It has also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community, and the business environment as well, to return to normalcy. The New York Times has demonstrated hypocrisy with double standards.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said visitors had been coming in droves to the gallery, with 10,000 entering by the end of its fourth day, and that it had received positive reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The untruthful reporting of the New York Times article about the gallery is completely out of order and twisting the facts,” the spokesman added.

  Police have launched a "major operation" to find the suspect, who is on the run, the spokeswoman said, adding that a "wide area" had been cordoned off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were at the scene with helicopters and emergency vehicles, and had asked the public to avoid the area, according to the broadcaster ZDF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was part of a series of events to celebrate the city's 650th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted online, Tim-Oliver Kurzbach, the mayor of Solingen, said the whole city was in "shock, horror and great grief".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all wanted to celebrate our town's anniversary together and now we have to mourn the dead and injured," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kurzbach thanked the emergency services for their work at the scene and expressed sympathy with those who had witnessed the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It tears my heart apart that there was an attack on our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost. I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solingen is a city of some 150,000 people located an equal distance from Duesseldorf and Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People had gathered in the town on Friday evening for the first day of a three-day "Festival of Diversity", according to the event's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was set to feature music, street theatre, variety shows and comedians in the city centre and several other areas, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to 75,000 visitors were expected to attend over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Solinger Tageblatt newspaper reported that one of the co-organisers of the festival had come on stage to cancel the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd were also asked to leave the city centre, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the announcement, thousands of attendees cleared the area, the paper reported, with a journalist at the scene describing the atmosphere as "ghostly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People left the scene in shock, but calmly," Philipp Mueller, one of the organisers, told the newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness who spoke to the Tageblatt said he was a few metres from the attack, not far from the stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said the man, Lars Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who was drunk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground and several pools of blood, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has seen a series of knife attacks over the past 12 months, with Interior Minister Nancy Faeser promising to crack down on knife crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police officer was killed and five people were wounded in a knife attack at a far-right rally in the city of Mannheim in late May. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Friday as dovish remarks from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell solidified expectations that the central bank will cut its key policy rate in September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In highly anticipated comments before the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, Powell said "the time has come" to lower the Fed funds target rate, and "the upside risks of inflation have diminished".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The long wait is over," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. "This was the dovish shift that market participants have been waiting for."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is clearly turning to the dovish camp and Powell has made it crystal clear that September will be the start of multiple rate cuts coming the remainder of this year," Detrick added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock indexes jumped after the release of Powell's prepared remarks, with megacaps Nvidia, Apple and Tesla providing the most muscle. Small caps and regional banks were outperformers, rising 3.2 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Financials are at an all-time high, with a huge surge from regional banks," Detrick said. "One would think if a major calamity or a recession were on the horizon, regional banks and financials wouldn't be as strong as they’ve been."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes logged weekly advances, standing on the shoulders of last week's largest Friday-to-Friday percentage gains of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next week, the data-dependent Fed will have a raft of economic indicators to consider ahead of its September rate decision, including the Commerce Department's revised second-quarter GDP and its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which includes the Fed's preferred inflation yardstick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.14 percent, to 41,175, the S&P 500 gained 1.15 percent, to 5,635 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.47 percent, to 17,878.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workday beat quarterly revenue expectations and announced a US$1 billion stock buyback plan, sending shares of the human resources software firm up 12.5 percent, the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ross Stores gained 1.8 percent after the discount retailer raised its fiscal 2024 profit forecast. Turbo Tax's parent Intuit sagged 6.8 percent in response to disappointing quarterly revenue. (Reuters)

    Independent Kennedy drops US poll bid, backs Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Robert F Kennedy Jr announces that he's dropping his presidential run. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767443_1_20240824033757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20 percent of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, US President John F Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy said on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts. (Reuters)

    In Kyiv, Modi says diplomacy can end Ukraine crisis

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Narendra Modi is greeted by Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the Indian leader makes a historic visit to Kyiv. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767440_1_20240824015244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday to sit down for talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine and offered to act as a friend to help bring peace as the two leaders met in wartime Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history comes at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in Februaru 2022, with Moscow making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The optics closely resembled the Indian leader's visit to Moscow last month where he called for peace and embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, angering Ukraine where a Russian missile strike hit a children's hospital on the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The road to resolution can only be found through dialogue and diplomacy. And we should move in that direction without wasting any time. Both sides should sit together to find a way out of this crisis," Modi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to assure you that India is ready to play an active role in any efforts towards peace. If I can play any role in this personally, I will do that, I want to assure you as a friend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what Kyiv made of his remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, which traditionally has close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war, but also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both leaders described Modi's visit as "historic" in their statements, in which Modi spoke second and Zelenskiy did not have an opportunity to respond to the call for dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskiy said that "the matter of ending the war and a just peace are the priority for Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that talks were out of the question after Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6. (Reuters)

    UK police drop poll date bet probe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An aide to former British PM Rishi Sunak was among those accused of placing bets on the election date. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767438_1_20240824011046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police announced on Friday that a probe into betting on the date of the last general election had ended, saying the bar for misconduct had not been met.
 <br>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said in late June it would investigate a "small number" of bets placed on the timing of last month's elections, as part of a joint probe with the gambling watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scandal overshadowed the latter stages of campaigning ahead of the July 5 poll, after it emerged senior Conservative officials and one of then-prime minister Rishi Sunak's aides had placed bets shortly before he announced the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met also arrested one of its officers on suspicion of misconduct in public office over election betting claims, while six other officers were identified as having placed bets on its date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission launched an investigation into whether any broke laws on "cheating" while the Met opened a separate inquiry into whether other criminal offences had been committed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While political bets are allowed in the UK, using insider knowledge to make them is against the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Britain's biggest police force announced its criminal investigation had concluded with no action being taken, including against the officer who had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met said the "high bar" for proving misconduct in public office had not been met, following advice from the country's prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission investigation remains ongoing and could still result in criminal charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile the Met's internal watchdog unit is continuing to investigate the seven officers alleged to have placed bets on the election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These allegations caused a significant dent in public confidence during the election campaign and it was right that they were investigated to explore all possible offences," Detective Superintendent Katherine Goodwin said in a statement. (AFP)

    Fed's Powell says time has come to cut rates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell arrives at the Jackson Hole talks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767436_1_20240824003034.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday offered an explicit endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job market would be unwelcome and expressing confidence that inflation was within reach of the US central bank's 2 percent target.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased," Powell said in a highly anticipated speech to the Kansas City Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referencing the two goals that the Fed is tasked by Congress to achieve, Powell said his "confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent," after rising to about 7 percent during the Covid-19 pandemic, while unemployment is increasing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Powell said the jump of nearly a percentage point in the unemployment rate over the past year was due largely to rising labour supply and slowed hiring, not increased layoffs, he also was emphatic that the Fed wanted to prevent any further erosion – his prior talk of labour market "pain" as necessary to control inflation now a thing of the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current unemployment rate of 4.3 percent is roughly at the level Fed officials feel is consistent with stable inflation over the longer run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labour market conditions," Powell said. "We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labour market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders on Friday continued to bet on a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed's September 17-18 meeting, but after Powell's remarks priced in about a one-in-three chance of a bigger half-percentage-point cut, up from a little more than a one-in-four probability earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell was clear about the first rate cut, but not so much about the next ones, so I don't think he'll be exploding out of the blocks with a 50-basis-point cut," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "I think slow and steady is how the Fed wants to pace this early part of the easing." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer was injured during an operation on Princess Margaret Road on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video circulating online, swarms of officers had surrounded a northbound silver vehicle opposite Hung Hom Divisional Police Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of them had drawn their guns and demanded the driver pull over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the driver refused to cooperate, and tried to break free from the road block by jolting back and forth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver eventually came to a halt after colliding with another vehicle, before being apprehended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One officer who was hit in the waist was helped up by other colleagues, and led onto a police van.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second driver caught in the incident suffered neck injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All northbound lanes of the major thoroughfare were sealed off at around 8.40pm, causing severe traffic disruption.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed the success of his administration in attracting foreign talent and businesses to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video message as part of his Policy Address consultation, Mr Lee said officials have gone all out to look for new opportunities over the past year, despite facing many challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Hong Kong is going through economic transformation, we have continuously strengthened our efforts to grab talent and attract enterprises and capital to Hong Kong," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With a special focus on innovation and technology, we pursue development in new quality productive forces and reinforce our status as an international financial centre, aviation hub and trade centre. We will build Hong Kong into a global hub for high-calibre talent and strive for economic growth and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured a number of people who decided to set up shop in Hong Kong recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Daniel Seah, the chief executive of Los Angeles-based Digital Domain, an Oscar-winning production house specialising in visual effects for movies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I deal with officials in Hong Kong, they are clear about what this place needs. They are also clear about what our company needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A research and development base is most crucial for a company, especially for us since we are built on technology."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of July, Hong Kong has engaged over 100 strategic and innovation and technology enterprises which agreed to set up or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have generated investment of HK$52 billion and created more than 15,000 jobs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

    Calls to better protect digital platform workers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A union group has called on the government to do more to protect the rights of digital platform workers after pointing to a survey that it said highlighted their plight, especially those who suffered work-related injuries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who's also chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, proposed setting up a committee to allow workers to better reflect their views and give them greater bargaining power, similar to what Singapore has done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said government officials, employer and employee representatives as well as union members could sit on the committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their [the workers'] representatives can participate in the committee and they can discuss the details, for example the amount of each order, and... the time limit of receiving the order online," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent survey jointly conducted by the group and the Federation of Hong Kong Transportation and Logistics Industry Unions, just under a quarter of about 360 interviewees – who are mainly courier or food delivery workers – said they had been injured at work, but only 13 percent of them received compensation and most were not satisfied with the amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions said the workers lack bargaining power because a majority of them are self-employed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam also pointed out that even though some companies would purchase casualty insurance, it is not enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that the Labour Department and the government can encourage the platform companies to purchase the insurance, maybe the compensation is similar to the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, to provide better protection and compensation, to also include, for example, support them for the medical treatment in hospitals or clinics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said the authorities should also look into requiring the companies to offer workers retirement protection.

    At least 14 killed in Nepal bus crash

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 14 people were killed, 16 others injured and several more believed to be missing after a bus carrying dozens of Indian pilgrims drove off a key highway on Friday in Nepal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said the bus veered off Prithvi Highway and rolled towards a fast-flowing river, stopping on the rocky bank just shy of the rushing, murky water. The top part of the bus was ripped, but the wreckage did not plunge into the Marsyangdi River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An armed police spokesperson said that, among those pulled out of from the bus, 14 were declared dead and 16 were injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials could not yet say how many more were missing or the exact number of people on the bus when it crashed, but they estimated there were some four dozen on board at the time of the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police and army rescuers were helping to pull people from the wreckage near Abukhaireni, a town about 120 kilometres west of the capital, Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bus from neighbouring Indian town of Gorakhpur was heading toward Kathmandu from the resort town of Pokhara on Friday when it drove off the highway midway in the journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, two buses were swept by landslides not too far from Friday's accident site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 65 people on board those two buses, only three survived and only about half the bodies were recovered. The wreckage of those buses have not been found yet but authorities have continued to search.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bus accidents in Nepal are mostly due to poorly maintained roads and vehicles and much of the country is covered by mountains with narrow roads. (AP)

    Faulty confirmations behind hospital feeding tube case

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An “uncommon” false pH test result and an inaccurate medical image were to blame for a blunder at Queen Elizabeth Hospital involving a patient's feeding tube being inserted into his airway and left undetected in June this year, hospital bosses said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They also said the 61-year-old male patient, who was paralysed, remained under intensive care in a critical state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said a nurse replaced the nasogastric tube for the patient in an orthopaedic ward as part of normal procedures on June 16, before another nurse reinserted the apparatus the same evening. But the patient's condition deteriorated around a day later, with doctors finding the tube in his left bronchus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Kam-shing, a doctor who led a root cause analysis panel, said the medics had performed pH tests and an X-ray to check the position of the tube, before proceeding to feed the patient fluids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sample tested came back acidic, which normally means the nasogastric tube is in the stomach, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, which is a little bit uncommon, the nasogastric tube has gone via the left bronchus into the left pleural space, which is the space between the lungs and the thoracic cage," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of [the patient's] chest infection, there is some fluid accumulating in the pleural cavity, which is probably infected. When the pleural fluid is probably infected, it will become acidic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who's also the chief executive of Kwong Wah Hospital, said the houseman checking the X-ray was likely inexperienced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the things that usually the doctor will look at is the tip of the nasogastric tube. Whenever it is in a standard position, then it is one of the factors that we can use to judge whether the nasogastric tube is in the correct space," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, because the chest X-ray doesn't show clearly the tip of the nasogastric tube, we think that the doctor involved probably doesn't have enough clinical experience to make sure that the nasogastric tube is indeed in the correct space."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for why the tube was left undetected, Tang said patients normally would show symptoms only after one to two litres had been accumulated in the cavity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel suggested reviewing the Hospital Authority's internal guidelines on inserting nasogastric tubes and consider whether to perform an X-ray examination on high-risk patients before feeding them liquids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also proposed having the attending doctor review previous clinical results in complicated circumstances, as well as coming up with a more standardised medical imaging procedure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, Queen Elizabeth Hospital's chief executive, apologised to the patient and his family, saying authorities would follow up on the panel's suggestions as soon as possible and provide training and assessment to the medics involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the houseman should be held accountable, Cheung said the doctor was part of the team and that "the responsibility ultimately lies with the hospital".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The houseman had finished the internship at the orthopaedic unit and officials would follow up according to the panel's report and established procedures, he added.

    Commerce Ministry hears views on auto tariff hikes

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Commerce on Friday convened a meeting to hear opinions and suggestions from industry and academic experts on increasing tariffs on the import of fuel-powered cars with large-displacement engines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, representatives from relevant industry organisations, research institutions and automotive companies attended the talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Commission said earlier it planned to slap five-year import duties of up to 36 percent on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), unless Beijing can offer Brussels alternative solutions to end their row over state subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rates were revised slightly under a draft plan this week
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels already hit EVs imported from China with hefty provisional tariffs last month -- on top of current duties of 10 percent -- after an anti-subsidy probe found they were unfairly undermining European rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariffs are subject to the approval of the European Union member states. A final decision must be made by early November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has filed an appeal with the World Trade Organisation over the EV tariffs, calling them unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has launched investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products amid heightened trade tensions. (Agencies)

    HKMA to look into SMEs' struggles with bank repayments

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Arthur Yuen, will lead a new task force to look into small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are having trouble with banks over their loan repayments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This task force was formed in response to calls from small businesses urging lenders to stop requesting early repayments or recalling loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives from the Hong Kong Association of Banks on Friday morning, HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said the new body would aim at helping individual SMEs resolve their funding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each case has its own background and uniqueness, and each case could be handled differently. I would encourage business chambers or companies to refer cases to the Authority immediately, if they hear or see any firms having difficulties, so that they can be dealt with by the task force and resolved with banks quickly,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another press briefing, the co-chairperson of the task force, Arthur Yuen, said the HKMA has received only a small number of complaints from SMEs which required its intervention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen added the banking sector has been supporting SMEs, noting that lenders have allowed around 4,000 small businesses to delay their loan repayments since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said a potential interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month could help struggling small firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest burden that they (SMEs) are facing right now is perhaps much higher than three years ago,” he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's really an expectational issue, the forward-looking, where interest rates are heading that would help banks in assessing the repayment ability of a corporate model, including SMEs, because then they will have the interest rate outlook. They fit the interest rate outlook into their credit models, and that would definitely be helpful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In face of concerns over the tightening policy of property loans, Yuen said the HKMA has urged lenders to complete their vetting requests for such loans within two weeks, unless applicants fail to provide the adequate information needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) welcomed the establishment of the task force, saying the new group would help SMEs in acquiring capital and promoting Hong Kong's economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said small businesses still need more support to overcome these difficult times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government may consider restarting the 100 percent guaranteed loan and also the payment holiday scheme. That is just pay the interest without repaying the principal, like for a period of 12 months," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all hope that (in) 2025, things will improve. And I hope as the economic situation improves, cash flow for the companies will also improve."

    'More support, funding needed for HK Esports'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More support is needed for talented Hong Kong gamers who often have to pay their own way to compete overseas, said the founding president of the Esports Association of Hong Kong, China on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eric Yeung made the comment after 16-year-old Cheng Yip-kai took home the city's first Pokémon GO world championship title after booking his own trip to Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now unfortunately, most of the games are commercially running for those competitions, rather than [falling] within the traditional sports framework," he told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think it's a bit difficult [using] the traditional funding way to fund them and to support them to go to compete [against] others internationally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said Esports can be integrated with other industries to drive growth, noting the lack of a professional league and competitions in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Esports itself is not a standalone industry. But rather, in Hong Kong we could work closely together with the innovation and technology industry as well as the traditional sport industry in order to groom a better result for the Esports industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the success of blockbuster game "Wukong" - or "Monkey King" - marked a milestone for China's Esports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game, based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, is the first triple-A video game in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major difference [between] those AAA games and those traditional Esports games is the investment. When we are talking about the AAA level games, it's like shooting a movie - we're talking about maybe even hundreds of millions dollars of investment for a single game," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investment for a traditional mobile game is much lower."

<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Alibaba on Friday said it would upgrade its Hong Kong-listed shares to primary status, opening it up to China's huge army of investors that could potentially rake in billions of dollars for the firm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by shareholders during its annual general meeting on Thursday will provide a much-needed boost to the firm, which has underperformed the market in recent years due to to weak consumption and after a crackdown by Beijing on the tech industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to announce that the voluntary conversion of our secondary listing to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will become effective on August 28, 2024," the company announced on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, which is also listed in New York, had flagged the idea two years ago amid worries about a regulatory drive by US authorities as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington, though that was later put off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba has been primarily traded in New York since 2014 and remained dual-listed after its notable return to Hong Kong through a second listing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the firm's shares in Hong Kong are down about 75 percent from their peak in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A conversion to primary status in Hong Kong could pave way for Alibaba to enter a cross-border scheme that allows investors in Shenzhen and Shanghai to trade Hong Kong-listed shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would open it up to China's more than 200 million investors and could see capital inflows of up to US$19.5 billion in the first six months of inclusion, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba this month reported a 29 percent fall in quarterly profit as it battles sluggish activity among China's consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uncertainty about Alibaba's future development has persisted since Beijing scuttled a planned initial public offering of the company's financial services arm, Ant Group, in late 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancelled listing -- which would likely have been the biggest in history -- was followed a month later by an announcement that Alibaba was under formal investigation in China for alleged monopolistic practices. (AFP)

    Harris secures US presidential nomination

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Kamala Harris called on Americans to join her to “chart a new way forward” as she accepted the Democratic nomination on Thursday, arguing her personal story and her career as a prosecutor made her uniquely qualified to protect their interests and beat Republican candidate Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking the stage to a thunderous standing ovation at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris sought to introduce herself to the American public and outline her vision for leading the nation for the next four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' address in Chicago caps a whirlwind eight weeks in American politics and manifests the stunning reversal of Democratic fortunes just 75 days until Election Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party leaders who had publicly despaired over President Joe Biden's candidacy after his disastrous debate against Trump in June, were jubilant both at the historic nature of Harris' candidacy which has boosted their hopes for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Harris became the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to accept a major party's presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If elected, she would become the first female US president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected. But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris talked about being raised primarily by her mother in San Francisco's East Bay after her parents divorced, and being raised as well by friends and caregivers who were “family by love.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also detailed a key part of her political origin story, when Wanda, her best friend from high school, confided in her that she was being abused by her stepfather and came to live with Harris' family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor. To protect people like Wanda,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outlining her career as a prosecutor, state attorney general, senator and now vice president, Harris said, “My entire career I’ve only had one client: the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said Trump has only ever acted in the interests of "the only client he has ever had: himself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she took the stage, she saw a sea of female delegates and Democratic supporters wearing white — the colour of women’s suffrage — the movement that culminated with American women securing the right to vote in 1920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also pledged to get a Gaza ceasefire deal completed and said as US president she would stand with Ukraine and not "cozy up" to dictators like Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done." (Agencies)

    'Replace Covid facilities with carpark at cruise port'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jeff Bent has revised his earlier forecast and says Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767319_1_20240823104145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday called for the government to remove unused Covid facilities near the site and build an open-air carpark to improve transport links to the facility.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jeff Bent, the managing director of World Wide Cruise Terminals, was commenting on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme after the terminal welcomed the only cruise ship to dock there this month, the Norwegian Spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent revised his earlier forecast and said Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we're expecting about 100 total ship calls... The cruise business is going to be slow this year and next, as we work our way out of the post-Covid trough," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used to have a home-based carrier, a cruise line based in Hong Kong that went out of business and Hong Kong saved its air carrier. We did not save our cruise line... We're now sort of dealing with cruise lines that come from time to time and on occasion, but are not year round based here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent said the unused Covid facilities were a "detraction" of the cruise terminal, and the government should remove them and make use of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Where all those Covid facilities are now, it would be quite easy to have a large open-air carpark there. I think at a minimum, that would be a big boon because we know that 45 percent of Hong Kong people who take a cruise have a car. Eighty-five percent of those would like to drive themselves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If those people can drive themselves, then they will not be fighting for a limited taxi supply with the out-of-town guests. So there are some quick fixes that should be put in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government could allow cab drivers to impose a surcharge for pick-ups at the terminal to attract more taxis to the port.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian cyclist Ben O'Connor soloed to a stunning victory in stage six of the Vuelta a España on Thursday, taking the red jersey from three-time winner Primoz Roglic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rider and Gijs Leemreize attacked from a breakaway group before O'Connor later left the Dutchman behind with 27 kilometres to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor opened up a defendable lead of four minutes 51 seconds in the general classification ahead of veteran Roglic, as the peloton came in well over six minutes down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt a little bit in my own world today. I just went for it, I felt today was just a day to seize my opportunity and I laid it all out there," O'Connor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I could win this stage from the start – it's pretty special when you can just go out and crush it like that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor became the fifth Australian to win stages at all three Grand Tours after winning at the Giro in 2020 and at the Tour de France in 2021. (AFP)

    Chelsea give Maresca first win in Conference League

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea secured their first victory under new coach Enzo Maresca with a 2-0 victory over Servette in their Conference League play-off round first leg on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hosts struggled to break down their opponents in the first half at Stamford Bridge before Christopher Nkunku put them in front with a 50th-minute penalty, just his fourth goal for the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guiu somehow contrived to miss an open goal a few minutes later, but Noni Madueke moved Chelsea closer to a group-stage place ahead of next week's second leg by firing home from Enzo Fernandez's pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiemoko Ouattara almost pulled one back for Swiss side Servette late on when his deflected strike hit the crossbar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a welcome win for Chelsea after suffering a 2-0 loss in Maresca's debut game against Manchester City at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Blues are making their return to European competition after finishing sixth in the Premier League last season under Mauricio Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are learning how to manage the game," said Maresca, who led Leicester to promotion to the Premier League last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was important to win the game with nine changes. There were many good things," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a scare for Chelsea, as key player Cole Palmer went down the dug-out holding the back of his leg at full-time after coming on as a second-half substitute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cole felt something but he looks fine. Hopefully it is no problem and he can be available for Sunday's game against Wolves," Maresca said. (AFP)

    Canada to order rail companies to resume operations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Canadian government moved quickly on Thursday to end an unprecedented rail stoppage, announcing it would ask the country's industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order that could come in a few days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Canada's top two railroads had locked out more than 9,000 unionised workers earlier in the day, triggering a simultaneous rail stoppage that business groups said could inflict hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon told reporters he was acting "to ensure that the activities of both of these rail companies immediately resume" and said he was referring the matter to the board for binding arbitration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MacKinnon said he was confident the board would issue a back-to-work order within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I assume that the trains will be running within days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies – Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City – and the Teamsters union blamed each other for the work stoppage after multiple rounds of talks failed to yield an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision marked a change of mind by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which had long made clear its desire to see the matter settled at the bargaining table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We gave negotiations every possible opportunity to succeed ... but we have an impasse here," said MacKinnon. "And that is why we have come to this decision today." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All three major US stock indexes lost ground on Thursday, weighed by technology shares, as Treasury yields rose on easing recession fears and global central bank officials convened at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The so-called Magnificent Seven megacap growth stocks weighed heaviest on the tech-laden Nasdaq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There doesn't appear to be any kind of clear catalyst as to what's driving this sell-off," Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People may be trying to square positions a little bit ahead of Nvidia (earnings) next week, or risk-out ahead of (US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell's Jackson Hole speech tomorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Central bank officials from around the world have gathered in Jackson Hole for the annual Economic Symposium. Investors will be laser focused on Powell's address on Friday for clues on the timing and extent of the Fed's policy easing cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell is expected to assure the markets that the Fed will cut rates in September, Ladner said. "He'll be coy with the question about whether it's going to be a 25 or 50 basis point cut, but will probably try to lead the market towards 25."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will say he expects to start slow but will also emphasize that if they do see any further weakness in the labor market they can speed things up," Ladner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News of increasing US jobless claims, following Wednesday's sharply lower benchmark payrolls revision, appear to confirm the labour market is less robust than expected and is gradually softening. This soothed recession fears while bolstering the case for a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September policy meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sentiment was echoed in remarks on Thursday from Kansas City Fed President Frank Schmid, Boston Fed President Susan Collins, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, all of whom indicated that a rate-cutting phase is shortly forthcoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What Fed officials are saying is a rate cut is definitely on the table, but there's still time between now and September and data can move things," Martin said.
  <br/>

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.43 percent, to 40,713. The S&P 500 lost 0.89 percent, at 5,571 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.67 percent to 17,619. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities confirmed late on Thursday that five Chinese nationals were among nine people who died when a small plane crashed minutes after taking off from Bangkok’s main airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports in Thailand say the dead included children aged 12 and 13, as well as three adults in their 40s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other four victims were Thai nationals, including two pilots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok said Thai authorities had confirmed the death of five Chinese nationals, and it was seeking further information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Immigration Department said no SAR residents were involved in the tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports say the jet took off from Bangkok’s main Suvarnabhumi Airport at 2.46pm. Air traffic control lost radio and radar contact with the aircraft 11 minutes later, when it was an estimated 35 kilometres southeast of the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai media said rescuers found no survivors at the crash site in a mangrove swamp in Chachoengsao province about 40 kilometres from the airport. Rescue teams continued their work into the night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cessna Caravan C208B operated by the Thai Flying Service Company had been bound for the coastal province of Krabi. (Additional reporting by AP, Xinhua)

    US top court revives Arizona voter rules

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767277_1_20240823034309.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court on Thursday revived part of an Arizona voter law requiring documented proof of US citizenship to register to vote, in response to a request from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The justices in a 5-4 ruling agreed to reinstate a provision of the law after a federal judge blocked it in response to legal challenges by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration and advocacy groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision comes before the November 5 election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is facing off against Republican former President Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature adopted new restrictions on voter registration in 2022. The law requires applicants who submit a federal registration form to provide evidence of US citizenship to vote in presidential elections or vote by mail in any federal election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter registrants who use a separate, state-created form face even tighter restrictions. Without proof of US citizenship, state applications are rejected in their entirety, and officials who fail to do so face a minor felony charge under the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court's ruling revived the restriction related to the state voter registration form, but kept intact a judicial decision blocking the provision that sought to tighten limits on the federal form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts joined with fellow conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch to grant Republicans' request in part, though Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the entire request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would have denied the request in full. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767274_1_20240823013000.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal on Thursday ratified President Nicolas Maduro's victory in the July 28 presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The supreme tribunal has reviewed material from the electoral authority and agrees that Maduro won the election, court president Caryslia Rodriguez said, adding the decision cannot be appealed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The electoral material assessed is certified unobjectionably and the results of the presidential election of July 28 released by the national electoral council, where Nicolas Maduro was elected president of the republic, are validated," said Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electoral authority has said since the night of the election that Maduro won just over half of votes, though it has not published full tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has published online what it says are 83 percent of voting machine tallies, which give its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez a hearty 67 percent support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Western countries have urged full publication of results, while Russia, China and others have congratulated Maduro on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme court would be in violation of separation of powers rules in the constitution if it were to carry out any electoral functions, thus making its ruling null, the opposition said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ratification gives Maduro, who took office in 2013, another six-year term, set to begin in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president, a long-time ruling party official before he rose to the presidency, had asked the court to verify the results. The court's judges summoned all the candidates to hand over the copies of voting machine tallies they are entitled to by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez did not attend the summons. The opposition says the court, though constitutionally independent, operates as an arm of the ruling party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition's failure to hand over its copies and Gonzalez's non-appearance are "blatant disrespect", Rodriguez said, and exposes him to sanctions, though she did not specify what kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 23 protesters have been killed at anti-government demonstrations since the election, and some 2,400 arrested, according to the United Nations. Maduro says the demonstrators are extremists. (Reuters)

    Indonesia shelves elections shake-up amid protests

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767270_1_20240822233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament shelved planned changes to electoral laws on Thursday after protesters in the capital set fires and faced down tear gas and water cannon over legislation they say would weaken opponents of the outgoing president and his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislature, dominated by supporters of outgoing President Joko Widodo and his successor, Prabowo Subianto, was scheduled to vote to reverse changes to election laws made by the constitutional court, a ruling that effectively reopened a chance for a vocal government critic to run in regional elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties backing Prabowo had earlier this week rallied behind a single candidate for the influential post of Jakarta governor, killing off chances of the president-elect's rival, Anies Baswedan, from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anies at the time needed the backing from a party or a coalition of parties with at least 20 percent of seats in the local parliament, under rules for regional elections in place since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tuesday's Constitutional Court ruling had lowered the threshold to under 10 percent, giving Anies a chance to be nominated by the only party that has not named a candidate, PDIP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national parliament had sought to return to the previous threshold, contradicting the country's highest court in a move critics said would favour the outgoing president and his family, and the incoming government, as they consolidate power and freeze out any opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a republic. It's a democracy, but if its leadership is decided by one person, or an oligarchy, we can't accept that," said 29-year-old teacher Afif Sidik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, deputy parliament speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad said that deliberations would be resumed by the incoming parliament, meaning there would be no change for this year's regional elections, scheduled for November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means Anies will be able to seek the Jakarta governor's office if PDIP nominates him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parliament decision came as security forces fired tear gas and water cannon as protesters breached and set ablaze part of the gates of parliament, while demonstrations broke out across the country against the election law changes. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at a hotel in South Korea has killed seven people and injured 12 others, fire authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fire began on the eighth floor of the nine-story hotel in Bucheon, just west of the capital Seoul at around 7.40pm on Thursday, before being put out in about two hours, according to the interior ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven people died, mostly guests, and 12 were sent to hospitals for treatment, including three in critical condition, said Lee Sang-don, an official at the Bucheon fire station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those killed were a couple who jumped out the windows onto an air mattress installed in front of the building, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was unfolded normally but appeared to have flipped over when they jumped down," he told a televised briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities were looking into the exact cause of the incident, adding there were no sprinklers inside, which was not mandatory when the building was completed in 2003, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Lee Sang-min ordered all-out rescue efforts by mobilising all available resources, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 70 vehicles and 160 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, Yonhap news agency said, citing provincial fire authorities.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Thursday said the giant panda twins born a week ago were gradually stabilising and gaining weight, with the animal's iconic black patches starting to show on parts of the cubs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it also said the pair remained fragile and were being monitored by mainland experts and the park's animal care team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said the female cub weighs around 172 grammes and her younger brother about 168 grammes, and black spots were "vaguely visible" on their eyes, ears and shoulders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are both feeding and defecating normally under the assistance of experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. The twin cubs are also displaying healthy appetites by drinking up to 10 grammes of milk per meal, six times per day," Ocean Park said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the two cubs are stabilising, they are still fragile and are under 24-hour intensive care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said caretakers were supporting the mother panda, Ying Ying, with her post-labour recovery, and experts were trying to milk her for the cubs to consume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying has been improving her caring and nursing behaviours, the park added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth to the twins last Thursday, which was also the eve of her 19th birthday, or the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Italian coast guard on Thursday said the body of British tech magnate Mike Lynch was among those recovered off the coast of Sicily from the wreckage of a superyacht.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One woman remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies of Lynch, who had been celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with his family and the people who had defended him at trial in the United States, and five others were recovered by rescue crews following Monday's tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bayesian, a 56-metre British-flagged yacht, went down in a storm early Monday as it was moored about a kilometre offshore. Civil protection officials said they believe the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, and sank quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators are now looking at why the Bayesian sank, killing at least six people. A seventh remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen of the 22 people aboard survived, including a mother who reported holding her one-year-old baby over the waves to save her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers have struggled to find the bodies in the yacht’s hull on the seabed 50 metres underwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would need a crystal ball to know when we'll be able to find the next body," said Luca Cari, spokesperson for the fire rescue service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's very difficult to move inside the wreckage. Moving just one metre can take up to 24 hours,” Cari said. (AP)

Photo courtesy of the Hong Kong Jockey Club" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767229_1_20240822172433.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It is up to the Hong Kong Jockey Club to call the shots on how to use a parcel of land it owns in upmarket Happy Valley, the government said on Thursday, after the non-profit body was given the green light to redevelop its sports complex there into a residential site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But a lawmaker said the charity and gaming organisation should provide details on the intended use of housing blocks at 48 Shan Kwong Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Buildings Department had in June approved the club's plan for constructing three 21-storey residential buildings with a total gross floor area of nearly 486,000 square feet, as well as a block to offer recreational facilities for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said the site was brought by the body through public auction, and that the lease did not have any restrictions on its land use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jockey Club is not required to apply for modifying its lease or pay a land premium to construct residential buildings on the site," the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the Jockey Club's decision, as a private land owner, whether and when to develop the site for residential purposes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site was occupied by two stable blocks in the 1930s, before it was rezoned for residential purposes in 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had periodically applied to renew the site's use as a recreational facility since then. The sports complex houses facilities such as tennis and squash courts, a golf simulation room, and fitness studios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmaker Andrew Lam noted the organisation owed the general public an explanation on the project, which he said had attracted a lot of attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are guessing [whether] the Jockey Club would be renting [out] the flats or even selling the flats to the general public...it attracts a lot of queries and concerns," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club was recently asked by the Town Planning Board to "actively implement" the zoned use of the site as originally designated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In securing the extension of the temporary planning permit this year, the organisation "had committed to redevelop the site into a residential cum sports complex, subject to further studies to be undertaken".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said he will unveil measures to address substandard living conditions in subdivided flats at the appropriate time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his Facebook page, Lee said he has received a report from a task force looking into subdivided flats, after officials wrapped up their research and gathered views from different stakeholders over the past 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report from the task force includes suggestions for minimum living standards and ways to replace this type of housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an official statement, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the task force, said the government is expected to provide 308,000 public housing units in the upcoming decade and these homes could offer a solution to long-existing subdivided housing issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that his task force will submit a follow-up report within one month, as instructed by the CE.

 China said it firmly opposes any country allowing the Dalai Lama to make visits under any pretext.

  On Wednesday, senior US officials held talks with the Dalai Lama in New York where he was visiting to receive medical treatment. He met with US State Department official Uzra Zeya and White House National Security Council official Kelly Razzouk.

  "China has made solemn protests with the US," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing on Thursday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Walz formally accepted his nomination to be the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate in a keynote address on Wednesday at the party's convention in Chicago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It's the honour of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason -- we love this country," Walz said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Minnesota governor, who was little known in America 15 days ago, acknowledged he had never given such a big speech but said that as a former high school football coach, "I have given a lot of pep talks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd responded with chants of "Coach, Coach, Coach!" Walz brought his plain-speaking style and small-town values to the national stage, joined by a litany of political luminaries and star entertainers on the third night of the Democratic National Convention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said America should be a place where children don't go hungry, healthcare and housing are human rights, "and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom," referring to Republican assaults on abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He spoke of preserving the freedoms that Democrats say are under attack from Trump, who is making his third major-party run for the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said a second Trump White House would serve nobody except the wealthy and most extreme.

    Chinese &amp; Western medicine collab for better care

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in family medicine on Thursday called on people to consult both a family doctor and a Chinese medicine practitioner once a year for regular check ups, adding that preventive care could lessen the burden on medical staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Liberal Party conducted a telephone questionnaire with more than 2,000 people over the past two months, in the hope of strengthening collaboration between Chinese and Western medical practitioners to better serve the public, and 70 percent said they would accept this medical partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Billy Chiu, a member of the party, said this "one plus one is greater than two" method of seeing two different practitioners could increase the chance of catching medical conditions early on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the aim is to do preventive care, so definitely with preventive care doing better, then obviously the percentage [of those] going to hospital will be much lower, so that will lead to less manpower demand inside the hospital," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the Hong Kong government's direction [on developing] the primary care commission and also 18 district health centres, I think we are looking forward to the outcome and also for the efficiency of increasing all these primary care preventive service models so with that, fewer people will go to inpatient [facilities] so the staff, the manpower planning, all this can be reviewed much efficiently."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chiu said that promoting collaboration could also allow for better communication and teamwork between the two medical fields when treating the same patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, I think many people, even including healthcare people, when we are not familiar about, for example, the drug interaction of Western medicine and herbs, so we simply tell people not to mix together or separate by four hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually with more evidence we know that some Chinese medicine and also Western medicine when taken together, we can see the more beneficial effect. Number two, [Chinese medicine] actually alleviates the side effects of some of the Western medicine."

 MTR passengers can ride on a replica of the rail operator's first-generation trains from Thursday, as part of the company's 45th anniversary celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The train will run on various lines until the end of the year and will be showcased at Choi Hung Station on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has the red and white front of the first-generation trains, as well as the MTR logo from back in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inside there are the ball-shaped straphangers of old, and an orange-yellow ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lighting has also been adjusted to a yellowish colour to give passengers a sense that they are travelling back in time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aaron was among hundreds of train enthusiasts who boarded the inaugural train at Choi Hung on Thursday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first time we saw the train we [thought] that it is quite [similar] to what we saw [in] the historical photos," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan told RTHK that the ball-shaped shapehangers felt better on the hand compared to the red-coloured handles used on other trains.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday hailed a cooperation project between Hong Kong and Thailand aimed at promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and green transport in the Southeast Asian country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony to kick off a partnership between the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) and Thai energy company Spark, Chan said that while the SAR is not known for mass EV production, its tech community is able to create innovative solutions for the vehicles and other new energy applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is proud to assist Thailand in its green transformation, using cutting-edge technologies developed by our tech firms, and contributing our know-how, innovation, expertise and experience,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This high-profile, international project is a brilliant showcase of our green technological capabilities. It reinforces Hong Kong's aspirations and prospects to become an international green tech and green finance centre.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the partnership is only the beginning of more collaborations with Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in the green, smart mobility field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC’s CEO Clara Chan noted that the investment is the corporation’s first overseas initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government-owned investment vehicle aspires to help Spark become one of the top three EV charging brands in Thailand by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To recap, as patient capital, the HKIC has been carrying out due mandate, namely to seek reasonable financial return over the medium to long term, and more importantly, to enhance the long term competitiveness and economic vitality of Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clara Chan said the HKIC's investments have been focused on a diversified range of fields, including core technology, biotechnology, new energy and green technology, spanning companies at various stages of development and from around the world.

 Tickets to local demonstrations by mainland Olympians who did well at the Paris Games were all snapped up in a little more than half an hour on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were some 5,000 tickets available for the public to go to two demonstrations on August 31, and a gala show the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The events are part of a three-day visit by the delegation to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people joined an online queue for the HK$20 tickets when they went on sale at 10am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two demonstrations, at Victoria Park Swimming Pool and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, will feature divers, swimmers, gymnasts, as well as table tennis and badminton players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said those who bought the tickets need to collect them at URBTIX outlets or from self-service ticketing kiosks on or before August 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After departing Hong Kong, members of the national team will spend three days in Macau.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England trailed Sri Lanka by 214 runs on day one of the first test after bad light stopped play on Wednesday at Old Trafford where the tourists' decision to bat first backfired when they were all out for 236.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and opted to bat under cloudy skies but his side were three down for six runs after seven overs before he led their recovery efforts with a confident knock of 74 in the middle order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were 22 for no loss in four overs with Ben Duckett and Dan Lawrence at the crease. Sri Lanka, who were unable to get their fast bowlers to use the new ball in fading light, opted to walk off with a few minutes left until stumps.

  "I think it's a good day. When you bowl on day one on a test surface like that, to be batting at the end of the day I think you're really happy," said England's Chris Woakes, who took 3-32.

  With a hard pitch offering assistance for England's seam attack in the first innings, Sri Lanka's openers were stifled early on as the bowlers dominated the opening session to reduce the visitors to 80-5 at lunch.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca insisted Wednesday he was not presiding over a "mess" of a squad after the London club were involved in yet more transfer activity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  João Felix signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge, with his return from Atletico Madrid to the club where he spent an underwhelming spell on loan in the 2022-23 season helping facilitate Conor Gallagher's move in the opposite direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca now has one of the largest squads in the Premier League at his disposal, although he has made it clear Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are not part of his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking ahead of Chelsea's Conference League play-off against Servette, Maresca said criticism of the club's transfer policy had been unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not working with 42 players, I am working with 21 players in first-team training," the Italian said. "It's not a mess like it looks from outside. The other players can even have 20 years contract, it is not my point. I don't care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the position of Sterling and Chilwell, he added: "In this moment, they are training apart from the squad. As I said, the situation with both of them is quite clear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a big squad, for me it's impossible to give everyone minutes so if they're looking for minutes, probably it is better to leave. And in case they don't leave, they have a contract here, they are Chelsea players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he was understandably more upbeat about João Felix, with Maresca – whose side started the new Premier League season with a 2-0 defeat by champions Manchester City last weekend, saying: "He is a good player, a talent. The club already knows him from two years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He can play different positions with us, inside, as a nine, outside," he added.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street edged up on optimism over possible interest rate cuts. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767130_1_20240822045304.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Wednesday following solid earnings from big-box retailer Target and Federal Reserve meeting minutes that hinted at an upcoming interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Target – Walmart's smaller, North American-focused rival – soared more than 11 percent after reporting higher comparable store sales in its second quarter after a string of declines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, futures markets continued to bet on a September interest rate cut following Fed meeting minutes in which a "vast majority" of policy makers expressed support for an interest rate cut if economic data plays out as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones ended up 0.1 percent at 40,890.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,620, while Nasdaq rose 0.6 percent to 17,918.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed minutes were "dovish and though they're dated, they suggest the debate is not whether the central bank cuts interest rate at its upcoming September meeting but rather how aggressive the initial phase of this normalization cycle should be," said a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interest rate cuts are expected in light of a weaker US jobs market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Department figures released on Wednesday showed US employers added around 68,000 fewer jobs monthly in the 12-month period through March 2024 compared with earlier estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Ford climbed 1.5 percent despite announcing US$1.9 billion in costs connected to shifts in its electric vehicle strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automaker scuttled plans for one new EV model and pushed back the timeframe on a second vehicle in light of a slower-than-expected transition to EVs in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com, the Chinese online retail company, fell 4.2 percent after disclosing that Walmart divested its shares in the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among retailers reporting Wednesday, TJ Maxx parent TJX jumped 6.1 percent while Macy's slumped 13 percent. (AFP)
