<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s military on Friday said it had fired warnings shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who temporarily crossed the demarcation line between the two countries for the third time this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers while engaging in unspecified construction work on the northern side of the border briefly intruded the military demarcation line that bisects the countries at around 11am on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean military in response broadcast a warning and fired warning shots, to which the North Korean soldiers retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint chiefs didn't immediately release more details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s military has said it believes the previous two border intrusions this month
  <br/>
  weren’t intentional as the North Korean soldiers retreated after the warning shots and the North did not returned fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South’s military said it had been observing increased North Korean construction activity in front-line border areas since April, such as installing suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforcing roads and planting land mines. (AP)

 Hong Kong stocks fell at the opening on Friday following a tepid performance on Wall Street, even as data pointed to a slowdown in the US economy that provided the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Official data released on Friday showed the number of bankruptcy petitions in Hong Kong had risen to the highest level in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to figures by the Official Receiver’s Office, there were 871 bankruptcy petitions in May, 17 percent higher on a monthly basis, and 35 percent higher from a year ago, while marking the highest number since April 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of bankruptcy orders by the court, however, significantly dropped last month, standing at 624.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was nearly 27 percent less compared with April when it hit a three-year high, and nine percent lower year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also received 61 compulsory winding-up petitions in May, eight percent lower than April, but 85 percent higher from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also 43 winding-up orders by the court last month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kwong Wah Hospital said a malfunction in the backup power system for the operating theatres was the main cause of a power disruption on Wednesday evening that affected 25 non-urgent surgeries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty-three elective surgeries scheduled on Thursday had to be postponed and two other elective surgeries were moved to other operating rooms, the hospital said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that while the main power supply was working fine, it had decided to shut down eight operating theatres as a precaution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Preliminary investigation by the contractor who installed the electricity supply system revealed that there was a malfunction of the control components in the uninterrupted power supply system which is the third tier backup power supply source and this malfunction affected the operation of the third tier backup power supply system in the operating theatres," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Affected by the incident, 23 elective surgeries originally scheduled for [Thursday] needed to be postponed and two elective surgeries needed to be transferred to another unaffected operating theatres. The two surgeries were both performed uneventfully.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson said that the contractor had replaced the faulty components in the system and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department was conducting independent tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the affected surgeries were expected to gradually resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital added the patient who was moved to another theatre when the outage happened on Wednesday had a complication, but it said that was not related to being moved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Serbian football association threatened to pull the team out of the European Championship over chants made during Wednesday's draw between Albania and Croatia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jovan Surbatovic, the General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia [FSS], told Serbian broadcaster RTS that the country demanded action from authorities over remarks made during the match, including the chant: "Kill, kill, kill the Serb".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surbatovic told RTS the FSS would seek sanctions from UEFA "even at the cost of not continuing the competition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, UEFA, the governing body of European football, said it has opened a probe into the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An ethics and disciplinary inspector has been appointed to "conduct an investigation regarding potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct by supporters" during the match, a statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A probe has also been opened in "relation to the alleged inappropriate behaviour of the Albanian Football Association [FSHF] player Mirlind Daku", the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian media reported that Daku initiated vulgar chants against Serbs and Macedonians. (AFP)

 World champions Argentina opened their bid for back-to-back Copa America titles with a 2-0 win over Canada in front of a 70,564 crowd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez put Argentina ahead in the 49th minute but a combination of inspired goalkeeping from Canada's Max Crepeau and Lionel Messi's surprising lack of precision in front of goal ensured that the underdogs were in the game until Lautaro Martinez settled the contest in the 88th minute.

    Eric Chan says skilled worker policies bearing fruit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan said government policies to attract skilled workers were bearing fruit, with the number far exceeding the 35,000 annual target set by the chief executive. Chan said about 120,000 people had already moved here through different migration schemes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary was speaking in an interview with RTHK to mark the second anniversary of the current administration's term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past year or so, we've successfully attracted over 300,000 applications. If we include the applicants' family members, we estimate some 700,000 people will come to the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are all talents. Frankly, they're voting with their feet, showing their confidence in Hong Kong. I believe this shows our outstanding advantages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development said Hong Kong had risen to fifth in its competitiveness ranking with Chan saying this was proof that, in the eyes of the international community, the SAR was gradually moving forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said he thought people making cross-border leisure trips to Shenzhen was a form of patriotic education, especially for the young.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot hard sell patriotism. It must be a soft sell - through things like exhibitions, movies, music, interviews and visits - for young people to genuinely feel that the country's improved," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So many people go north of the border to consume nowadays. This is also a form of patriotic education, because once they go north to have a look, they can know more about the country and its improvements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary said, ultimately, patriotism needs to become "a mainstream core value".

    Think-tanks call for more support for entrepreneurs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A researcher with the Our Hong Kong Foundation says young SAR entrepreneurs in Guangzhou need more work experience. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758386_1_20240621091224.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Think-tanks are urging Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more training and job placements to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move comes after a research team from the Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation visited two entrepreneurial bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou in September. They were set up to support young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kynita Wong is the foundation's assistant researcher, who travelled to Guangzhou with the team. Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, she said one of the challenges was that the centres were offering services that were too similar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From our visit to entrepreneur bases we observed there's a tendency towards homogeneity. And because the services offered are pretty similar, the convergence of the bases make it difficult for the young entrepreneurs to choose suitable incubation centres," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And also because the entrepreneur bases are relying on the rental and service fees so they provide more of a basic service but not much of an investment function."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said these challenges hindered the ability of the entrepreneurs to fully capitalise on the opportunities available in Guangzhou, which was why they are asking for more support from authorities on both sides of the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first one that we recommend to provide is the short-term employment skills training in related industries to help youth acquire the relevant skills and experience," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are trying to propose the use of the 'employment first, entrepreneurship later' model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said during their training, the young entrepreneurs would gain a better understanding of society on the mainland and this would help them to create networks.

    Lakers to bring in JJ Redick as new head coach

<div class="itemFullText">
 J.J. Redick, an NBA television analyst for ESPN, has agreed to a four-year deal to become the new head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, ESPN reported Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Redick, 39, played 15 seasons in the NBA but has no prior coaching experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That didn't matter to the Lakers, who reportedly made Redick their top target after UConn coach Dan Hurley rejected a six-year, $70 million offer to leave the college ranks – where he is a two-time reigning national champion – for Hollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Redick co-hosts a basketball podcast with Lakers star LeBron James, launched last March. James is due to become a free agent at the start of the new league year but can opt into a $51.4 million player option to stay in Los Angeles.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain secured a spot in the knockout stages of Euro 2024 with a 1-0 victory over Italy in their heavyweight clash on Thursday, after England struggled to show their credentials in a 1-1 draw with Denmark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three-time winners Spain got the better of reigning champions Italy at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen as Riccardo Calafiori bundled the ball into his own net 10 minutes after half-time to decide the encounter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second win in as many matches for Spain is enough for them to secure top spot in Group B with a game to spare, meaning they already know they will play their last-16 tie in Cologne on June 30 against one of the best third-place finishers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy, meanwhile, are not through yet but a point against Croatia in Leipzig on Monday will clinch second place in the group for Luciano Spalletti's team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sides were meeting at a fifth consecutive European Championship and Spain should have won by a far greater margin as they sought revenge for a defeat on penalties in the semi-finals at Wembley three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made several key saves while Lamine Yamal came close from distance in the second half for La Roja and the outstanding Nico Williams smashed a shot off the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, England could have secured a last-16 spot as well as they took on Denmark in Frankfurt in Group C but produced an underwhelming performance that leaves more questions over their chances of becoming European champions for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of the Euro 2020 semi-final won by England, it was Gareth Southgate's men who got off to a perfect start when Harry Kane slotted home after Kyle Walker caught Danish defender Victor Kristiansen napping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark, though, were worthy of at least a point and got it thanks to a spectacular strike by Morten Hjulmand before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Foden hit the post for England and Denmark's Andreas Christensen came close to a late winner in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a share of the spoils leaves all to play for in the final games of Group C next Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's other match in Group C also ended in a 1-1 draw, as Luka Jovic snatched a point for Serbia in the 95th minute to hold Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zan Karnicnik had headed Slovenia in front 21 minutes from time in Munich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Serbia kept their fate of reaching the last 16 in their own hands when AC Milan striker Jovic headed in a corner with virtually the last action of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England top the group on four points, two clear of Denmark and Slovenia, and just need a draw when they face Slovenia in Cologne to be sure of qualifying. (AFP)

    UK's Sunak angered over election gambling probes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beleaguered Rishi Sunak faced questions over the gambling scandal on a BBC programme. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758374_1_20240621052318.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Thursday he was "incredibly angry" after more Conservative Party figures were put under investigation over alleged bets placed on the UK general election date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Facing questions on the growing scandal from an audience of voters on live television, the beleaguered leader said any election candidates or officials found to have broken rules would be kicked out of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came hours after the Conservatives' campaign director stepped aside following reports that he and his wife, a Tory candidate in the July 4 election, were under investigation by betting regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, another would-be MP, Craig Williams, who was a Sunak ministerial aide, was also being probed for staking £100 (US$127) on the date before it was called.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London police said on Wednesday that one of the prime minister's police security detail had been arrested for allegedly placing a bet on the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was incredibly angry... to learn of these allegations," Sunak said of the cases involving his party officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Conservatives confirmed earlier that campaign director Tony Lee had started "a leave of absence" and that the Gambling Commission was looking into "a number of individuals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regulator did not name individuals but the BBC reported that Lee and his election candidate wife Laura Saunders were under investigation. Her lawyers said she would "be co-operating with the Gambling Commission" and claimed the report infringed her privacy rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission had already said it was looking at the claims regarding Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Political bets are allowed in the UK, including on the date of elections, but using insider knowledge to do so is against the law. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday, as market bellwether Nvidia retreated from earlier gains, while investors evaluated recent economic data and commentary from Federal Reserve officials to determine the timing of interest-rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the S&P 500 hit the crucial 5,500-point mark for the first time ever, a year-end target multiple brokerages had forecast. Nasdaq ended a seven-session streak of record closing highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Nvidia dropped 3.54 percent after rising earlier in the session. The chipmaker dethroned Microsoft on Tuesday to become the most valuable public company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dell and Super Micro Computer also declined 0.42 percent and 0.26 percent respectively after an initial increase, following news that they received server orders for Elon Musk's AI startup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined last week, but the latest data showed that the overall number of people on benefits rolls reached the highest level since January, indicating that the US job market continues to cool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another set of data showed US single-family homebuilding fell in May amid continued high mortgage rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The news that we got today was just another negative weakness in the economy”, said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta. “In the employment report, you're getting those (unemployment) claims that are not terrible, but it's.. getting into a territory that's not low necessarily anymore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said it would take a year or two to get inflation back to 2 percent, as wage growth might still be too high, spurring worries of interest rates staying elevated for longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.77 percent, to 39,135, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 percent, to 5,473 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.79 percent, to 17,722.

    Deadly heatwaves on four continents as summer begins

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Record temperatures in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across Asia and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius, according to reports from foreign authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Countries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40C this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat. But New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C at 1am. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in films such as "M*A*S*H," "Klute," "Ordinary People" and the "Hunger Games" films, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tall actor with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and mischievous smile managed to switch effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads, opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included a rascally Army surgeon in "M*A*S*H" (1970), a quirky tank commander in "Kelly's Heroes" (1970), a small-town detective in "Klute" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in "Animal House" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1978) and a despairing father in "Ordinary People" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in "The Hunger Games" (2012) and its sequels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life," Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017. (Reuters)

    Putin says he may change nuclear weapons doctrine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia was thinking about possible changes to its doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The existing doctrine states that Russia may use such weapons in response to a nuclear attack or in the event of a conventional attack that poses an existential threat to the state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the war in Ukraine, some hawks among Russian military analysts have been advocating that Russia should lower its threshold for nuclear use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said, however, that there was no need for Russia to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was speaking to reporters a day after visiting nuclear-armed North Korea for a summit with its leader, Kim Jong Un. The two leaders signed a treaty under which each side promised to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against either one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian state media quoted Putin as saying that Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to use North Korean soldiers in the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also said he did not rule out Russia supplying high-precision weapons to North Korea. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian President Klaus Iohannis withdrew from the race to lead Nato on Thursday, clearing the way for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to become the next secretary-general of the transatlantic military alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All other Nato members had already backed Rutte, a staunch ally of Ukraine and outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to take over from Jens Stoltenberg, who is stepping down this year after a decade in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the war in Ukraine on Nato's doorstep and European nations concerned about the possible return of Nato-critical Donald Trump to the White House, alliance members concluded the highly experienced Rutte was the best person for the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As it announced Iohannis's decision, Romania's supreme defence council said it would donate one of the country's two operational Patriot systems to Ukraine, responding to pleas from Kyiv to its allies for more air defence assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Romania's decision "will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme council, which is chaired by Iohannis, said the president had informed Nato last week of his decision to withdraw and Romania would now support Rutte's candidacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all 32 Nato members now backing the Dutchman, diplomats said they expected the alliance's governing North Atlantic Council to formally select him for the post in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia, while guarding against any escalation that could draw Nato directly into a war with Moscow. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested 84 people in a three-day operation targeting the illegal use of electric mobility devices in northern New Territories.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 17 and 76, were nabbed on suspicion of various offences, such as driving an unregistered vehicle, driving without a licence, and using a vehicle without third-party insurance. All of them have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers also seized 69 electric bikes and 15 e-scooters. Around one-third of them were allegedly used for food delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting chief inspector Ngai Siu-cheong also noted that the battery-propelled devices were commonly used by parents with young children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that many parents would use these electric mobility devices to drop off or pick up their children from school and for daily commute. Some even modified their electric bikes by adding more seats. In some cases, the parents would carry two to three kids on one bicycle," Ngai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the speed of such powered devices could reach up to 50 kilometres per hour. Many arrested parents did not have a valid driving licence either, meaning they could not properly follow the signs and rules, endangering other road users.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Days of torrential rain, flash floods and landslides across southern China have forced authorities to enact emergency plans, as swollen rivers threaten to overflow further, potentially disrupting the lives of millions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Guangdong upgraded an emergency response plan for disasters like landslides and flooding to the second-highest level, helping to coordinate and deploy resources across the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other provinces have already activated a Level-IV emergency response for flood control as this year's flooding season kicked into high gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain and landslides in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have already killed at least nine people and left several people missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Guilin, a major city in Guangxi in southwest China, raised a "red" flood warning signal, the highest level, late on Wednesday when the water level of the Li River, which runs through the city, reached 3.61 metres above the warning line, China Daily reported on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The water level at the river's hydrological station in Rongjiang township hit a record high, threatening residents' lives and properties along the river, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guilin authorities urged departments, townships and scenic spots to help prevent and combat possible flooding in the coming days as water levels at major rivers continue to rise, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate to heavy rain is expected to start again from Friday through Monday in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest waterway in Asia, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's jobless rate stood unchanged at three percent in the three-month period ending in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.2 percent, compared with 1.1 percent in the February-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday showed that about 2,500 people became jobless during the latest period, taking the tally to 116,200, while the number of underemployed people rose by 4,200 to 44,700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable increases in the underemployment rate were observed in sectors including decoration, repair, building maintenance, cleaning, arts, entertainment and recreation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total employment, meanwhile, increased by about 2,800 to about 3.69 million, and the labour force also increased by about 5,300 to 3.81 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest data, Labour Secretary Chris Sun said the jobless rate remained low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the city's labour market "should stay tight in the near term alongside the continued economic growth".

    Hong Kong embraces ethnic diversity: Eric Chan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan says the government has enhanced support for ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=25&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758296_1_20240620162803.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong was a metropolis that embraced ethnic diversity, amid calls for more support for minorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony unveiling the Diversity List, which honoured 21 people with an ethnic minority background for their contributions to the city, Chan said the government had enhanced support for minorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chief Executive, in his Policy Address last year, expanded the government's support for our ethnic minority communities in education, employment, integration into the community and support services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That includes setting up two additional support service centres. Eight ethnic minority care teams will begin service next month, with two others expected to be in place by year’s end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shalini Mahtani, the founder and the CEO of The Zubin Foundation, an NGO which aims to improve the lives of marginalised communities in the city, urged the government to include ethnic minorities in the campaign of "telling the good stories of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To ask the government to use multi-ethnic faces and stories to tell the Hong Kong stories. Because there are so many great stories in this community, and to use these faces and these stories both locally and internationally," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Diversity List, which was launched by The Zubin Foundation, featured 21 people from seven ethnic groups and across a wide range of expertise, such as financial services, legal services and education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong-born Saajandeep Singh, who was one of the honourees and an admitted solicitor in the SAR, called on the government to increase the number of ethnic minorities on its care teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the government can always offer more support. They are doing great initiatives at the moment, but obviously they will need to provide more funding to ensure that these programmes continue and they are far-reaching, and they are not only in specific areas of Hong Kong, but they are district-wide," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that they have ethnic minority care teams nowadays, but I think they will need a greater number of people involved in these teams."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a series of deals with his Vietnamese counterpart To Lam during a state visit that comes as Moscow sought to bolster ties in Asia to offset growing international isolation over its military actions in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two signed agreements to further cooperation on education, science and technology, energy, climate change and health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Strengthening a comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam is always one of our priorities,” said Putin, according to Russian news agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived at Vietnam’s Presidential Palace on Thursday afternoon, where he was greeted by school children waving Russian and Vietnamese flags. There he shook hands with and embraced Vietnam’s new President To Lam before a bilateral meeting and a joint briefing to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived in Hanoi early Thursday morning from North Korea, where he and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed an agreement that pledged mutual aid in the event of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strategic pact could mark the strongest connection between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War and comes as both face escalating standoffs with the West. (AP)

    University tuition fees to rise 17.6% over three years
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tuition fees at public universities will increase by HK$2,400 next year, with further rises of around the same amount planned for each of the following two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After an almost three-decade-long freeze in annual fees, the current HK$42,100 charge for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will rise to HK$44,500 in 2025/26, HK$47,000 in 2026/27 and HK$49,500 in 2027/28 – an increase of almost 17.6 percent over the three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For sub-degree programmes, the current HK$15,040 will reach HK$17,800 by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson on Thursday said the administration is working to strike a balance between maintaining its fiscal discipline and ensuring that higher education remains affordable for students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the last tuition fees adjustment in the 1997/98 academic year, the Composite Consumer Price Index has increased by 40 percent cumulatively. Comparatively, the tuition fees adjustment is very modest this time," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The UGC-funded universities provide other financial assistance such as scholarships, bursaries and loans to needy students to ensure that no qualified students will be denied access to higher education due to financial difficulties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration also said its target cost recovery rate for tuition fee levels of 18 percent, set in the early 1990s, had been declining due to more expenditure being needed to deliver higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate is projected to drop to 12.5 percent in the next academic year, before improving slightly in 2027 to 13.4 percent following the tuition fee increases, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan stressed that the decision to put up fees has nothing to do with the government's budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't adjusted the tuition fee for more than 20 years, so we believe there is a need to moderately adjust the tuition fee. Our goal is to subsidise students with 82 percent of their tuition fee, but we are above this target," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our plan is to increase the fees in the upcoming three years. We don't have any plan to increase the fees after three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation welcomed the move, while calling for more support for students from lower-income families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 5.5 percent [average annual increase] is somewhat mild, because we are talking about inflation of about two to three percent. We are just slightly above that, trying to catch up a little bit, in terms of the cost recovery," said Victor Kwok, the group's assistant research director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously, on the other hand, as they gradually increase the tuition fees, they also have to proportionally increase their support, in terms of students loans, and in terms of student grants, for students from relatively less well-off families."

    Miniature art exhibition to showcase HK landmarks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A miniature artist on Thursday said that an exhibition showcasing unique Central and Western District landmarks would deepen people's understanding of Hong Kong's rich history and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Look Closer and Wonder: Central and Western District in Miniature" exhibition will display 22 artworks, with nine pieces new to the collection, in celebration of the 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Poon, president of the Joyful Miniature Association, hoped the artworks could give people a fresh perspective of familiar sites in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Central and Western District is very unique. First of all, because it is the heart of Hong Kong's political, economic, financial centre and it's also a cultural centre. From this area, you can see the earliest transportation, colonial architecture and also in terms of food, for example, you have cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong style cafe) and you also have a lot of declared monuments like the Man Mo Temple," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, you have the most classic and oldest [buildings], and on the other hand, you have the highest skyscrapers all at once. It's a melting pot of East meets West. You have Lan Kwai Fong out there, it's the gist of Hong Kong, everything that is the best is here, in Central and Western District."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One artist Hung Fai-chan spent a year recreating the corridors of an old public housing estate called "We All Grew Up Like This". He said he wanted to capture the memories of childhood games, before electronics, that many Hong Kong people grew up with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of my own memories inside this piece too because I also grew up in public housing. I have a few siblings myself so I wanted to capture the childhood games we used to play, like rock, paper, scissors up the stairs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also simpler games like marble shooting or even table tennis on the ground. These are all the games we would play as a child, like many children in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another artist Tim Ho worked with a team to recreate the Man Mo Temple in Sheung Wan. He said the project was challenging given its meticulous craftsmanship that took numerous site visits and extensive research to create the replica. He added the temple is an iconic landmark, so he hoped a lot of tourists would admire their artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want people to see that it is no different from the actual Man Mo Temple. We tried our best to really capture all the details of the temple. We want people to know that there is such a beautiful piece of architecture in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of our artwork is that it captures an angle you can't see fully in real life. It is usually crowded at the temple so you can't see it when it is empty. You also can't see all the little details. You will see the entire structure from a giant's perspective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition will be held in Admiralty from June 21 to July 8.

    Hundreds of Hajj pilgrims feared dead amid heatwave

<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomats from Arab nations on Thursday said hundreds of people had died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced intense high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports were conflicting, but unofficial accounts suggested that at least 500 people had died during the Hajj pilgrimage, with some saying the death toll was likely higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over two million people travel to Saudi Arabia. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage’s history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the high temperatures and intense heat made things especially treacherous for pilgrims this year, with temperatures hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Think tanks on Thursday urged Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more assistance to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation said that as of July 2023, there were 52 entrepreneurial bases in Guangzhou for young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau, with about 2,100 start-up projects underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A research team from the two groups visited two bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou and talked to about 10 Hong Kong entrepreneurs working in various industries there, including arts and culture, technology and catering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s assistant research director, Victor Kwok, said some Hong Kong startups there lack knowledge about the business environment and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are gaps that we observe, such as the difference between the skills, knowledge, experiences and the network of the entrepreneurs and the actual requirements of actually having the business to prosper,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok highlighted challenges arising from changes in rules and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We all know comparatively in the mainland, the policy change is sometimes faster than what is observed in Hong Kong, and that could be a challenge, because sometimes you apply for funding and then the policy itself expires before you actually get the funding,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok said a single, easy-to-use government application or website would be beneficial for entrepreneurs to keep themselves updated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incubators in Guangzhou should also be more proactive in assisting startups to apply for funding from the mainland government, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation and coalition also complained that all the entrepreneurial bases offer identical services. They said authorities should differentiate them based on the startups’ development stage or industry type, making it easier for entrepreneurs to connect with the right industry players.

    CUHK develops mRNA drug for nasopharyngeal cancer

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists at Chinese University on Thursday said they had developed a new drug that had the potential to cause nasopharyngeal cancer cells to destroy themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drug uses mRNA bio-technology, which acts like a code to activate the death cycle of cancer cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scientists carried out tests on mice and said the results were very promising. They described the drug as a "smart bomb" because it not only targets cancer cells, but also attracts immune cells to help eliminate them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Anne Tsang, one of the researchers, said this new drug is better than current treatments because it could minimise damage to healthy cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All the traditional treatments are mostly systemic. They are chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and so they affect not only the cancer cells, but also the other normal cells," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For our drug, this drug mechanism will only target the cancer cells that are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus. So the normal cells will be safe...and so our human body will feel [many fewer] side effects, and so the patients can have a much better quality of life."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the throat, specifically the part that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It is often called "Canton cancer" because it is more common in southern China.

    Health minister concerned about hospital power outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau on Thursday said the hardware of all hospitals needs to be of very high quality, to ensure that patients receive proper treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came after a power outage lasting almost an hour at Kwong Wah Hospital on Wednesday night. The redeveloped building was only completed last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff carrying out surgery had to move to another room, while 25 other operations were rescheduled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said there will be a probe into what exactly went wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The quality of construction works and hardware indeed affects our medical services. The Hospital Authority and the hospital will investigate to find out what the problems were technically," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said the problem could be the fault of builders. After the hospital building opened last year, issues with electricity cables were discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not expect a new hospital to have a general power outage problem like that," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that is a systematic problem with the engineering system, or the monitoring system while the building was being constructed, then I believe that's a big issue."

 Phil Salt blasted an unbeaten 87 as defending champions England cruised to an eight-wicket victory over the West Indies in their T20 World Cup Super Eight clash in St. Lucia on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opening batsman Salt smashed seven fours and five sixes during a superb 47-ball knock at the Daren Sammy National Stadium as England made a flying start to the second round of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After restricting West Indies to 180-4 off their 20 overs, Salt's knock steered England home with a winning total of 181-2 off 17.3 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having squeaked into the second stage on net run rate, England will take a huge boost of confidence from beating one of the in-form teams at the tournament to top Group 2 with South Africa, who they meet at the same ground on Friday. (Agencies)

    Rule of law intact despite judges leaving: SJ

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice chief Paul Lam said the recent resignations of overseas non-permanent judges from Hong Kong's top court would not undermine the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two UK judges – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Jonathan Sumption – resigned from the Court of Final Appeal earlier this month, and Beverley McLachlin from Canada said she would not stay on when her term expires at the end of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, the secretary for justice said foreign legal experts were still confident in the SAR's judicial system, noting that two other overseas judges had joined the bench since the implementation of the national security law in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's normal for people to come and go. So, don't just focus on people leaving. There are also judges who are extending their terms and new judges who are joining," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the departure of the three judges, seven non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions remain at the Court of Final Appeal. The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there is no quota on the number of overseas non-permanent judges sitting on the top court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Basic Law does not state that there must be eight or 10 non-permanent overseas judges on the court over a long period of time. I think quality is the most important. We are not looking at the numbers. In fact, we invite judges who are internationally prestigious and can help Hong Kong develop what is called jurisprudence, which is the quality of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrests made by the police in the past month over the publishing of social media posts ahead of a "sensitive date" for alleged sedition under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, Lam said the government is not targetting specific dates but the intention of an act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No matter what day or time it is, if your behaviour constitutes a crime with an incitement intent, then there's a risk you will be charged. We are targetting the words and actions. It doesn't matter what day. The day you come out and say you support 'Hong Kong independence' or want to subvert state power, there's a chance you violate the law," he said.

 Zhang Zhizhen on Wednesday became the first Chinese man to reach the quarter-finals of the Halle grass-court tournament with a three-set win over fifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev of Russia.

  The world number 42 came through 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 [7/5] after winning the last four points of the deciding tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A really tough match. Last time I lost a third-set tie-break [in Stuttgart last week]. And today again, a third-set tie-break," said the 27-year-old Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was thinking, 'Okay, it's time. The perfect moment to get revenge'," Zhang told atptour.com.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt like it was good tennis and I'm happy to be in the quarters."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa beat the United States by 18 runs in the first T20 World Cup Super 8 game in Antigua on Wednesday as Kagiso Rabada's experience came to the fore at the end of a tense game.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Having struggled on New York's slow pitches in the group stage, South Africa scored freely at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, posting 194-4 on the back of Quinton de Kock's fine knock of 74.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, U.S. opener Andries Gous [80 not out] provided the fireworks along with Harmeet Singh [38] down the order but fast bowler Rabada picked up crucial wickets in his spell of 3-18 and restricted the run rate as the U.S. fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The U.S. had won the toss and opted to field first, picking up the wicket of Reeza Hendricks early but De Kock cut loose as South Africa scored at over 10 runs per over during the powerplay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Kock reached his fifty in 26 balls and shared a 110-run partnership with skipper Aiden Markram off 60 deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harmeet Singh dismissed De Kock when he mistimed a full toss and was caught near the boundary and the all-rounder was on a hat-trick when he had David Miller caught and bowled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markram fell four runs short of his fifty when he chased a wide loose ball and Ali Khan took a sharp diving catch to give Saurabh Netravalkar his second wicket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Netravalkar's superb spell [2-21], the others failed to contain South Africa as Heinrich Klaasen dealt in sixes and scored a quick-fire 36 in an unbroken 53-run partnership with Tristan Stubbs [20] to propel them to 194-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American opener Steven Taylor [24] underlined his intent when he smashed a boundary off the first ball, but after four fours and a six, he fell to Rabada when a mistimed shot was caught at mid-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fast bowler also dismissed Nitish Kumar, who was caught at deep square leg, and U.S. captain Aaron Jones fell for a duck to spinner Keshav Maharaj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gous continued to resist, bringing up his fifty with back-to-back sixes, but the required run rate continued to climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was hope when Shamsi went for 22 runs in an expensive 18th over but Rabada returned to dismiss Harmeet, conceding only two runs in the penultimate over. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's volleyball team will face host nation France, defending Olympic champions the United States and reigning world champions Serbia in the first stage of the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China's team is eyeing a rebound from its worst ever Olympic performance in Tokyo last time, where the three-time Olympic champions were eliminated in the first stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Paris Olympics will be China's 11th consecutive Olympic appearance in women's volleyball since their debut in Los Angeles in 1984, when they also won gold for the first time, before also standing atop the Olympic podium at Athens 2004 and Rio 2016, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12 qualified teams for Paris were drawn into three pools of four at Wednesday's drawing ceremony in Bangkok, ahead of the FIVB Women's Volleyball Nations League [VNL] Finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from France, the United States, China and Serbia in Pool A, Brazil, Poland, Japan and Kenya were drawn into Pool B, while Italy, Türkiye, the Netherlands and the Dominican Republic are in Pool C. The pool winners, the pool runners-up and the two best-ranked third-placed teams will advance to the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic volleyball tournament at Paris 2024 will take place from July 27 to August 11 at the South Paris Arena in the French capital. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hosts Germany became the first team to qualify for the knockout phase of Euro 2024 on Wednesday thanks to a 2-0 win over Hungary, while Scotland drew with Switzerland and Croatia's hopes of progressing were left hanging in the balance after they were held by Albania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany followed up their 5-1 demolition of Scotland in the tournament's opening game by seeing off the Hungarians in Stuttgart, with Jamal Musiala and Ilkay Gundogan scoring either side of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Nagelsmann's team have a maximum six points with one game still to come in Group A, and are certain to progress to the last 16 at least as runners-up in the section.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary put up a fight but the hosts had too much quality in the final third, with Bayern Munich star Musiala firing in the opener midway through the first half after captain Gundogan refused to give up a lost cause in the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany then doubled their lead on 67 minutes as Gundogan, of Barcelona, swept home an assist by Maximilian Mittelstaedt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their recent struggles appear to be a thing of the past, and Germany have now won their opening two games at a World Cup or European Championship for the first time since Euro 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's hopes of progressing now hang by a thread, while group rivals Switzerland and Scotland played out a 1-1 stalemate in Wednesday's late match in Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland, backed by a large and noisy support, went ahead early on when Callum McGregor cut the ball back for Scott McTominay to score with a shot that went in via a big touch off Fabian Schaer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Switzerland equalised when Xherdan Shaqiri pounced on a stray pass by Anthony Ralston to smash a superb first-time strike high into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss saw Dan Ndoye miss a glorious second-half opportunity and Breel Embolo have a goal disallowed for offside, but Scotland deserved the draw which keeps their hopes alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They might even have won the game, with Grant Hanley hitting the post from a late header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland, quarter-finalists at Euro 2020, may already have enough points to progress but a draw against Germany on Sunday will make sure of second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland, who have not won a match at a major tournament since beating the Swiss 1-0 at Euro 96, can still qualify with a win over Hungary in Stuttgart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Albania's Klaus Gjasula scored at both ends, including a dramatic injury-time equaliser as his side drew 2-2 with Croatia in Hamburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament. (AFP)

    Louisiana makes Ten Commandments compulsory in classes

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758221_1_20240620063458.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry on Wednesday signed into law a bill that makes the state the only one in the country to require displaying the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American Civil Liberties Union immediately announced it would sue to block the law, saying it violates the constitutional separation of church and state and a US Supreme Court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry signed the bill along with a package of others he said were designed to "expand faith in public schools."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses," Landry said at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Christian and Jewish faiths, God revealed the Ten Commandments to Hebrew prophet Moses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other measures would authorise the hiring of chaplains in schools, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender pupil's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry also signed bills that would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve maths skills, and impose fewer curriculum mandates on teachers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil rights group ACLU and its Louisiana chapter along with Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced they would file a lawsuit to challenge the law that requires a specific text of the Ten Commandments be prominently displayed in all classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other state has such a law, the groups said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools," the statement said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Vietnam early on Thursday for talks with the country's leaders on the final stop of his two-nation tour of Asia after concluding a defence pact with North Korea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin's aircraft touched down at Hanoi's airport, where he was met on a red carpet by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha and top Communist Party diplomat Le Hoai Trung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an opinion piece timed for his visit, Putin applauded the Southeast Asian Communist-ruled country for supporting "a pragmatic way to solve the crisis" in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam, which officially pursues a neutral foreign policy, has abstained from condemning Russia's attack on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as praising Vietnam for its "balanced" stance on the Ukraine war, Putin listed progress on payments, energy and trade between the countries in the article published in Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country is the third nation Putin has visited, after China and North Korea, since he was sworn in for a fifth term in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam has been gearing up for a full state welcome for Putin, his first visit since 2017 and his fifth in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is due to meet Communist Party leader Nguyen Phu Trong, President To Lam and Prime Minster Pham Minh Chinh. (Reuters)

    Nowhere in Israel safe if war erupts: Hezbollah chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and he also threatened Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterannean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza War. On Tuesday, the group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said "there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones" in Israel in the event of a broader war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also had "a bank of targets" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big...In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea," Nasrallah added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war," Nasrallah said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from authorities in Cyprus. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Elizabeth Hospital said on Wednesday it had launched an investigation after a blunder involving a feeding tube that left a patient fighting for his life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said the 61-year-old man was being treated in an orthopaedic ward and required a nasogastric tube to receive formula milk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson said the tube was inserted by a nurse on Sunday at noon and replaced in the evening in accordance with procedures. However, the patient’s condition deteriorated early on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Doctors immediately performed resuscitation and arranged bronchoscopy examination for the patient, where a nasogastric tube was found placed in his bronchus,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patient was taken to the High Dependency Unit before being moved to intensive care. On Wednesday, his condition was said to be critical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The hospital is saddened by the incident,” the spokesperson said. “QEH has met with the patient’s family to explain the incident, extend sincere apologies and express deep empathy. QEH will continue to closely communicate with the patient’s family and provide necessary assistance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority. A panel has been set up to investigate and recommend improvements within eight weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Kwong Wah Hospital said that it had called off 25 elective surgeries scheduled for Thursday after a power cut hit some of its operating theatres on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One surgery had to be moved to a different theatre during the cut, which started at 7pm and lasted for 50 minutes. It’s getting in touch with the affect patients and has apologised. Other services were not affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people, including eight Rohingya Muslims, were killed and several others injured on Wednesday after heavy monsoon rains triggered landslides in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People died in landslides at four separate places in the early hours of Wednesday, Mohammad Shamsud Douza, a senior Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said after days of heavy rain as the monsoon season began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said children and women are among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 1 million Rohingya live in crowded camps in the border district of Cox's Bazar, the world's largest refugee settlement, after fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh weather office said it expected heavy rains to continue for the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rohingya refugees mostly live in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheets, often on steep, bare hills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a terrible situation in the camps due to the rain, even the narrow paths are so slippery and dangerous," Rohingya refugee Mohammed Kamal said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain and the onrush of upstream water from India also left hundreds of thousands of people marooned in the northeastern region of Bangladesh, still recovering from a cyclone that hit the country's coastal belt in the southern part late last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 500,000 people have been affected by the flood in the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj, with water levels surpassing danger levels at six points along four rivers in the region, officials said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environmental protesters sprayed paint on Britain's Stonehenge on Wednesday, with orange marks covering some of the stones of the prehistoric megalithic structure on the eve of the summer solstice celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two people have been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument, police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is extremely upsetting and our curators are investigating the extent of the damage," English Heritage, the charity that manages Stonehenge, said on X. Stonehenge remains open, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monument, one of Britain's most visited tourist spots, also holds spiritual significance and attracts thousands of revellers, spiritualists and tourists during the summer solstice – the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In video released by environmental group Just Stop Oil, two protesters were seen running towards two of Stonehenge's megaliths and spraying paint as another person attempted to stop them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public were able to walk around within the stone circle, located in southern England, until 1977 when it was fenced off due to concerns over damage from a sharp rise in the number of visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just Stop Oil are a disgrace," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on X of the protest at the Unesco World Heritage Site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just Stop Oil has gained prominence in Britain for disruptive environmental protests, with its activists shutting down major roads, disrupting cultural and sporting events and even throwing soup at a Van Gogh painting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group wants the British government to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. (Reuters)

    'Tuition hike moderate but adds to students' burden'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sources say university tuition could go up from five to nine percent each year over three years. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758175_2_20240619205709.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A potential increase in university tuition fees has drawn mixed views from students and lawmakers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government intends to roll out a phased fee increase over the next three years, with annual increments ranging from five to nine percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lucy Ng, a third-year student at the University of Hong Kong, said she wants her school to put the money to good use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a student, of course, I hope the school can keep the current tuition fee. But if our school insists to have this increase, I hope they can explain how they will use this fee. Are they going to build any new facilities?" she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another HKU student, Emily, who majors in social work, said a tuition hike would increase the financial burden on students who rely on loans, such as herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm currently taking the government loan... They are burdened with the loans, so they have to repay in many years when they work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will definitely enhance the financial burden of students, so I don't think it's a very good act for the university to increase tuition fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lau Chi-peng, who’s also Associate Vice-President at Lingnan University, described the proposed increase as moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are two considerations: whether it would impose a burden on students and families, as well as the magnitude of the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears that the increase would be moderate and the process would be gradual. There would also be corresponding adjustments in government financial assistance, which could potentially involve extending the repayment period," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung urged the government to consider the affordability of students and parents before finalising the tuition proposal, to prevent “turning student loans into student debts.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Priscilla Leung of the Business and Professionals Alliance, who chairs Legco's education panel, called on society to accept the increase, in light of the government's budget deficit amounting to billions of dollars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in on Wednesday for a second term in which his African National Congress (ANC) will share power with other parties after it lost its majority for the first time in 30 years of democracy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A former liberation movement, the ANC came to power under Nelson Mandela's leadership in the 1994 elections that marked the end of apartheid and had long been unbeatable, but it lost its shine after presiding over years of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a parliamentary election on May 29 in which no party won a majority, Ramaphosa will head a government of national unity with five other parties, including the ANC's largest rival, the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While investors have welcomed the inclusion of the DA, which wants to boost growth through structural reforms and prudent fiscal policies, analysts said sharp ideological divisions between the parties could make the government unstable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just before the election, Ramaphosa signed into law a National Health Insurance bill that the DA said could collapse the country's health system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear what would happen to that law under the new government. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday announced it had opened a new regional centre in Shanghai to further strengthen its engagement and partnership in the Asia-Pacific region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The opening was announced on the first day of the two-day annual Lujiazui financial forum in the mainland’s financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the IMF said the new centre “will serve as a hub to promote research that can inform policies in areas of interest to emerging market and middle-income countries”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will help deepen the IMF’s dialogue with member countries and other stakeholders in the region, including international financial institutions, academics, think-tanks, CSOs, and the private sector,” the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, it said the new establishment would facilitate targeted capacity-building in the region, including via peer-to-peer learning, in collaboration with the China IMF Capacity Development Centre (CICDC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also expressed gratitude to China’s central bank for its generous financial support to its Shanghai Regional Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre’s launch ceremony, Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said he welcomed the new establishment in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe the Shanghai Regional Centre will deepen cooperation between the IMF and China, enhance macroeconomic policy exchange and coordination among the Asia Pacific countries, and support regional and global financial stability,” Pan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pan, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the same event that the Shanghai centre “will deepen understanding of perspectives from member countries, and foster international economic cooperation”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening of the new centre came after the IMF earlier upgraded its estimate for China’s economic growth for this year from 4.6 percent to five percent last month, putting its projections in line with Beijing’s full-year growth estimate at around five percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildlife officials have captured two wild boars that were spotted wandering around Sham Shui Po on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) used dart guns during the capture operation near Sheung Li Uk Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at around 10.10am when the pigs were seen at the junction of Tai Po Road and Nam Cheong Street, near a petrol station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boars were said to have later moved to the garden, located along Tai Po Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online footage showed police officers at the scene using shields for protection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Considering that the presence of the two wild boars in urban areas would pose a danger to the public, our staff captured and euthanised them,” an AFCD spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia signed a slew of deals on Wednesday, renewing a five-year economic co-operation pact and allowing exports of fresh durians, during a visit by Premier Li Qiang to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work with Malaysia," Li said in a statement, adding that focus areas included development strategies, mutually beneficial co-operation and exchanges to promote the building of a China-Malaysia community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Wednesday's closed-door meeting, Li and Anwar witnessed the signing of more than a dozen pacts on co-operation in areas ranging from the digital economy to green development, housing, tourism and communications, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new five-year pact that runs until 2028 provides for strategic collaboration in areas such as trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, a statement after the meeting showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-year programme was first introduced in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also agreed to allow imports of fresh durian from Malaysia after it meets sanitary requirements, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries also vowed to review visa-free travel arrangements set to expire in coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at US$98.9 billion in 2023.

    Govt moves full steam ahead with new incinerator

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it is working at full speed to get Hong Kong's first mega waste incinerator up and running next year, as it plans to stop using landfills for waste disposal by 2035.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Department led a press tour to a man-made island near Lantau where the incinerator, called I-PARK1, is being built.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Director for Environmental Protection, Michael Lui, said the plant will be able to recover heat energy from the incineration process to generate electricity for 100,000 homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In early next year, we plan to carry out a testing commissioning with a view so that we can operate the plant by the end of next year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we can at least achieve the very important step that we implement the first mega incinerator in Hong Kong to handle at least 3,000 tonnes of waste [each day]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another incinerator, capable of processing about 6,000 tonnes of waste per day, will be built near Tuen Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said construction could be completed two years ahead of schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui said both incinerators will use new technology to ensure that emissions meet international standards and do not harm people's health or the surrounding environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the government's plans, an environmental group said burning garbage should be the last resort, and isn't an alternative to reducing waste and increasing recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said opening two massive incinerators risks sending the wrong message to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said Hong Kong currently disposes of around 11,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste on average per day, and if the goal to gradually reduce the per capita disposal rate by around 45 percent is achieved, the amount would drop to about 6,100 tonnes a day – below the capacity of the two incinerators of 9,000 tonnes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only if the government thinks that their strategy action set out in the Waste Blueprint for Hong Kong 2035 is useless, otherwise the waste generation amount and the waste that requires disposal will be greatly reduced by 45 percent. This is not by the end of the blueprint timeline 2035, if reduced by 45 percent, it is saying very clearly it is a mid-term target," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means by 2026 or 2027, this is a mid-term, then the government can already get the city to achieve this target. So I don't know why the government still needs to propose even the 6,000 tonnes, the second incinerator, which is really overcapacity."

    Lawmakers bemoan 'useless' workplace accident fines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun said there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents since maximum fines for safety law breaches were introduced last year." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758129_1_20240619153422.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies involved in industrial accidents are not being punished strongly enough for safety law breaches despite an increase in the maximum penalty, lawmakers complained on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, the highest penalty for a serious violation of occupational safety laws was raised from a fine of HK$500,000, to HK$10 million and a two-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun said since the law change, there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one case that has concluded, two company bosses were fined HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of lawmakers said such a punishment is too lenient, with president of the Federation of Trade Unions Stanley Ng saying it shows last year's law change is "useless" when it comes to preventing industrial accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said regarding the pair fined HK$50,000, officials decided they would not have a strong case should they decide to appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is considered the sentences were not wrong in principle and the fines were not manifestly inadequate," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that it has only been a little more than a year since the legal changes were made and appealed to lawmakers to wait longer to see what effect the higher punishments have.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that officials will review the matter in around a year's time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government plans to raise university tuition fees over the coming three years, with annual increases of between five and nine percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Education Secretary Christine Choi had previously said it was time to raise the HK$42,100 annual tuition fee for local students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions, as it had remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the increase would be phased in as early as next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the current fee covers only 13 percent of the total cost and the government's target is for the fee to cover 18 percent of the cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi met with some lawmakers to explain the plan, with the government expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Evan Gershkovich will go on trial behind closed door on charges of espionage next week, but Russia has hinted at a possible prisoner swap for the Wall Street Journal reporter. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758132_1_20240619154436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Wednesday said it was waiting for the United States to respond to its proposals for a prisoner swap, a week before reporter Evan Gershkovich was set to face trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The ball is in the court of the United States, we are waiting for them to respond to the ideas that were presented to them," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's state media in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich, a US citizen and a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, has been behind bars since his March 2023 arrest and faces 20 years in prison if convicted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial is to be held in the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, where he was arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich has since been held in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, about 1,400 kilometres to the west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial would be closed to the public, as is usual in espionage cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich is accused of “gathering secret information” on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General’s office said last week in the first details of the accusations against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he believes a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That appeared to be Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will unveil eight measures to reform its five-year-old Nasdaq-style sci-tech board under the Shanghai Stock Exchange to promote the nation's technology and innovation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering a keynote speech at the annual Lujiazui financial forum in Shanghai, Wu Qing, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said reforms of the Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR Market, will also better facilitate the development of new quality productive forces, called for by President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the reforms will cover arrangements related to share offerings, underwriting and mergers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu said technology innovation is at the core of developing new quality productive forces, and long-term investments, or patient capital, shall be further expanded to support the technology and innovation enterprises in the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the CSRC will further ramp up supervision and law enforcement in areas such as high-frequency quantitative trading to protect investors, and will clamp down on financial fraud of listed firms by encouraging whistleblowers to report issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dubbed the “broker butcher”, Wu, who was appointed to chair the commission in February, is known for his forceful measures, including posing curbs on new share offerings and strict punishment for fraudulent listings and accounting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since his appointment, Chinese stocks have seen a rebound, following a three-year decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong stock markets advanced on Wednesday in early trade following his announcements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Pan Gongsheng, the Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said at the same forum that the country’s central bank is studying the implementation of government bond trading, along with the finance ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan noted that such sovereign bond trading will be implemented via a gradual process, and that the pace of sovereign bond sales, term structure, and the custody system will also need to be studied and optimised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed that such practices cannot be equated to quantitative easing, and said they are tools for managing liquidity and injecting base money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There will be both buying and selling [of the sovereign bonds], and it will be combined with other tools to create an accommodative liquidity environment,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank chief also suggested that there is more room to ease monetary policy as other economies are pivoting to cut interest rates this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that Moscow and Pyongyang would sign an agreement that would bolster their ties, and thanked North Korea for supporting the Kremlin's policies in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the start of his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Russian leader said in remarks carried by Russian state media that the “new fundamental document will form the basis of our ties for a long perspective.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also hailed a “close friendship” between the two countries based on “equality and respect of mutual interests,” and noted their “fight against the imperialist hegemonistic policies of the US and its satellites against the Russian Federation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin expressed his hope that the next meeting between the pair would "take place in Moscow" in an apparent invitation to the North Korean leader to visit the Russian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian president and Kim later signed a partnership that included a vow of mutual aid if either country is attacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear what kind of assistance the deal, described as a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” would call for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin’s first visit to North Korea in 24 years comes amid growing concerns over an arms arrangement in which the country provides Moscow with essential munitions for the war in Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile programme.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the number of business outlets remained stable in recent years, despite claims Hong Kong was going through a wave of shop closures due to a sluggish economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Commerce minister Algernon Yau made the comment when responding to a written question from lawmaker Andrew Lam, who noted that netizens had opened a social media group on the closures, with more than 300,000 users joining the group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted there were more than 95,000 outlets in the catering, retail, beauty and hairdressing sectors at the end of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of establishments of these industries had once recorded a drop owing to the impact of the epidemic in the last few years, but it has rebounded since the end of 2021 to remain stable with the epidemic subsiding in recent years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials do not keep records of shop openings and closures and that these were business decisions based on a number of factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said as small to medium enterprises faced challenges, due to more Hongkongers travelling north of the border to consume, the administration had been providing help through a number of measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include low-interest concessionary loans of nearly HK$19 billion to ensure these companies could maintain steady cash flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials would continue to closely monitor the situation, and help firms "ride out the storm".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ex-husband of a fashion influencer found dead in 2023 was on Wednesday sentenced to 42 months in prison for stealing gold and jewellery worth more than HK$6 million and jumping bail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alex Kwong, ex-husband of Abby Choi, pleaded guilty in the District Court to stealing necklaces, bracelets, pendants, bullion and gold pellets between June 2013 and January 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court heard that Kwong falsely claimed to be engaged in a mainland gold investment business and stole items from six people he persuaded to buy jewellery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While on bail following his arrest in 2015, he failed to report to police as instructed and didn't turn up for a court hearing that year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was arrested in February 2023 at a pier in the New Territories while allegedly trying to flee the city by speedboat following Choi's death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong admitted failing to surrender to custody.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence, Judge David Cheung said Kwong's series of crimes over a period of 1.5 years  was not due to momentary greed, but deliberate action to steal from others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung noted that the defendant had since compensated the victims for their losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong, along with his father and brother are charged with murdering Choi, while Kwong's mother faces a charge of perverting the course of justice in relation to the case.

 The Hang Seng Index climbed 140 points, or 0.79 percent, to open at 18,056 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rise in the local bourse tracked gains across the region as Asian shares rose to their highest level in three weeks at the start of trading on Wednesday, boosted by a rally in tech stocks while the dollar wobbled after soft US retail sales data reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Regan Smith set the 100 metres backstroke world record at the US Olympic trials in Indianapolis on Tuesday, touching the wall first in 57.13 to shave 0.2 seconds off Australian Kaylee McKeown's previous mark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just over a month to go before the Games, Smith's win in the final sealed her place on the US team and sets up a Paris showdown with McKeown, who swam 57.33 in Hungary last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of myself," Smith said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Backstroke is hard for me sometimes but to fight back like this and get that back means a lot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff was second with a time of 57.91.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith, a three-time Olympic medallist who took bronze in the event at the Tokyo Games, still has two more events to contest at the trials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the second world mark to fall at Indianapolis after Gretchen Walsh smashed the record in the 100 metres butterfly on Saturday, an event in which Smith also swam and set a personal best time. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Edmonton Oilers held off a furious late rally to defeat the Florida Panthers 5-3 and keep their dreams of an improbable Stanley Cup Final comeback alive on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Oilers, down 3-0 after the first three games of the best-of-seven series, built on the momentum from their 8-1 thrashing of Florida on Saturday to claim a hard-fought road win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers now have the chance to level the series with a victory on their home ice in Edmonton in game six on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edmonton are bidding to become only the second team in ice hockey history to overturn a 3-0 series deficit to lift the Stanley Cup after Toronto achieved the feat in 1942.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor McDavid's second goal of the night in the dying seconds sealed a pulsating victory for the Oilers, who are hoping to end Canada's 31-year wait for a Stanley Cup champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Brown fired the short-handed Oilers into the lead after just 5min 30, snaffling possession near halfway during a Florida power play before coolly rounding Sergei Bobrovsky and tucking away the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers doubled their lead early in the second period with a power-play goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They held firm after McDavid's second goal of the night, an empty-netter, ensured a game six on Saturday morning at eight, Hong Kong time. (AFP)

    'Hong Kong to act as window to promote hydrogen use'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan says the development of hydrogen helps Hong Kong gain business opportunities. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758087_1_20240619111244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said it would be difficult for Hong Kong to pursue large-scale production and usage of hydrogen, but the city could act as the mainland's showcase to the international community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, the minister said limited space in Hong Kong made it difficult for the mass production of hydrogen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tse said the SAR could leverage its unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can act as a window, a base for demonstration, to promote hydrogen products overseas. The international community can also come to Hong Kong for financing when it needs to," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hydrogen development is not only for us and helping us to pursue carbon neutrality, but it is also an opportunity for business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government earlier announced its strategy on hydrogen development, aimed at addressing climate change and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with 14 trial projects in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the administration is now looking into which industries would be suitable and cost-effective to use hydrogen, which is relatively pricey, and will formulate standards and guidelines.
