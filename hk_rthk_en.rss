<div class="itemFullText">
 The infrastructure arm of Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison conglomerate announced on Wednesday that it would put in place a secondary share listing on the London Stock Exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure Holdings said it an announcement that it had sought permission from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and expected to begin trading in its shares on the London bourse’s main market on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The company believes that a listing in London, in addition to the Company’s listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will benefit its geographically diverse shareholder base and will assist in building the company’s profile and provide a greater market for trading in the shares,” CK said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has been appointed to manage the listing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company noted that Britain was its largest market, with 35.7 percent of profit attributable to shareholders coming from the UK last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company had earlier announced a 2 percent increase in earnings for the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure also announced that it was buying a portfolio of windfarms in the UK for HK$3.5 billion, its third acquisition of the year.

    Govt condemns Patten's remarks on top court ruling

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it opposes Chris Patten's malicious slandering against the top court's verdict and his wanton personal vilifications against Lord Neuberger. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766193_1_20240814215120.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it strongly condemned remarks made by the last governor of colonial Hong Kong regarding a recent Court of Final Appeal ruling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chris Patten, writing in the Guardian newspaper, described the top court's decision to uphold the convictions of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019, as "unjust".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the verdict was "made worse" because David Neuberger, a former president of Britain's supreme court, was a party to the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SAR administration said it opposed the former governor's "malicious slandering" against the verdict and his "wanton personal vilifications" against Lord Neuberger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patten's slandering remarks were made in blatant disregard of the detailed legal analysis by the [Court of Final Appeal] in its 76-page judgement and the factual background of the relevant case," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such remarks were made for the sole purpose of exerting political pressure on the judges ... in an attempt to influence the judicial system of the [Hong Kong SAR], and were nothing but a despicable political manoeuvre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said Patten's criticisms against Neuberger were "completely groundless and unjustified personal attacks" aimed at smearing his reputation and undermining the system of non-permanent judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone has the right to express his or her views on court decisions within the boundaries permitted by the law, but no one can abusively criticise or slander judges, or make baseless allegations purely out of political motives," the spokesperson added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethnic minority pupils in Hong Kong who embarked on a mainland study tour under a new visa-free scheme said they had acquired much knowledge about the country's culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of more than 20 students from Yaumati Kaifong Association School returned to the SAR after a three-day trip across Guangdong province, designed to foster a deeper understanding of the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They learnt about martial arts, paper-cutting and Chinese calligraphy, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really enjoyed Chinese calligraphy. It's fun, beautiful and creative," said nine-year-old Dangal Zane, who learnt to write the Chinese character for "family".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now I know more about Chinese culture and arts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her schoolmate Limbu Maeson, 12, said the trip inspired him to contemplate living across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, maybe I'll decide to work there, because there are a lot of businesses," he said. "I feel like the education is more intense in China, because of the exams. Besides that, maybe it will be a good shot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maeson, just like others on the exchange tour, crossed the border using a new travel permit for permanent residents with foreign passports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time when we went to China, it took way longer and we were stressed out about what if we didn't make it," he said, adding that it only took him a minute to pass through immigration this time round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Ka-ho, a school manager who led the tour, had nothing but praise for the new travel scheme for non-Chinese SAR residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, they did not even have the chance to sign up for an exchange tour due to the lack of a permit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But that's not the case anymore. They could sign up for these tours ... so that they have more opportunities to take part in the country's development and observe the progress by travelling to the mainland."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting from July, Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens can apply for a five-year permit to enter the mainland for short-term purposes such as business, tourism and exchanges.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vendors from around the world will showcase their delicacies at the Food Expo, which runs for five days starting on Friday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766176_1_20240814180537.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Food Expo returns tomorrow at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, as vendors remain hopeful about sales amid the changing spending habits of local consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, nearly half a million people thronged the five-day extravaganza, with the organiser, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, saying they spent an average of $1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the recent trend of Hongkongers spending their weekends in Shenzhen and other parts of Guangdong Province has threatened local businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's marketing associate director, Eddie Lee, pointed out they've done a lot to promote this year's event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing a lot of promotion to communicate the selling point, and the highlights of our expos to...not just our local audience, and by these promotional activities in nearby areas, the Greater Bay Area, we hope also to attract visitors from our nearby cities to visit Hong Kong and participate in our fairs," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the 34th edition of the popular event will be held in conjunction with three other expos, featuring vendors specialising in tea, beauty and wellness products and home appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Admission costs $30 per adult, or $10 if they enter before noon on weekdays or after 6pm every night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An extra $10 is charged for those who wish to enter the "gourmet zone" where visitors are offered a taste of delicacies from around the world, including French foie gras, Australian abalone and Japanese vinegar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tencent has posted a 72 percent year-on-year increase in interim net profit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  First-half earnings at the Chinese internet giant reached 89.5 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not offering an interim dividend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Net profit for the April-June period, meanwhile, jumped 82 percent from a year ago to 47.6 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter revenue climbed 8 percent to 161.1 billion yuan, driven by a recovery in its gaming business after a launch of a new mobile game in May that got off to a strong start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long-awaited "Dungeon & Fighter Mobile" title dominated top-grossing charts on Apple's iOS platform in China for nearly a month after its release, according to industry data. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Cyclothon will be revamped this year, with new routes and a sports-themed carnival being introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's largest cycling event will return on October 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 50-kilometre race will go through the Sha Tin Heights Tunnel, while the 32-kilometre event will cross Ting Kau Bridge for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both races will start in Tsim Sha Tsui and end at the Jordan Road Flyover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Chan, the board's general manager of event and product development, said a carnival will be held in the West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's actually very important for us to add more different elements to our Hong Kong Cyclothon," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for a lot of cyclists, after they finish their 50-kilometre or 32-kilometre [race], it will be actually good for them to have some relaxing experiences, either a dance class, yoga class or stretching class. It's a good hangout place for them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Registration for the cyclothon opens at 10am on August 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The board said it will accept more than 6,000 registrations in total this year – 800 more than last year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday as it ruled against him in an ethics case. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766160_1_20240814165201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who served jail time, raising the spectre of more political upheaval and a reset of the governing alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I respect the verdict. I reiterate that for the almost one year I have been in this role, I have tried with good intentions to lead the country with honesty," Srettha told reporters outside his office after the court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real estate tycoon Srettha becomes the fourth Thai premier in 16 years to be removed by verdicts by the same court, after it ruled he violated the constitution by appointing a minister who did not meet ethical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's removal after less than a year in power means parliament must convene to choose a new premier, with the prospect of more uncertainty in a country dogged for two decades by coups and court rulings that have brought down multiple governments and political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same court last week dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party, the hugely popular opposition, ruling its campaign to reform a law against insulting the crown risked undermining the constitutional monarchy. It regrouped on Friday under a new party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors have borne the brunt of Thailand's turmoil, with two of its governments removed by coups in a long-running grudge match between the party's founders, the billionaire Shinawatra family, and their rivals in the conservative establishment and royalist military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision could rock a fragile truce between political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra and his enemies among the conservative elite and military old guard, which enabled the tycoon's return from 15 years of self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board. The bribery allegation was never proven and Pichit resigned in May.
  <br/>

  Deputy premier Phumtham Wechayachai is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple supplier Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent rise in second-quarter net profit, driven by strong AI server demand as the company touted "strong growth momentum" from the technology boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's largest contract electronics maker, said net profit for the April-June quarter rose to US$1.09 billion from US$1.02 billion in the same period the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That beat analysts' average estimate of US$1.06 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the firm's fourth consecutive quarterly profit rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said AI servers accounted for more than 40 percent of its server business in the second quarter, saying its next generation AI computing solution had brought "strong growth momentum."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foxconn had previously expected revenue for the second quarter to grow significantly from a year earlier, although revenue from smart computer electronics including smartphones was likely to be flattish.

  The company expected its operations to pick up gradually in the second half as many electronics vendors, including Apple, usually release new products ahead of the year-end holiday season.
  <br/>

  In a report prior to the earnings announcement, Taipei-based KGI Securities revised up its sales forecast for Foxconn this year, saying strong demand for new iPhones and AI servers were likely to lead to a better-than-expected outlook for the firm in the second half. (Reuters)

    Tam Tak-chi to appeal sedition conviction in top court

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top court on Wednesday granted jailed former activist Tam Tak-chi a final attempt to appeal against his conviction and sentence for sedition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three presiding judges at the Court of Final Appeal agreed to look into whether offences under now-repealed sedition laws must be tried at the Court of First Instance before a judge and a jury, and if the prosecution has to prove a defendant intended to incite others to commit violence or public disorder in order to secure a conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appeal is set to be heard by Hong Kong's top court on January 10 next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam, a former vice chairman of People Power, had lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his conviction and 40-month prison sentence for his chanting of slogans in the street in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judges at the lower court ruled that the intention to incite violence was not a necessary element for the offence, and that there's nothing suggesting people were subject to "an unacceptably harsh burden" due to the restriction imposed by it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sedition offences stipulated by sections 9 and 10 of the Crimes Ordinance have since been repealed and replaced by provisions in Hong Kong's domestic national security law.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

    Govt probing alleged resale of public hospital drugs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Medicine from a public hospital was allegedly sold via HKTVMall. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766126_1_20240814124922.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched into suspicions that medicine from a public hospital ended up for sale on an e-commerce platform, authorities said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, HKTVMall said it had removed a merchant from its online marketplace after a buyer complained that packaging for an order came with a label indicating the product had originally been given to a patient of Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The product is a laxative which is not classed as a poison and does not require a prescription or for sales to be supervised by a pharmacist, the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, the administration expressed "grave concern over the suspected resale of public hospital patients' medicines" and said the matter will be dealt with seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The DH (Department of Health) is liaising with the Hospital Authority to seriously investigate into the alleged case and shall take prompt enforcement action as appropriate," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this specific case, the DH will investigate along the line of illegal sale of unregistered pharmaceutical products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, So Yiu-wah, president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, suggested that "over-prescribing" of medicines by public hospitals could have played a role in the alleged incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patient rights advocate Tim Pang, from the Society for Community Organisation, said doctors at public hospitals tend to dish out too much medication because of the length of time patients have to wait for their next consultation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang said more community pharmacies would solve this problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because if there are enough community pharmacies for patients to refill the drugs, then the public hospital doctors can prevent from prescribing a lot of drugs to the patients during that waiting period," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten thousand flats will be built near the future Pak Shek Kok MTR Station next to Tolo Harbour and the Science Park, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new East Rail Line station, between Tai Po Market and University, is expected to be completed by 2033.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the Development Bureau said the MTR Corporation is carrying out extensive technical assessments for the station's construction and land development strategies, with a detailed plan for the project to be announced later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Scott Leung said the MTR station and related transport infrastructure should be built before the residential units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's also a member of the Housing Authority, said this approach would ensure efficient and convenient transport for the residents.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources told RTHK the government was working to have two giant pandas arrive in the SAR by late September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two adult pandas, aged between five and eight, are a gift from mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government confirmed that Secretary for Culture, Sports, and Tourism Kevin Yeung would attend a signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement in Sichuan regarding the arrival of the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will head to the province on Thursday morning with representatives from Ocean Park, and will oversee the logistics of transporting the animals to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said Yeung would also be responsible for naming the pandas, adding that September 26 is one of the potential arrival dates for the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Yeung's return to Hong Kong on Friday, Raistlin Lau will serve as acting culture, sports, and tourism chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee had earlier paid a visit to Sichuan, and said the male panda chosen by mainland authorities is agile and smart, while the female panda is gentle and cute.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday said he would not seek re-election as head of his party, meaning the end of his premiership after just under three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since 1945, is due to hold an internal leadership contest next month. Its popularity ratings have slumped because of rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this presidential election, it is necessary to show the people that the LDP is changing and the party is a new LDP," Kishida told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this, transparent and open elections and free and vigorous debate are important. The most obvious first step to show that the LDP will change is for me to step aside," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will not be running in the forthcoming presidential election."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida had informed senior administration officials of his intention not to run, media including national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo news reported earlier,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the ruling party is traditionally also prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida, 67, has been in office since October 2021, and has seen his and his party's poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices hitting Japanese incomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His cabinet's support rating has been languishing around 25 percent this year, according to an NHK poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's fourth-largest economy has also struggled to gain traction, with output shrinking 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen (more than US$100 billion at the time) as he tried to ease the pressure from inflation and rescue his premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having seen prices barely move for years, Japanese voters have been reeling from rising prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, pushing up energy costs and putting pressure on the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some recovery in recent weeks, the yen has been one of the world's worst-performing currencies over the past year, falling sharply against the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While welcome news to Japanese exporters, this makes imports pricier and stokes inflation for households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before November, the government had injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy over the past three years since the pandemic. (AFP)

 Defending champion Demi Vollering won Tuesday's 6.3km time trial through the streets of Rotterdam to take over the lead after three stages of the women's Tour de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fellow Dutchwoman Charlotte Kool made it two wins from two stages on home soil in the morning, before Vollering clocked the fastest time in the second part of a Tuesday double-header to grab the yellow jersey.

  Vollering powered around the course in 7min 25sec to finish ahead of Olympic time-trial bronze medallist Chloe Dygert.

  "I am very surprised that I managed to win this time trial. Even with a difference of five seconds. I have no idea how that's possible," said Vollering.

    Mbappé 'ready' for Real Madrid debut: Ancelotti

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé appears ready to make his debut for Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup against Atalanta on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the France striker arrived in good shape following the European Championship and was adapting well to the team after a week of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé “could play tomorrow,” Ancelotti said Tuesday at a news conference at the National Stadium in Warsaw where the match will be played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé is the biggest draw in the Polish capital after finally joining Madrid following a drawn-out saga with his former club, Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was introduced to the club’s fans at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium last month,  but wasn’t part of the squad on its U.S. tour while he rested after Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He joins a slew of world-class forwards at Madrid, including Vinícius Júnior, another new signing in Brazil striker Endrick, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Arda Guler. (AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn hamstring and will miss the Test series against Sri Lanka, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "England Men's Test Captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the summer after tearing his left hamstring while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred on Sunday," said an ECB statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old all-rounder will be replaced as Test skipper by vice-captain Ollie Pope, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of the scans conducted in Leeds on Tuesday, Stokes will miss England's three-match Test series against Sri Lanka," said the ECB. "The all-rounder is aiming to return for England's winter Test tour of Pakistan, scheduled to start in early October."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first Test against Sri Lanka begins next Wednesday at Old Trafford. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Tuesday as traders responded positively to cooler-than-expected producer inflation data, bolstering expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.1 percent in July, down slightly from a month earlier, the Labour Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data will likely be well-received by the Federal Reserve as it weighs the right time to begin cutting interest rates from their current 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices on Wall Street finished higher on Wednesday, led by the Nasdaq, which closed up 2.4 percent at 17,187.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished 1.0 percent higher at 39,765, and the S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent to 5,434.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trend in inflation is leading in the right direction, and today was good news," said Tom Cahill, from Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That suggests that the Fed will very likely cut the rates" in September, he added,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual firms, coffee giant Starbucks closed 24.5 percent higher after it named Chipotle chief executive Brian Niccol as its new CEO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the good news for Starbucks was bad news for Chipotle, whose shares closed down 7.5 percent following the news of Niccol's departure. (AFP)

    Banksy lifts curtain on London animal mural series

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The mural outside London Zoo is thought to be the last in the current series. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766068_1_20240814032242.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elusive street artist Banksy's ninth animal-themed mural in nine days, unveiled on Tuesday on a shutter outside London Zoo, depicted a gorilla releasing animals from the zoo, tying together the series of artworks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Claimed by the artist on Instagram, the mural outside London Zoo showed a gorilla lifting the shutter to free birds and a seal, with some animals staring out from the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the latest in Banksy's series populating the British capital with animals, starting with a goat revealed last week on Monday, followed by two elephants the next day and then monkeys, a wolf, pelicans, a cat, piranhas and a rhinoceros in subsequent days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frequency of artworks is unusual for Banksy – whose identity is publicly unknown – and who usually spaces out his pieces over months, leaving fans speculating about the meaning of the different animals and awaiting a "big" reveal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mural was "an absolute shock and surprise to all of us here at London Zoo," Karl Penman, commercial operations manager at the zoo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it is the full stop, what a great full stop to end on," Penman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported the that piece was the last in the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can see the watchful eyes, which to me look a little bit uncertain about whether they want to be free," said doctor Sharmela Darne about the eyes of animals staring from behind the shutter in the latest artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the seal's clearly going away and so are the birds flying free... so maybe it's about freedom and being unsure about freedom," said Darne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For many, the animal safari has added some positivity to their week, as the country reeled following the death of three girls in a stabbing and ensuing violent riots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of two pelicans painted over a fish shop in Walthamstow, northeast London, Peter McCarthy said it had been "very nice to have it in this particular week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Very nice that he's been around the country when there's been such trouble. Doing these wonderful things."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For others, the choice of animals has meaning, with some finding the goat similar to a Palestinian mountain gazelle and others pointing out the artist's previous work on the climate crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the artworks have already been removed or stolen, and the rhino revealed on Monday was defaced the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A satellite dish painted with the wolf was stolen within hours of being claimed by Banksy, with the cat on a billboard removed by contractors and a police box painted with swimming piranhas removed by the local authority to ensure it was "properly protected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of the cat on Saturday before it was removed, dentist Mitul Patel said he wished "people would leave his work alone so that other people could enjoy it as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locals and tourists alike have been enjoying the artworks that are still up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking a brief pause from his job, construction worker Owen said the three monkeys in east London's Shoreditch area were "very exciting" and a "big talking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Mazur, a photographer visiting from the US, said he had been "running around photographing all" the artworks, and was "bummed" about having to return to New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retiree Don Gould lives around the corner from the goat in southwest London's Kew Green, and saw the artwork after it was revealed online last week. "It's a very good excuse for a stroll on the green and a pint, isn't it?" (AFP)

    US car workers union files charges against Trump, Musk

    <![CDATA[<img alt="During their live-streamed conversation on X, Donald Trump heaped praise on Elon Musk for his history of firing employees at the drop of a hat. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766067_1_20240814025737.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A major US car workers union filed federal labour charges on Tuesday against Donald Trump and Elon Musk, accusing the billionaires of illegally intimidating workers during a rambling and highly publicised conversation on X.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential hopeful and Musk, who has endorsed him, exchanged a checklist of radical conspiracy theories as they chatted on the social network on Monday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one point the conversation veered into Musk's time at the helm of his multiple companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I mean, I look at what you do," Trump said to Musk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You walk in, you say, 'You want to quit?' They go on strike," Trump said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That's OK, you're all gone. You're all gone. So, every one of you is gone.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk carried out massive layoffs after his acquisition of Twitter (now X) was finalised in October 2022, and he announced in April the dismissal of more than 10 percent of Tesla's global workforce, amounting to at least 14,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labour Relations Act," said the United Auto Workers (UAW), which has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris after previously backing Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean. When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean," said UAW President Shawn Fain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Trump and Musk want working class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly," Fain said. "It's disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk owns the social network X, SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, among other companies. He has been criticised in the past for obstructing the unionisation of his employees around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla has been at odds with unions in Sweden and Norway for a few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several complaints have also been filed in California by former SpaceX workers who say employees who tried to protest job conditions were retaliated against. (AFP)

    Israeli far-right minister prays at disputed mosque

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from several Muslim countries, as well as the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766064_1_20240814022139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A far-right Israeli minister prayed with thousands of Jews at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem on Tuesday, defying a ban on Jewish prayer at the flashpoint site and drawing global condemnation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to "defeat Hamas" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The compound is Islam's third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity, but it is also Judaism's holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israel-Hamas war, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for threatened attacks from Iran and its proxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not only is it unacceptable, it detracts from what we think is a vital time, as we are working to get this ceasefire deal across the finish line," US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years, the restrictions have been increasingly flouted by hardline religious nationalists like Ben Gvir, prompting sometimes violent reactions from Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, he and some 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns, under the protection of Israeli police, said an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is custodian of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli police also "imposed restrictions" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said, adding that more than 700 Jews also prayed there in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque, is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa Mosque," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the "storming" of the mosque, calling it a "flagrant violation of international law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continual violations of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities require a clear and firm international position that condemns these violations," ministry spokesperson Sufyan al-Qudah said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group of Muslim-majority states, "strongly condemned" the incident and said it was a "provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was "against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This sort of behaviour is unhelpful and it is unduly provocative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on X that the bloc "strongly condemns the provocations" by Ben Gvir.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted on social media networks showed Ben Gvir inside the compound while several Israelis lay on the ground performing Talmudic rituals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir released a video statement on X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, renewing his opposition to any truce in the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo," he said, referring to the US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza set to resume on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can defeat Hamas... we must bring them down to their knees," Ben Gvir said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's entry into the Al-Aqsa compound comes on the Jewish mourning day of Tisha Be'Av that commemorates the destruction of the ancient temple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month too, Ben Gvir, who is known for provocative gestures, said he had prayed inside the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man appeared in a London court on Tuesday charged with attempted murder after an 11-year-old girl was stabbed in one of the capital's busiest tourist areas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ioan Pintaru, 32, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court, which heard that he was a Romanian citizen with no fixed address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The girl was with her mother when she was attacked in Leicester Square on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said Pintaru had "approached the girl, placed her into a headlock, he's then stabbed her eight times to the body."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was taken to hospital with serious but not life threatening injuries. She was wounded in the face, shoulder, wrist and neck area, the prosecutor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said they do not believe that the suspect knew the girl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pintaru was remanded in custody to appear in court again on September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack outside top brand stores in the central London square came two weeks after a mass stabbing in Southport, northwest England, in which three girls were killed and eight children and two adults wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack sparked riots across England, after rumours spread online that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England batsman Graham Thorpe died after being struck by a train at a railway station, an inquest into his death heard on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 55-year-old took his own life, his wife Amanda revealed on Monday in an interview with The Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe died on the morning of August 4 having suffered "traumatic injuries" during the incident at Esher railway station, southwest of London, Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area coroner for Surrey, Simon Wickens, recorded Thorpe's cause of death as one of multiple injuries during the short hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner offered his "sincere condolences" not just to Thorpe's family, but to "all those touched by his life and career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A date for the full inquest will be fixed at a later time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's death plunged the cricket world into mourning for the popular star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoyed an impressive England career as an elegant batsman from 1993 to 2005, before spending 12 years in various coaching roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Thorpe was hospitalised in May 2022 and declared "seriously ill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe told The Times that the former Surrey batsman attempted suicide two years ago before taking his own life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite having a wife and two daughters whom he loved and who loved him, he did not get better. He was so unwell in recent times and he really did believe that we would be better off without him and we are devastated that he acted on that and took his own life," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe added: "Graham was renowned as someone who was very mentally strong on the field and he was in good physical health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But mental illness is a real disease and can affect anyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's daughter Kitty, 22, said the family "are not ashamed" of talking about his death, adding: "There is nothing to hide and it is not a stigma."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-hander featured in 100 Test matches and 82 one-day internationals for England, scoring over 9,000 runs for his country, including 16 Test hundreds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in India on Tuesday said hospital services were disrupted in several Indian cities after a doctors' protest spread nationwide following the rape and murder of a trainee medic in the city of Kolkata.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of doctors marched on Monday in Kolkata and the surrounding West Bengal state to denounce the killing at a government-run hospital, demanding justice for the victim and better security measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old doctor was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests spread on Tuesday, with more than 8,000 government doctors in the western Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, halting work in all hospital departments except emergency services, media said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the capital, New Delhi, junior doctors wearing white coats held posters that read, "Doctors are not punching bags," as they sat in protest outside a large government hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar protests in cities such as Lucknow, capital of the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, and in the western tourist resort state of Goa hit some hospital services, media said. (Reuters)

    Africa health body warns over mpox spread

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The African Union's health watchdog on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over the growing mpox outbreak on the continent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766050_1_20240813221254.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Africa's top public health body declared what it termed a "public health emergency of continental security" on Tuesday over an outbreak of mpox that spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I declare with a heavy heart but with an unyielding commitment to our people, to our African citizens, we declare mpox as public health emergency of continental security," Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said during an online media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox is transmitted through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. Most cases are mild but it can kill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as Clade I.
  <br/>
  But the new variant, known as Clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, particularly among children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Africa CDC warned last week the viral infection's rate of spread was alarming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that more than 15,000 mpox cases and 461 deaths were reported on the continent this year so far, representing a 160 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades after it was first detected in human in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A milder version of the virus spread to over 100 countries in 2022, largely through sexual contact, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO ended the emergency 10 months later, saying the health crisis had come under control. (Reuters)

    New data indicates easing US inflation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures are further cooling. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766045_1_20240813212653.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures were cooling further as the Federal Reserve moves closer to cutting interest rates, likely beginning next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that its producer price index — which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers — rose 0.1 percent from June to July and 2.2 percent from a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices were unchanged from June and up 2.4 percent from July 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases were milder than forecasters had expected and were nearly consistent with the Fed's two percent inflation target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index can provide an early sign of where consumer inflation is headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Labor Department will release the most well-known inflation measure, the consumer price index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters have estimated that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent from June to July, after actually falling 0.1 percent the previous month, and three percent from July 2023, according to a survey by the data firm FactSet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation has plummeted since peaking at a four-decade high in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as Americans prepare to vote in the November presidential election, many remain unhappy with consumer prices, which are nearly 19 percent higher than were before the inflationary surge began in the spring of 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have assigned blame to US President Joe Biden, though it's unclear whether they will hold Vice President Kamala Harris responsible as she seeks the presidency. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Insurers may not pay out if trips to Japan are cancelled or cut short in the event that a feared "megaquake" in the country actually materialises, an industry representative said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On August 8, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern island of Kyushu, prompting Japanese authorities to issue their first-ever warning of an increased risk of a major quake in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers has urged travellers to carefully study the fine print of their policies, adding that they may not cover disruption linked to a "known risk" such as any further quake connected to the one of last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [insurance] scheme was purchased after the initial earthquake on August 8, then people may not receive compensation if their trip was cancelled or cut short," said the federation's chief executive, Selina Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Hong Kong airport, a man surnamed Lo and his family were checking in for their flight to Tokyo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said they decided to go ahead with the 10-day trip after confirming their travel insurance was still valid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We planned the trip for a very long time. I don't want to disappoint my kids and family. It is a bit risky, but we still want to go," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Yip said she had "no choice" but to go ahead with her trip to Osaka as she did not want to lose the money she paid for the flights and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I booked the trip around five months ago and I could not apply for a refund now," she said, adding that her insurer had reassured her that the trip would still be covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have checked the consulate's phone numbers and if anything happens, I will deal with it when it comes," she said.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Myanmar and Thailand from August 14 to 17.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wang's trip to Myanmar is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in various fields and fostering closer bonds between the two peoples.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also said China supports Myanmar's effort to maintain stability and develop its economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior Myanmar official said Wang would hold talks with the country's military chief during the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang Yi will meet with Min Aung Hlaing, the senior official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After his visit to Myanmar, Wang will head to Thailand to co-chair the ninth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The LMC is a regional cooperation mechanism among China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the sidelines of the LMC meeting, Wang will have informal discussions with his counterparts in Thailand, Myanmar and Laos on the regional situation. (Additional reporting by Xinhua and AFP)

    'High interest rates weigh on SMEs confidence'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Senior Standard Chartered economist Kelvin Lau (right) says lingering global uncertainties have affected SME business confidence. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766023_1_20240813172255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Productivity Council on Tuesday warned that a high interest rate environment is putting pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with business confidence among SMEs dropping to the lowest point in two years
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a quarterly survey conducted by the council in July, 56 percent of the 814 local businesses interviewed said high interest rates had affected consumer spending, with the most affected industries being retail, accommodation and food services and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, about one-third of the SMEs interviewed said they had a cash flow or supply chain problem because of the high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said business sentiment among SMEs remained cautious, with the latest Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index recording a decline in confidence to 42.5 points, dropping from 47.3 in the previous quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief innovation officer Lawrence Cheung said 10 of the 11 industries involved in the survey had shown a drop in confidence, with real estate having the lowest score. He said that indicated both external and domestic-oriented sectors were under-performing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Standard Chartered senior economist Kelvin Lau said the survey indicated a lack of confidence among SMEs over the global economic outlook due to external uncertainties lingering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Number one is the possibility of [Donald] Trump coming into office after the US elections in November. And the other being China's recent macro data weakness following its slightly weaker than expected Q2 GDP [growth], which came in at 4.7 percent rather than anything closer to 5 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So overall, it's kind of like a double whammy that the local businesses need to worry about the US and they need to worry about China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he added there are certain bright spots, citing expectations the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates from September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our own view is that we could see a collective 75 basis points of cuts between now and the year-end and possibly even more cuts in the first half of next year, to as much as 125 basis points in total,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So that would hopefully be a lot of relief to the Hong Kong SMEs, in particular the real estate sector, for example, and to some extent the accommodation and food services sector as well.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on low-incomes in Hong Kong are struggling to afford nutritious food and some are having to skip meals altogether due to rising prices, an NGO said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Food Grace said it carried out a survey involving more than 500 underprivileged people in Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po, finding that a third had cut back on the number of meals they ate due to financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of the respondents said that to save money, they either opted for less healthy food or went hungry on occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO described the situation as worrying and urged the government to provide food subsidies to those in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Angela Lo, project manager with the group, said better education on healthy eating would benefit many people who need to cook on a limited budget.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Tuesday said underprivileged students who are taking part in a government mentorship scheme in Hangzhou have been able to learn a lot about Chinese culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister is leading a delegation taking some 80 teenagers to the mainland city, as part of the Strive and Rise Programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a museum visit, Chan told reporters the teenagers he spoke to have become more confident and pro-active.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last year we began by organising five tours, and the reaction was quite good. Students who joined were all very happy. This year we've increased to 18 tours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, we want to encourage more enterprises and partners to offer us more sponsorships, so we can organise more of these activities that allow children to go on trips and learn more about the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added it's important for the students to gain knowledge from their mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who retired right after her victory at the Paris Games to join the Jockey Club, is also part of the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Strive and Rise Programme was introduced in Chief Executive John Lee's maiden policy address in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospital bosses have expressed concerns and vowed to take follow-up action after a woman was allegedly sold a medication prescribed by a public hospital from a purchase via HKTVmall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The online shopping site said it had removed the product from its shelves and was investigating the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a photo circulating online, the woman, who was reportedly 38 weeks pregnant at the time of the incident, complained she had placed an order for lactulose, but received the laxative with another patient's name and information indicating it was from Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident came to light on Monday following a post on the online discussion forum LIHKG, with the woman who claimed to be the buyer expressing concern about the quality of the medication and whether it would affect her baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, HKTVmall said the customer reported an issue with the product on July 9 last year, upon receiving the order on May 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the vendor was unable to provide information about the order, given that it had been delivered to her in May 2023, with relevant security camera footage and photos deleted, while the report was filed more than a month after delivery
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site said it had removed the seller from its platform and the vendor must provide valid information of its proof of delivery, HKTVmall added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If violations are found, the vendor will be penalised. In serious cases, we will terminate the contract, and the vendor concerned will have to bear the relevant legal responsibilities," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority, for its part, said it was very concerned about the incident and reminded people not resell or pass the drugs for others' use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials would follow up seriously and refer to law enforcement agencies if any illegal activities were found, the authority added.

    Olympics boost sales at Kwun Tong mall

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds flocking to malls to watch the Paris Olympics boosted footfall, an operator said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties' leasing department said its mall in Kwun Tong saw 20 percent more people compared to the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said this was because social distancing measures were still in place during the Tokyo Games, adding that there was a joyous atmosphere this time due to the success of the SAR and national teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said sales went up significantly at restaurants, as well as stores selling trainers which saw a 20 percent increase in business. She said watching the events inspired people to take up exercise or sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another reason [for increased sales] was that there were breaks between matches, the short ones lasted five to 10 minutes, while long ones could span over half an hour, or one hour. During this period of time, as residents wanted to continue watching the Games, they would wander around and return to the atrium to watch the match after enjoying their meals," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business at eateries rose 15 percent during the Paris Olympics, with people heading to shopping malls to watch the Games, and shops opening much longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said food delivery services also enjoyed a 10 percent growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although there are a lot of people going to spend their time and entertain themselves in the Greater Bay Area, especially in Shenzhen, during the Olympics, I saw that more people stayed in Hong Kong, especially during night-time," Wong told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[For] some people, even though they went to Shenzhen during the day, they rushed back to Hong Kong, just wanting to view the competitions."

    Hong Kong dessert chain rides the French wave

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A nostalgic Hong Kong mango sago chain is thriving in one of the most unexpected places – Paris, showing that sweet treats can transcend boundaries, cultures and languages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui Lau Shan – a household name for classic Chinese desserts and herbal tea, and famous for its icy mango beverages and desserts – had been a fixture on the streets of Hong Kong since the 1960s, until the last franchised store in the SAR closed in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it is flourishing in the French capital because of a die-hard fan. Xu Xiaofeng brought the franchise to Paris after he developed a love affair with its fruity drinks when he was extremely thirsty one day during a Hong Kong work trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But becoming the owner of the Parisian Hui Lau Shan business was not easy. Xu said it took him three tries to convince the owners to grant him permission to expand the brand in France, where Xu had been an exchange student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the conditions was that he needed to stay true to Hui Lau Shan’s original taste, with the owners sending inspectors to ensure that the taste of the Paris branch matched that of the original back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Europe, people really love eating mangos,” a beaming Xu, wearing an apron and a red baseball cap emblazoned with the brand's logo told RTHK, as he prepared a signature drink by cutting up the fruit and putting it into a food blender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Basically, if there are more than ten tonnes of mangoes a year, Paris would consume more than half of them, so I know there is a good market here,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, they love mangoes very much, and second, many strive for healthy foods, so it was the perfect combination.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said his dessert shops first attracted Chinese customers living in France, but over time, he also won over the French, who he said did have one complaint – that his desserts were not sweet enough compared to local pastries and tarts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To address this, Xu decided to start blending elements from both cultures to bring the two culinary worlds together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think this is an exchange between desserts. For example, our pancakes use French cheese, cream and French Chantilly. This is a good blend. Now, French people are slowly starting to use a lot of fresh fruits to make their own desserts, which I think is a good exchange,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are able to learn from each other. Our desserts aren’t too sweet, but theirs are. With exchange, we can meet in the middle and create something new together.”

 Dutch rider Charlotte Kool kept her head amid a chaotic bunched sprint finish to win the first stage of the women's Tour de France on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It was really hectic but I like it. I kept on thinking 'I like hectic, I like chaos'," said the 25-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I went so early and I thought it's too long and it hurt so bad but it was enough in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kool, born in North Holland, took the yellow jersey on home soil as the women's Tour got underway in the Netherlands with a 123-kilometre flat ride from Rotterdam to The Hague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Topping 60kmh as she crossed the line, the Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL rider claimed her maiden Tour win with an unstoppable surge in the last 100 metres to complete the stage in a time of two hours 47 minutes and 40 seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The armed wing of Palestinian group Hamas said on Monday its militants had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, in two separate incidents in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages during their October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, with 111 of them still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement: "In two separate incidents, two recruits assigned to guard enemy prisoners fired at a Zionist prisoner, killing him immediately, and also injured two female prisoners critically."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement, posted on Telegram, did not identify the hostages or say when or where the incidents occurred, but noted "attempts are being made to save the lives" of the two women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida said Hamas had formed a committee to investigate the shootings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it does "not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas' claims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a televised briefing earlier on Monday, said: "We do not forget for a moment the hostages being cruelly held by Hamas in Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are deeply concerned about their physical and mental condition, given the prolonged time that has passed and the harsh conditions of their captivity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip since then has killed at least 39,897 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Investors are eyeing a report on the consumer price index – a key inflation gauge – due out on Wednesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Results on Wall Street were mixed on Monday, with markets in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the release of US inflation data this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.4 percent to 39,357, while the S&P 500 was flat at 5,344.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq gained 0.2 percent to 16,780.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is another one of these watch-and-wait days," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The volume is not very high," he added, while noting the week ahead would be "busy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In particular, investors are eyeing a report on the consumer price index – a key inflation gauge – due out on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This "should have some effect on how we view the battle against inflation," Sosnick added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start lowering interest rates at its meeting in September, although a weaker than expected labour market report at the start of this month fanned fears surrounding the US economy's health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are monitoring to see if inflation is cooling at a gradual pace – signalling the world's biggest economy is indeed achieving a "soft landing" where price increases ease without a downturn.
  <br/>

  Among individual companies, AI chip manufacturer Nvidia's shares advanced 4.1 percent. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukrainian troops who have crossed the border into its territory will be "dislodged." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765928_1_20240813023744.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his army on Monday to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops who have entered Russian territory as authorities said over 120,000 people had been evacuated away from the fighting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrsky told President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video posted on Monday that his troops now control about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory and are continuing "offensive operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told a televised meeting with government officials that "one of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord" and "destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky told the nation in his evening address that the cross-border offensive was "purely a security issue," capturing "areas from which the Russia army struck at our Sumy region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 121,000 people have fled the Kursk region since the start of the fighting, which has killed at least 12 civilians and injured 121 more, regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the meeting with Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Kursk announced on Monday they were widening their evacuation area to include a district with some 14,000 residents. The neighbouring Belgorod region also said it was evacuating a new border district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has pierced into the region by at least 12 kilometres and has captured 28 towns and villages, with the new front 40 kilometres long, Smirnov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Syrsky said that "as of now, about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory are under control," suggesting the area captured is more than twice as large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that fighting was ongoing along almost the whole front and "the situation is under our control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said Russia would respond by showing "unanimous support for all those in distress" and claimed there had been an increase in men signing up to fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enemy will receive a worthy riposte," he said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Monday held his first cabinet meeting in the country's future capital, despite much of the city remaining under construction as it runs behind schedule.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US$32-billion megaproject Nusantara was widely expected to be inaugurated on August 17, Indonesia's Independence Day, but building delays and funding woes have cast doubt on the schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, still hailed the city-in-progress, which is expected to be fully ready in 2045.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not all countries have the opportunity, have the ability to build their capital starting from zero," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Jokowi, the city is "being built with the concept of a forest city, a jungle city, a city full of green" in eastern Borneo island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But environmentalists have warned the rapid development of the new capital will hasten deforestation in one of the world's largest stretches of tropical rainforest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi – who started to work from the future capital several weeks ago – brought dozens of officials to Nusantara for the cabinet meeting, including his successor Prabowo Subianto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo pledged to continue the capital-to-be once he takes office in October, removing any doubt over his willingness to carry out Jokowi's legacy project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi resurrected the long-shelved plan to relocate the capital soon after taking office in 2019 after experts warned Jakarta – the megacity of 12 million people – was sinking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An official decree on moving the capital from Jakarta could be delayed until after Prabowo takes office, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said many times that I am determined to continue, if possible, to complete the project," said Prabowo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe in three, four, five years, the capital city can function."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ground broke on several projects on Monday, including the vice presidential palace and several private buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nusantara has struggled to attract crucial foreign investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jakarta will fund 20 percent of Nusantara and hopes to secure 100 trillion rupiah (US$6.13 billion) in private investment by the end of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as of Monday, Jokowi said it had received only 56.2 trillion rupiah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government aims to have 1.9 million people living in Nusantara by 2045. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Atletico Madrid signed striker Julian Alvarez from Manchester City on Monday in a deal reported to be worth up to 85 million euros (US$93 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The club has reached an agreement with Manchester City for the transfer of the Argentine forward, who has signed a contract for the next six seasons," said Atletico in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish reports say Atletico will pay 75 million euros for the forward, with potentially 10 million more in bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old arrived at City for just £14 million (16 million euros) in January 2022 from River Plate, winning two Premier League trophies and the Champions League among other silverware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez also helped Argentina lift the World Cup trophy in December 2022 and the Copa America in 2021 and 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I say goodbye to this amazing club, with a lot of emotion," Alvarez told City's club website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These have been two very special years. During this time, I have grown and learnt a lot – both as a player and as a person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez scored 36 goals for City in 103 appearances across all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's incredibly loved by the team for his behaviour but like I said many times for many players, he wants to leave and have a new challenge," said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diego Simeone's Atletico have also signed Robin Le Normand and Alexander Sorloth as they reinforce heavily to compete with Real Madrid and Barcelona, following a disappointing fourth-place La Liga finish last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Atletico begin the new campaign with a visit to face Villarreal on August 19. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive wildfire blazed its way into Athens' northeastern suburbs on Monday as hundreds of firefighters battled to contain it, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes and sparking a Greek government appeal for international help.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In scenes never before seen in the Greek capital, residents wearing masks against the choking smoke were desperately dousing their homes with water hoses in the leafy suburbs of Nea Penteli and Vrilissia in an effort to render them less vulnerable to fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television footage showed several cars in both areas gutted by fire and the roofs of stately homes burning as water-bombing helicopters roared overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation is dramatic," Penteli mayor Natassa Kosmopoulou told news portal newsit.gr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A school and homes are on fire, and I can see the fire coming towards the town hall," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece on Monday formally called for EU assistance, a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU civil protection mechanism was activated upon request of the Greek authorities," EU spokesman Balazs Ujvari said in a statement, adding that Italy, France, the Czech Republic and Romania were sending units to help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Paris was sending 180 firefighters, 55 trucks and a helicopter to assist their hard-pressed Greek colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wildfire started on Sunday afternoon in the town of Varnavas, some 35 kilometres northeast of Athens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aided by strong winds, it grew to a 30-kilometre long frontline of fires, more than 25 metres high in places, according to state TV ERT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 700 firefighters with 190 fire engines and over 30 aircraft sought to contain it, but it scaled Mount Pentelicon, which looms over the Greek capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several large Athens municipalities ordered partial evacuations, including Penteli, Vrilissia and Halandri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of the direction of the wind we have decided on a precautionary evacuation," Halandri mayor Simos Roussos told ERT. "The fire is very close."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities opened the Olympic stadium in northern Athens and other stadiums to house thousands of people evacuated from the path of the blaze. Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a biblical catastrophe," said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. "Our whole town is engulfed in flames," he told the Skai television channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said. Another hospital was evacuated during the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The destruction revived memories of the Mati disaster, the coastal area near Marathon where 104 people died in July 2018 in a tragedy later blamed on evacuation delays and errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summer wildfire season in Greece this year has seen dozens of daily blazes after the Mediterranean country recorded its warmest winter and the hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures around Athens were forecast to peak at 39 degrees Celsius on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 50 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias issued a warning on Saturday that half the country faced a high risk of fires due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday he said that a fire that broke out on Sunday near the town of Varnavas had spread even though a water-bombing aircraft reached the area within five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working 24-hour shifts, all of us," said fireman Marinos Peristeropoulos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fire spread very quickly because of the strong wind," he said near one of the hotspots in Grammatiko.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parts of Europe are also struggling with high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of France rose above 40 Celsius on Sunday. In Rome, temperatures were expected to reach 38 Celsius Monday and remain around 36 Celsius this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, temperatures between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius are expected. (AFP)

    Ex-Olympic diving champion Tom Daley retires

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tom Daley, (right), who won silver in Paris with Noah Williams, says he now wants to spend time with his husband and two children. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765919_1_20240812232925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Olympic gold medallist Tom Daley said on Monday it was the "right time" to retire as Britain's most successful diver walked away from the sport following the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Daley, who won five Olympic medals during his decorated career, revealed the decision to call time on the sport during an interview with British Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old bowed out after winning silver in the Olympic men's synchronised 10m platform in France, having clinched the gold medal in the same event at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to make the decision at some point, and it feels like the right time. It's the right time to call it a day," Daley said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley emerged as the star of British diving after first competing at the Olympics in the 2008 Beijing Games aged just 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London in the 10m platform, as well as bronze in the men's synchronised 10m platform in Rio 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley had effectively retired after his gold medal success in Tokyo, before deciding to return for a fifth Olympics in Paris in order to compete in front of his two children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He decided ahead of the event that he would stop diving competitively once he stepped out of the pool in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels very, very surreal. I felt so incredibly nervous going into this, knowing it was my last Olympics," he told Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was a lot of pressure and expectations. I was eager for it to be done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But when I walked out, and saw my husband (Lance) and kids (Robbie and Phoenix) and my friends and family in the audience, I was like, you know what? This is exactly why I did this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was emotional at the end, up there on the platform, knowing it was going to be my last competitive dive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley's gold in Tokyo came alongside Matty Lee and he was back to defend his title in Paris after being convinced by his six-year-old son Robbie to return to the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley and partner Noah Williams claimed silver in the competition, finishing behind China a fortnight ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking forward to spending more time with his family away from the Olympic spotlight, Daley has no fears he will regret retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to be with my family. I'm really excited to be able to spend some time with them and just be able to feel a bit normal for a couple of days," said Daley, who fulfilled a childhood dream by becoming the first diver to be a British flag bearer in the Olympic opening ceremony in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's always hard when you say goodbye to your sport. Lots of things to process, but I think it's the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year felt like such a bonus and I got to compete in front of my family, my kids. I got to be a flag bearer. So yeah, bucket list ticked off on every occasion." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan is on a visit to Hangzhou. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765914_1_20240812215848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Monday said the government is considering loosening the eligibility criteria of one of its talent schemes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, people who graduated from the top 100 universities or institutions in designated world rankings can apply for a work visa in Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in Hangzhou, Chan said the government is reviewing the scheme to possibly include more universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are some universities whose subjects may not be in the top 100 in the world, yet they are popular and very good. We are currently reviewing the scheme to see if these universities should be added to the scheme," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can never have too many talent. The more talent there are, the more useful they will be to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan is joining a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme visiting the capital of Zhejiang province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have participated in quite a lot of activities under the programme, but all of them were held in Hong Kong," he said during the welcoming dinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is also my first time to leave Hong Kong with our fellow students for the mainland. I am looking forward to visiting Hangzhou Branch of the National Archives of Publications and Culture with you all tomorrow, to learn about the rich history of our country and Zhejiang."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan will also meet with leaders of Hangzhou and Zhejiang to discuss deepening cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy mayor of Hangzhou, Xu Weihua, highlighted Hong Kong's role as Hangzhou's largest source of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As of the end of last year, Hong Kong companies had invested in 8,278 projects in Hangzhou, with a total investment of US$256.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are 56 businesses from Hangzhou that are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In fact, it's not an easy feat. There are 305 publicly listed companies in Hangzhou in total, and one-sixth of them are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said he hopes more reciprocal visits between Hangzhou and Hong Kong would take place, and the two cities would explore deeper collaboration and exchanges in areas such as trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said the five-day trip will be a very valuable experience for the youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who's now an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club, is also taking part in the trip.

  On Sunday, voting was held for Election Committee members, with more than 5,500 people choosing 344 out of 348 candidates. Turnout was 88.12 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau lawmakers and deputies to the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are among the other 56 Election Committee members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They form a 400-member Election Committee that will be responsible for nominating and electing the new-term chief executive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incumbent Ho Iat-seng has not indicated yet if he will seek re-election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the law, the Macau chief executive must be a Chinese citizen who is a permanent resident of the SAR, at least 40 years old, has ordinarily resided in Macau for a continuous period of 20 years, supports the Basic Law, and is loyal to the People's Republic of China and the Macau SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday urged all sides in the Ukraine war to de-escalate as Kyiv's forces pierced deep into Russia's Kursk border region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault seemed to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army on Sunday appearing to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the offensive, Beijing on Monday urged all parties to follow "three principles for de-escalating the situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those are "no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fuelling the flame by any party", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China will continue to maintain communication with the international community and play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the crisis," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing released a paper last year calling for a political settlement to the conflict. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday urged Hongkongers in Japan to be careful after the country's authorities warned a "megaquake" was possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japanese officials issued their first ever megaquake advisory last Thursday after a 7.1-magnitude quake hit the south of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR administration said Hongkongers in Japan should exercise caution, attend to their personal safety and pay attention to announcements on the latest situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation. It urged any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or the Chinese Embassy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested a 27-year-old man after finding more than 200 kilogrammes of cocaine in a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the haul has a street value of HK$175 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrest was made in Lok Ma Chau on Saturday and officers said the suspect is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said the flat where the drugs were found had recently been rented out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would like to make an appeal here, especially to large property owners. If they notice potential tenants who seem extremely eager to rent these units or even request renting immediately after a quick look around, they should be extra cautious and pay attention to their backgrounds," he said.

 Mainland authorities on Monday said six people have died and 10 others were injured after a lightning strike caused a park pavilion to collapse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People were seeking shelter from the rain under the pavilion in the city of Changzhou in Jiangsu province on Sunday night when lightning struck the structure, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Search and rescue efforts went late into the night, with all 16 people rushed to the hospital, but six of them who suffered severe injuries later died despite extensive rescue efforts. The rest of them are in stable condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported that authorities there will conduct a comprehensive review of public facilities to ensure safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains across the east and south, and much of the north sweltering in successive heat waves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, heavy rain in Shaanxi province caused a highway bridge to collapse, killing at least 38 people. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    DAB calls for register of subdivided units

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday urged the government to set up a system to register subdivided flats in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as the government is preparing a report on ways to address substandard accommodation, including setting minimum standards for subdivided units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB members visited more than 20 subdivided flats as part of a study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party is proposing that subdivided flats should have a minimum area of seven square metres and a minimum height of 1.8 metres and must comply with building and fire safety regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said that for safety reasons, the kitchen and bathroom in these flats should be separate, adding that the government should prioritise eliminating unsafe subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen quite a lot of fire accidents, some of the poor subdivided units don't have windows and fire protection... this makes it quite dangerous for the people who live inside," said lawmaker Vincent Cheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also says residents of units deemed to be unacceptable should be provided with rehousing options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [residents] live in a very poor subdivided unit, they can choose to move into transitional housing," said Cheng.

    Pest that strips trees bare now on HK Island: expert

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pest which ravages the leaves of trees like the Chinese banyan leaving them bare is increasing being found on Hong Kong Island after spreading from other parts of the territory in the hot weather, an expert warned on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Larvae of the Phauda flammans moth feed on the leaves of ficus trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The insect was a rare sight in the SAR until around 2019 when it appeared in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, according to Ken So, chief executive of The Conservancy Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the number of trees on Hong Kong Island affected by the pest is increasing, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For insects, because the life cycle can be shortened or the reproduction of insects can always be affected by weather conditions, particularly talking about the temperature. Higher temperatures would favour the reproduction or growth of insects. So likely, the problem of Phauda flammans is highly related to hotter weather," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said pesticides can be used to control the insect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the larvae eat the leaves with pesticides, then it will kill the larvae, so that it stops or terminates the life cycle of the insects," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So added that professionals are also developing a trap specifically for Phauda flammans.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two of the appellants, Margaret Ng (left) and Martin Lee (right), attended the hearing at the Court of Final Appeal. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765839_1_20240812115111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has unanimously dismissed a final attempt by Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers to overturn their convictions for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai, Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the procession on August 18, which followed an approved anti-police demonstration led by the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a lower court earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, it upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final appeal had centred on the issue of "operational proportionality", a principle set out by two decisions of Britain's Supreme Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appellants argued that the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, and that a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But judges at the Court of Final Appeal on Monday rejected the argument that the arrest, prosecution, conviction and sentence must be separately justified as proportionate, saying a separate proportionality inquiry was "inappropriate and uncalled for".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defendants' convictions and consequent sentences do not stand alone. They are the result of the judge applying the law to the evidence and being satisfied individually of their guilt," the ruling said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The same pertains to the defendants' proposition in respect of arrest and prosecution. Those actions similarly do not occur in isolation. They represent steps taken to enforce particular offence-creating laws."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the presiding judges, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung and Roberto Ribeiro, said the two British legal precedents cited by the appellants "should not be followed in Hong Kong" because of differences between the two jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, statutory and other provisions which are found to be unconstitutional may be struck down as invalid whereas in the UK, a provision that is declared to be incompatible continues to be enforced as a valid law, with potentially different issues regarding proportionality arising thereafter," the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow justice Johnson Lam added that there is no basis in the SAR to consider the prosecution, conviction and sentence as "distinct, standalone restrictions" from the rule creating the offence relating to freedom of assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord David Neuberger of Abbotsbury, a non-permanent judge from Britain, said the constitutional differences in Hong Kong and the UK "do not mandate a different approach when it comes to considering whether a restriction on the freedom of assembly is proportionate", but they "do require a different approach if the court concludes that the restriction is not proportionate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who attended the hearing, said it was not appropriate to comment on the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't had a chance to look at this very important judgement. This is not the right time to make comments. We just want to take this occasion to thank our legal teams and all the people who have been supporting us all the time," she said outside the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, left the court saying he had "no comment".

  Kenneth Chiu from the museum said around 100 meteors per hour are expected between 11:30pm on Monday and 5am on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said Clear Water Bay will be one of the best locations for seeing them.

  <br/>
  "If the weather is suitable for watching, we would suggest people go to the extremely dark and also the wide sky area to watch the meteor shower. And the suggested area that's actually in the kite-flying area, Tai Mei Tuk and Clear Water Bay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu also said the museum will livestream the meteor shower on its YouTube channel, while offering insights into the astronomical aspects of the shooting stars.
