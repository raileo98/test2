<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull on Wednesday unveiled its eight-rider cycling team to debut in this week's Tour de France, marking the energy drink maker's latest expansion of its sports empire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, Red Bull bought a controlling stake in the German Bora-Hansgrohe cycling team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The arrival of Red Bull in cycling... it's really huge. I think we have so much potential in the future with this joint venture," said team manager Ralph Denk at the official launch of the team at Red Bull's Hangar-7 facility in the Austrian city of Salzburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a clear plan to become the most attractive brand in cycling," said Denk when asked about his vision for the new team, adding that this would include finding "icon riders" and focussing on the development of young talents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team will compete in dark-blue jerseys prominently featuring the drink maker's logo and ride "super aero" bikes in white.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will be led by Slovenia's veteran all-rounder Primoz Roglic, who has previously won the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espana and also claimed his second Criterium du Dauphine earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former ski jumper Roglic left Jumbo-Visma to ride for Bora, starting 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's entry as a new sponsor "is a game changer or a big change for the whole [sport of] cycling," said Roglic, whose new contract is said to be worth six million euros [US$6.4 million] a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star-packed Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe roster for the world's biggest cycling race also includes Australian former Giro winner Jai Hindley and Russian Aleksandr Vlasov.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour de France starts in Florence on Saturday and is expected to be a four-way struggle spearheaded by bitter rivals Tadej Pogacar from Slovenia and Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard across a route designed to take the world's greatest bike race down to the wire. (AFP)

    Raducanu saves match point, Keys advances

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Raducanu reacts during her second round match against Jessica Pegula. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759216_1_20240627081335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Emma Raducanu registered her first-ever victory over a top-10 player at the Eastbourne International on Wednesday, saving a match point on the way to upsetting second seed Jessica Pegula as Madison Keys cruised through.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu edged a tight second-set tie-break to level the match against her American opponent and held her nerve to win 4-6, 7-6 [8/6], 7-5 after a major wobble in the decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raducanu, who missed the entire grass-court season last year following surgery, opted not to play in qualifying for the French Open or at the Paris Olympics but has a wild card for Wimbledon, which starts next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raducanu, who saved a match point in the second-set tie-break, appeared to be cantering towards victory when she led 5-2 in the third set but Pegula, who won the Berlin grass-court tournament last week, broke twice to level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former British number one, now ranked 168th in the world, carved out a break of her own to edge ahead again and survived a clutch of break points to seal the win, setting up a quarter-final tie with Daria Kasatkina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending champion and fourth seed Keys beat Ukrainian qualifier Anhelina Kalinina 7-6 [7/5], 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American will next face 2023 French Open finalist Karolina Muchova, who is playing her first tournament for nine months, after the Czech eased past Polish qualifier Magda Linette 6-4, 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Katie Boulter continued her fine form on grass by putting out fifth seed and former champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-4, 7-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British number one, who won the Nottingham tournament earlier this month, will take on third seed Jasmine Paolini in the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's event, Australia's Aleksandar Vukic put out third seed Alexander Bublik 6-4, 6-4 while fourth seed Sebastian Baez exited in straight sets at the hands of Miomir Kecmanovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese teenager Shang Juncheng beat Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 and will meet top seed and two-time American former champion Taylor Fritz, who produced a serving masterclass to defeat Thiago Seyboth Wild 7-6 [7/4], 6-3. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Georgia players celebrate qualifying for the knockout stages. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759210_1_20240627080825.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia secured a historic place in the knockout stages of Euro 2024 after a stunning 2-0 win over Portugal on Wednesday, while Turkey, Belgium, Romania and Slovakia all advanced to the last 16 as the group stage came to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Appearing at their first European Championship, Georgia had to record their first ever victory at the tournament to reach the last 16 when they played Portugal in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal had already qualified for the last 16 as Group F winners, and their coach Roberto Martinez made eight changes to his team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia went ahead inside the opening two minutes thanks to a fine finish from their star player, Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georges Mikautadze, who set up that goal, made it 2-0 from the penalty spot early in the second half to become the competition's top scorer on three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia, ranked 74th in the world, will now play much-fancied Spain in the next round on Sunday in Cologne, having progressed as one of the four best third-placed sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey finished second in the same group after a 2-1 win over the Czech Republic in Hamburg, as their opponents were eliminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cenk Tosun's goal in stoppage time sealed the victory for Turkey, who had been playing with an extra man since the 20th-minute sending-off of Antonin Barak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hakan Calhanoglu's superb strike put Turkey ahead early in the second half, before Tomas Soucek levelled for the Czechs, for whom Tomas Chory was also shown red after the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will play Austria in the last 16 in Leipzig next Tuesday, while 2016 champions Portugal go to Frankfurt for a game on Monday against Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, in a dramatic finish to Group E, war-torn Ukraine were left heartbroken as they went out despite picking up four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania's 1-1 draw with Slovakia secured the point they both needed to progress, while Ukraine's brave effort in a 0-0 draw with Belgium was not enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four sides ended the section on four points, but Ukraine paid for their 3-0 defeat to Romania in their opening game as they finished bottom on goal difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium could be made to pay for making a meal of a group they were expected to cruise as Domenico Tedesco's men will face France in the last 16 after finishing second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia advance as one of the best third-placed sides and will meet England next in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania will take on the Netherlands in the last 16. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher after a choppy session on Wednesday that saw big moves in some individual stocks after corporate earnings, with FedEx rising and General Mills tumbling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shipping giant FedEx surged 15.5 percent after reporting earnings that topped estimates following job cuts and other measures to cull expenses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But General Mills slid 4.6 percent as it reported a six percent drop in quarterly sales while price inflation hits demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up less than 0.1 percent at 39,127.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,477, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.5 percent to 17,805.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was not a heavy input day in terms of new news," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, who pointed to Friday's PCE pricing data as the week's most anticipated report owing to its implications for the Federal Reserve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Rivian Automotive soared more than 12 percent after announcing that Volkswagen would invest up to US$5 billion in the electric vehicle maker, establishing a joint venture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whirlpool jumped 17.1 percent following a Reuters report that German engineering company Robert Bosch is weighing a takeover bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderna fell 11 percent following clinical testing showing that the efficacy of the company's RSV vaccine fell sharply after the first year. (AFP)

    US says Assange, now free, had put people in 'danger'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Julian Assange gives a huge thumbs up after arriving at Canberra Airport. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759193_1_20240627022726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US State Department on Wednesday renewed its allegation that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange put people at risk for revealing secrets, after he was freed in a plea deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department – that included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world – whose positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also chilled the ability of American personnel to build relationships and have frank conversations," Miller said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian agreed to plea guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information and was sentenced to the time he had served in London – five years and two months – and given his liberty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange has become a hero for activists who point to his role in divulging information about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but critics fault him for putting out vast quantities of government documents without any filtering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miller said that the State Department at the time "had to scramble to get people out of danger, to move them out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pressed on whether anyone was harmed in the end, Miller said, "If you drive drunk down the street and get pulled over for drunk driving, the fact that you didn't crash into another car and kill someone doesn't get you out of the reckless actions and the endangerment that you put your fellow citizens in." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The yen, weakened by the Japanese government's easy monetary policy, hit a 38-year low against the US dollar on Wednesday, sparking speculation about a new intervention by authorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stocks were mostly lower despite a tech rebound that helped the Nasdaq edge into positive territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen slid as far as 160.75 to the greenback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite sliding through the 160 level, there was no indication that authorities had intervened to support the yen, said market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This being the case, it's possible that traders work to push the yen lower in a renewed attempt to test the resolve of the Japanese authorities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's top currency official has said authorities were ready to act 24 hours a day if the unit fell too far, but some investors suspect that the new trigger may be 165 yen to the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billions were pumped in to support the yen after it hit a 34-year low of 160.17 in late April, but with limited effect. (AFP)

    Nato names Dutch PM Rutte as next boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mark Rutte finally clinched the job last week when his sole challenger, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, dropped out. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759184_1_20240626233925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato's 32 nations on Wednesday appointed outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the alliance's next chief, handing him the job at a crucial moment with Russia on the march in Ukraine and US elections looming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rutte will take over from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on October 1 after major powers – spearheaded by the United States – agreed on his nomination ahead of a summit of Nato leaders in Washington next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader and a consensus-builder," Stoltenberg said on social media after Nato ambassadors approved the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know I am leaving Nato in good hands," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte said it was a "tremendous honour" to take over from Stoltenberg once his decade at the helm of Nato ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The alliance is and will remain the cornerstone of our collective security. Leading this organisation is a responsibility I do not take lightly," he posted online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seasoned Dutch leader, whose 14-year tenure leading the Netherlands is set to end within weeks, is seen as a safe pair of hands capable of stewarding Nato through perilous times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment was welcomed by leaders across the 75-year-old alliance, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who called it "a good choice for freedom and security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden believed Rutte "will make an excellent secretary general."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the 57-year-old faces the possibility of a possible return by former US president Donald Trump to the White House, who has long criticised the alliance, Rutte will also have to grapple with the threat posed by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After staking a claim for the Nato post following the collapse of his Dutch coalition government last year, Rutte had to use all his diplomatic skills to win over reluctant allies Turkey and Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finally clinched the race last week when his sole challenger, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, dropped out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A staunch supporter of Ukraine, the straight-talking Dutchman has spearheaded a push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets to help beat back Russia's assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Nato chief he will play a key role in marshalling allies to keep backing the war-torn country – while treading a fine line over Kyiv's push to join the alliance. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tuesday's protests led to the deaths of more than 20 people. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759183_1_20240626233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenyan President William Ruto said on Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would "be withdrawn," dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people died and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposed to the legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But he warned that the withdrawal of the finance bill would mean a significant shortfall in funding for development programmes designed to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others, as the East African nation struggles to lower its foreign debt burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn," Ruto told a press briefing, adding: "The people have spoken."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's administration has been taken by surprise by the intensity of opposition to its tax hikes, with protests breaking out across the country last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largely peaceful rallies turned violent on Tuesday when lawmakers passed the legislation and police fired live rounds into crowds that ransacked the partly ablaze parliament complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it had recorded 22 deaths and 300 injured victims, adding that they would launch an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frustration over the rising cost of living spiralled last week as lawmakers began debating the bill containing the tax hikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's cash-strapped government said the increases were needed to service the country's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings (US$78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of Kenya's GDP. (AFP)

 The police said they have arrested a man suspected of trying to kill his wife and three daughters by burning charcoal at a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspect was detained at a guesthouse in Mong Kok on Wednesday evening and is accused of attempted murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours earlier, officers received a report from the man's wife saying that she and the three girls, aged between 13 and 16, were feeling dizzy due to smoke in a flat in Shan King Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were taken to hospital and are said to be in satisfactory condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they suspect the woman's husband left the flat after setting the charcoal alight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press briefing, Sum Ho-min, chief crime inspector of Tuen Mun division, said officers believe the suspect was having financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the Social Welfare Department will follow up on the case.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said they have seized more than 60,000 sports items, including footballs, jerseys and footwear, during a three-week operation combating counterfeit goods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hauls, worth more than HK$50 million in total, led to the arrests of nine people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting head of customs' intellectual property investigation bureau, Peggy Tam, said the market was flooded with merchandise in the run-up to international sports events such as the Paris Olympics, and criminals made use of this to push out their counterfeit goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam urged people to only buy products from shops with a good reputation, warning that counterfeit items sold online are often of poor quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisional commander So Kim-fai from the bureau said people buying sports jerseys should pay attention to various details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly, the material used for counterfeit jerseys is not breathable. Secondly, some hang tags of counterfeit jerseys do not have a laser tag. Thirdly, the embroidery on counterfeit jerseys is cruder, with blurrier text. The embroidery on genuine jerseys is much clearer and more sophisticated," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some genuine jerseys also feature special designs on, for example, the sleeves, that counterfeit jerseys don't have."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong official on Wednesday scotched rumours that the East Rail Line will be extended into Shenzhen, with a "co-location" immigration clearance arrangement put in place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports earlier this year cited a mainland official as saying such a plan could be on the cards, as the Shenzhen side of the Lo Wu crossing is being redeveloped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But asked about the reports in Legco, Security Secretary Chris Tang said there is no plan to extend the MTR line into the Luohu district of Shenzhen, or bring in a co-location arrangement like the one in place for high-speed rail passengers at West Kowloon Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the government understands that Shenzhen authorities will soon carry out modification works on their side of the border crossing to "eliminate safety hazards, improve the port's functions, and upgrade the inspection facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the work to be carried out will not change the overall layout of the facilities and once completed, the time for immigration clearance on the Hong Kong side will not be affected.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Wednesday said a series of measures by the Hospital Authority (HA) to train and retain medical staff has been successful, with more doctors serving in the public sector and a drop in the resignation rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in the Legislative Council, Lo said the number of doctors increased by 260 in the 2023-24 year compared to the year before, while the resignation rate dropped to 5.2 percent, from 8.1 percent in 2021-22.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also told lawmakers that the hiring of medical practitioners from outside Hong Kong is going well, with 144 non-locally trained doctors working for the authority as of the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our estimation, because of our enhanced efforts to recruit non-locally trained doctors, by the end of this year we expect 250 non-locally trained doctors joining the HA to alleviate the burden on the public healthcare system," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced a new batch of recognised medical qualifications under the Medical Registration Ordinance, involving 28 courses at 20 non-local universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the universities are on the mainland – Capital Medical University, Fudan University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Sun Yat-sen University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The others are in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the ordinance, non-locally trained doctors who have a recognised medical qualification can apply for special registration to practise in Hong Kong.

    New 3D scanners to speed up airport luggage checks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Officials say the new CT X-ray scanners will help security personnel see more clearly if people have prohibited items in their luggage. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759111_1_20240626145855.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some people flying out of Hong Kong won't need to take out their electronic devices and liquids during security checks from July 2, as new CT X-ray machines are introduced at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new machines to check luggage will first be used at four of the 35 security screening lanes for departures from Terminal 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By using a CT X-ray machine it can provide a 3D image to the screener. With the 3D image, the screener can help [security personnel] to make a better and quicker decision on whether the screened package is okay to pass through the screening process,” said executive director of airport operations Steven Yiu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can increase the hourly throughput from the current 240 to 360 [people]. So this is almost a 50 percent increase in capacity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New full-body scanners will also be introduced in the lanes with the new CT X-ray machines, for those who set off the metal detectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Normally, we require the passenger to go through the metal detector. When he/she triggers the alarm, the security operator will use the hand-held screener to do a second-tier check,” Yiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now, we'll replace it with a full-body scanner, reducing the contact between the person and our security officer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said they will gradually replace all the older X-ray machines and install the new full-body scanners in all security lanes in Terminal 1 departures as well as in transit areas, as part of a project costing more than HK$800 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 2,000 food outlets and stores across Hong Kong will offer discounts to celebrate July 1, with a lawmaker stressing that the concessions are not aimed at boosting business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 29 percent discount will apply to designated menu items under the initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shops that have agreed to take part include convenience stores and major chains like Maxim's, Cafe de Coral and Tai Hing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not doing this to increase our sales. This is part of a celebration," said catering sector lawmaker Tommy Chueng on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is not how much business we do. It is contributing so that everybody will be happy come July 1 when you go out to eat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawmaker also said that asking eateries to give an across-the-board discount would discourage them from offering cheaper food and drink items.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to take 29 percent off your bill and be able to pay rent, your salaries and all your food costs," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association, said the discounts are coming at a good time, because more mainland residents are now able to travel to the SAR through the Individual Visit Scheme.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau says that around 60 percent of patients who seek accident and emergency services at public hospitals are classified as semi- or non-urgent cases. Photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759084_1_20240626123001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau says an ongoing review of accident and emergency charges at public hospitals is looking at how to focus resources on those patients who are most in need.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan suggested in January that the fees for various public services should be increased to offset the government's deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said about 60 percent, or 1.3 million, A&E visits each year are classified as semi-urgent or non-urgent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With each patient costing HK$2,400 on average, that means the government is spending HK$2 billion annually on patients who do not have a genuine need for emergency services, the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The money spent at public hospitals is funded by taxpayers, so we need to make sure it is used prudently," Lo told reporters in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to point out that the government is currently subsidising almost 97 percent of costs at public hospitals. That means users are paying less than four percent of the actual bill for their services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo emphasised that the government will not scale back healthcare funding, and said some patients may enjoy reduced fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are also identifying groups who require more financial resistance, such as cancer patients who fork out hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for medication, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, Lo pledged to conduct a "systemic" review after a string of medical incidents at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He floated some possible solutions, including strengthening an incentive and penalty mechanism for staff, and boosting accountability among management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having someone step down does not mean the problem is solved," he said, adding that resignations could further exacerbate the manpower shortage at public hospitals.

    N Korea trash balloons disrupt Incheon Airport

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Takeoff and landing at South Korea's Incheon international airport was disrupted on Wednesday for about three hours before dawn because of balloons launched by North Korea filled with refuse, an airport spokesperson said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One balloon landed on the tarmac near passenger Terminal 2 and the three runways at Incheon were temporarily shut down, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has flown balloons carrying trash into South Korea since late May, with hundreds landing in South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several balloons were spotted in and around the airport boundaries, the spokesperson said, adding that this was not the first time operations at the airport – which is about 40km from the North Korean border – had been disrupted by balloons nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disruption to domestic and international flights occurred between 1.46am and 4.44am, and the runways have re-opened since then, Incheon International Airport Corporation said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has said the balloons are retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in the South who regularly send over balloons carrying food, medicine, money and leaflets criticising the North's leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the items carried by the North Korean balloons have been articles printed with Hello Kitty characters, badly worn clothing, and soil containing traces of human faeces and parasites, South Korea has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, North Korea test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile off its east coast on Wednesday, but it exploded in midair, South Korea's military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The missile was launched from near the capital, Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Japan's Defence Ministry said the missile flew to an altitude of about 100km and range of more than 200km. (Reuters)

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759068_1_20240626104312.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell by 1.2 percent in May, according to official data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drop followed two consecutive months of increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices in May were 12.7 percent lower than the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed a one percent increase in rental prices, which reached a four-and-a-half year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the first time home prices have reported a decrease since Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, the director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, said the effects of the end of the "spicy" measures have now worn off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There seems to be no positive factors apart from the cooling measures news. Because currently the home prices are still being impacted by two negative factors," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first one is the high interest rate environment and the second one is the ample supply for new units. As long as these two factors continue to impact the market, it will stop the home prices from rebounding quickly."

    Assange leaves US court after plea accepted

<div class="itemFullText">
 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange left a US court in Saipan where he was freed in a landmark plea deal on Wednesday, but did not address reporters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 52-year-old was seen leaving the court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a Pacific US territory, by car. He will now fly to Canberra in his native Australia, WikiLeaks said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Jen Robinson hailed Wednesday as a "historic day" after Assange was freed by the US court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a historic day. It brings to an end 14 years of legal battles," she told reporters outside the court in Saipan. "It also brings to an end a case which has been recognised as the greatest threat to the First Amendment in the 21st century."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WikiLeaks founder has long been wanted by Washington for revealing military secrets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the three-hour hearing, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents but said he had believed the US Constitution's First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information," he told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was ... a violation of the espionage statute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief US District Judge Ramona V Manglona accepted his guilty plea and released him due to time already served in a British jail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With this pronouncement, it appears that you will be able to walk out of this courtroom a free man," she said. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England grounded out a 0-0 draw with Slovenia to claim top spot in Group C and avoid a last-16 meeting with hosts Germany, but France face a complicated path to the final after failing to beat Poland on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gareth Southgate's side have struggled to find their best form in the tournament and delivered another unimpressive performance in Cologne, one that will do little to silence the mounting criticism back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was still enough to advance as group winners though after an equally turgid 0-0 draw between Denmark and Serbia in Munich, which saw the Danes finish second ahead of Slovenia despite an identical record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England must wait to find out which of the four best third-placed teams they will meet in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday for a place in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark pipped Slovenia to the runners-up spot by virtue of a better qualifying ranking after both nations finished with three draws, the same goal difference, number of goals scored and disciplinary points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany await Denmark in the last 16, while Slovenia celebrated reaching the knockout phase of a major tournament for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France blew the chance to finish first in their group despite Kylian Mbappe scoring his maiden goal from the spot in a 1-1 draw with Poland, as Austria won a thriller against the Netherlands to snatch top spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria, who lost their opening game to France, grabbed a 3-2 victory over the Dutch to wrap up a last-16 berth and relegate their already-qualified opponents to third place in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Les Bleus will face the runners-up from Group E in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result of coming second, France also now find themselves in the half of the draw with Germany, Spain and Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe -- playing in a mask after breaking his nose against Austria -- finally broke his Euros duck in the 56th minute, as he slotted in a penalty after Ousmane Dembele was felled by Jakub Kiwior.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Poland were awarded a spot-kick themselves with 13 minutes remaining for a foul on Karol Swiderski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Dutch fans turned Berlin orange as they continued to light up the tournament, it was the Austrians in full voice early on when Donyell Malen inadvertently fired into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Netherlands drew level less than two minutes after the restart, as Austria midfielder Florian Grillitsch lost the ball in midfield before Cody Gakpo cut inside and finished off a rapid counter-attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria reclaimed the lead as Romano Schmid's header found the net via a deflection off Stefan de Vrij on the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Memphis Depay struck with an excellent touch and volley to equalise again after a good header down by substitute Wout Weghorst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ralf Rangnick's men now have a match against either Turkey, the Czech Republic or Georgia as they bid to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands will play the winners of either Groups C or E. (AFP)

    US gun violence declared a 'public health crisis'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US surgeon general on Tuesday issued a landmark advisory declaring gun violence a "public health crisis" and calling for wide-ranging firearm controls that have historically been quashed by stiff political opposition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advisory by Vivek Murthy, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, is the first such major report on gun violence from a surgeon general, whose office has limited authority but plays a significant public role in health issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A similar report on tobacco in the 1960s was a key first step to altering the perception of the substance's danger, ultimately leading to new regulations and a steep decline in consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firearm violence is an urgent public health crisis that has led to loss of life, unimaginable pain, and profound grief for far too many Americans," Murthy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't have to continue down this path, and we don't have to subject our children to the ongoing horror of firearm violence in America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report cites government and other data that shows the United States is an extreme outlier on deaths and injuries from guns, especially for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firearms in recent years have become the leading cause of deaths for Americans aged 1-19, above motor vehicles, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the influential NRA gun rights organisation quickly slammed the advisory as "an extension of the Biden Administration's war on law-abiding gun owners."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "America has a crime problem caused by criminals," said Randy Kozuch, director the NRA's lobby arm, said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surgeon general's report said in 2022 over 48,000 people died as a result of firearms, disproportionately affecting black Americans and men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that suicides had increased by 20.1 percent from 2012-2022 and represented over half of gun-related deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will take the collective commitment of our nation to turn the tide on firearm violence," Murthy said, calling for investments in research, community education programmes, mental health support and tighter controls on buying guns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report also calls for mandating safe firearm storage, implementing universal background checks and banning assault weapons. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Tuesday, as Nvidia reversed a recent decline to finish the day almost seven percent higher, pushing up the Nasdaq.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed down 0.8 percent at 39,112, while the S&P 500 closed 0.4 percent higher at 5,469.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq was the top performing major index on Wall Street, closing up 1.3 percent at 17,717.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors also digested consumer confidence data published on Tuesday, which showed that consumers in the United States have become slightly less optimistic about the state of the world's largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next major data release comes on Friday, when the Fed's favoured inflation gauge is published, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal expecting a slight decline in the annual rate at which prices are rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically all eyes are on the inflation," said Spartan Capital Securities chief economist Peter Cardillo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, Nvidia surged 6.8 percent, reversing course after a disappointing run, while cruise ship companies Carnival and Norwegian rose by 8.7 percent and 5.1 percent respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of the table, the swimming pool supply company Pool Corp saw its share price fall by eight percent after slashing its guidance for the year. (AFP)

    Top Spanish court says 'stolen kiss' is sexual assault

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former football federation chief Luis Rubiales faces trial for kissing star player Jenni Hermoso on the lips after Spain beat England to win the World Cup last year. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759024_1_20240626003012.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that a kiss without "tacit consent" can be considered sexual assault just months before former football federation chief Luis Rubiales will stand trial over his unsolicited kiss at the Women's World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling from the southern region of Andalusia which convicted a police officer of sexual assault and sentenced him to one year and nine months in jail for kissing a woman on the cheek who was in police custody.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A 'stolen kiss', and thus without express or implied consent, constitutes sexual assault in actuality," the court said, adding that "it is clear that the fleeting contact of a non-consensual kiss represents a bodily invasion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A 'no' from the victim is not necessary in the face of attempts to kiss a woman, but rather that for there not to be a crime, what is needed is consent. The key is consent, to the point that if consent has not been given, there has been sexual aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of whether an unsolicited kiss can be considered sexual assault is a hot topic in Spain since Rubiales provoked worldwide outrage by kissing star player Jenni Hermoso on the lips during the medal ceremony after Spain beat England to win the World Cup in Australia last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the time, Rubiales, 46, brushed it off as "a consensual" peck on the lips, but Hermoso, 34, said it was not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She filed a lawsuit against Rubiales in September, telling the judge she had come under pressure to defend him both on the flight back from Australia and on a subsequent team holiday to Ibiza in the Balearic Islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales is set to stand trial from February 3 to 19 over the kiss. Public prosecutors have requested a sentence of two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales – one year for sexual assault and 18 months for coercion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former federation chief, who quit his post last year in the wake of the controversy, told private Spanish television station La Sexta in April that he could not understand how it could be labelled as sexual assault, saying there was "no sexual context" to it. (AFP)

    Five shot dead as violent protests escalate in Kenya

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police opened fire on demonstrators trying to storm Kenya's legislature on Tuesday, with at least five protesters killed, dozens wounded and sections of the parliament building set ablaze as lawmakers inside passed legislation to raise taxes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In chaotic scenes, protesters overwhelmed police and chased them away in an attempt to storm the parliament compound, with Citizen TV reporting protesters had managed to enter the Senate chamber earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police opened fire after tear gas and water cannon failed to disperse the crowds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One eyewitness counted the bodies of at least five protesters outside parliament. A paramedic, Vivian Achista, said at least 10 had been shot dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another paramedic, Richard Ngumo, said more than 50 people had been wounded by gunfire. He was lifting two injured protesters into an ambulance outside parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to shut down parliament and every MP should go down and resign," protester Davis Tafari, who was trying to enter parliament, said. "We will have a new government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenyan activist Auma Obama, the half-sister of former US President Barack Obama, was among protesters tear-gassed during the demonstrations, a CNN interview showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police eventually managed to drive the protesters from the building amid clouds of tear gas and the sound of gunfire. The lawmakers were evacuated through underground tunnels, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Internet services across the country also experienced severe disruptions during the police crackdown, internet monitor Netblocks said. Kenya's leading network operator Safaricom said two undersea cables were out of action, causing the outages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests and clashes also took place in several other cities and towns across the country, with many calling for President William Ruto to quit office as well as voicing their opposition to the tax rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament approved the finance bill, moving it through to a third reading by lawmakers. The next step is for the legislation to be sent to the president for signing. He can send it back to parliament if he has any objections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto won an election almost two years ago on a platform of championing Kenya's working poor, but has been caught between the competing demands of lenders such as the International Monetary Fund, which is urging the government to cut deficits to obtain more funding, and a hard-pressed population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenyans have been struggling to cope with several economic shocks caused by the lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, two consecutive years of droughts and depreciation of the currency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance bill aims to raise an additional US$2.7 billion in taxes as part of an effort to lighten the heavy debt load, with interest payments alone consuming 37 percent of annual revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposition leader Raila Odinga called for the Finance Bill to be immediately and unconditionally withdrawn to make way for dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am disturbed at the murders, arrests, detentions and surveillance being perpetrated by police on boys and girls who are only seeking to be heard over taxation policies that are stealing both their present and future," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has already made some concessions, promising to scrap proposed new taxes on bread, cooking oil, car ownership and financial transactions. But that has not been enough to satisfy protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's protests began in a festival-like atmosphere but as crowds swelled, police fired tear gas in Nairobi's Central Business District and the poor neighbourhood of Kibera. Protesters ducked for cover and threw stones at police lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People clambered over police vehicles stalled in the downtown streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also fired tear gas in Eldoret, Ruto's hometown in western Kenya, where crowds of protesters filled the streets and many businesses were closed for fear of violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clashes also broke out in the coastal city of Mombasa and demonstrations took place in Kisumu, on Lake Victoria, and Garissa in eastern Kenya, where police blocked the main road to Somalia's port of Kismayu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Nairobi, people chanted "Ruto must go" and crowds sang in Swahili: "All can be possible without Ruto." Music played from loudspeakers and protesters waved Kenyan flags and blew whistles in the few hours before the violence escalated. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato will officially name outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the alliance's next head on Wednesday, after ambassadors from all 32 member countries greenlit his appointment, diplomats said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Diplomats from several Nato states said Rutte, who was strongly backed by leading power the United States, will take over from current secretary general Jens Stoltenberg when his term ends on October 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte, 57, last week sealed the race to lead the Western military alliance after lone challenger Romanian President Klaus Iohannis dropped out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seasoned Dutch leader, who is set to leave office in the Netherlands soon after almost 14 years in charge, will take the reins at a pivotal time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next Nato chief will have to grapple with the ongoing fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine and the potential return to the US presidency of Donald Trump after elections in November. (AFP)

    New law to boost infrastructure cybersecurity mooted

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Secretary for Security Chris Tang says the proposed legislative framework does not target individuals but large organisations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759011_1_20240625212402.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday proposed new legislation to enhance cybersecurity of critical infrastructures such as banks, railway systems and electricity suppliers, with operators required to report cybersecurity incidents and those who fail to comply fined up to HK$5 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a paper submitted to the Legislative Council by the Security Bureau, critical infrastructures are "facilities that are necessary for the maintenance of normal functioning of the Hong Kong society".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two major categories of critical infrastructures. The first covers facilities delivering "essential services" in eight sectors, namely energy, information technology, banking and financial services, land transport, air transport, maritime, healthcare services, as well as communications and broadcasting. The second includes "other infrastructures for maintaining important societal and economic activities", such as major sports and performance venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new commissioner's office under the Security Bureau will be set up to monitor operators and follow up on non-compliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed legislative framework, operators are required to set up a computer system security management unit, conduct a security risk assessment at least once every year and an independent security audit at least once every two years, and report serious security incidents within two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penalties ranging from HK$500,000 to HK$5 million will apply to organisations that fail to comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang said the proposal does not target individuals but large organisations, adding that it will not infringe people's freedom to use the internet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers will discuss the proposal in a security panel meeting on July 2, followed by a consultation period that will last for a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it hopes to table the bill to Legco by the end of this year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The book fair is themed on film and television literature this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year’s book fair said on Tuesday that they hope to attract visitors from around the world by showcasing props and manuscripts from popular Hong Kong movies and dramas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fair's theme this time will be film and television literature and the event will feature AI-generated movie images, as well as talks by the author of a book on the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government has been very active in promoting mega events and hoping to attract a lot of tourists as well as Greater Bay Area citizens to Hong Kong. So the book fair, I think we play a part in it,” said Sophia Chong, deputy executive director of the Trade Development Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s quite attractive in getting all the families and also the Greater Bay Area fans and even from Southeast Asia to come to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chong also said all exhibitors are aware of the need to comply with laws relating to national security, as well as other regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have been asking our exhibitors to observe the rules and regulations of the Hong Kong Book Fair… They have been very observant in observing all these rules and regulations and also the rules in Hong Kong, including the [National Security Law] as well as the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, will run from July 17 to July 23, with the Sports and Leisure Expo and the World of Snacks taking place at the venue at the same time.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Disney's managing director Michael Moriarty (second from right) says the resort's three hotels are also recovering well. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758982_1_20240625165135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Tuesday said it achieved record-breaking earnings in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the opening of its "World of Frozen" attraction last November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The first quarter of 2024 was our most successful quarter ever, achieving record-level revenues, [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] and net income. These results are our continued focus on creating the best place to work for our amazing cast members in the power of Disney brand and franchises," said the resort's managing director Michael Moriarty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland also noted its net loss had shrunk by 83 percent to HK$356 million in the fiscal year of October 2022 to September 2023 while year-on-year revenue grew by 156 percent to HK$5.7 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park attributed the boost to a strong rebound in both local and non-local travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total attendance last year grew by 87 percent to 6.4 million with the number of local visitors reaching a record-high, the company said, and a rebound in mainland China visitors was particularly strong, but there was also growth in visitor numbers from Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland had operated at a loss for nine fiscal years in a row, but Moriarty highlighted that the park actually turned profitable if the number was calculated from January to December 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we look at the fiscal year, I think you have to really look at it in two ways - there’s a lot of old news in there, and our losses that we suffered as a result of Covid are very similar to those during the previous years during Covid that everyone suffered through,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But as soon as the masks came off, our business took off. And literally, immediately out of the gate, we started to out-pace the market's recovery. And that's when we really started to turn profitable right away, in the summer of last fiscal year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that demand for the resort’s three hotels was also recovering strongly, with a more than 90 percent booking rate observed in the first three months of 2024.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday criticised a concern group for claiming that proposed changes to harbour protection laws would strip the courts of the power to adjudicate on controversies involving reclamation projects in Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Society for Protection of the Harbour had argued that legal changes aimed at making it easier for smaller reclamation projects to be carried out will shift gatekeeping powers from the courts to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Linn told lawmakers at a development panel meeting that such gatekeeping has always been carried out by the government and if the legal amendments are approved, people will still be able to challenge decisions by way of a judicial review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary said the default position will continue to be that large-scale reclamation in the harbour is banned unless there is an overriding public need for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Executive Council makes a decision on such a project, the public would have a chance to have their say on the matter, Linn added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary would make decisions on whether to allow smaller projects, or those that are only temporary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn stressed that the government has no plans to carry out large-scale reclamation in Victoria Harbour for housing, commercial or industrial developments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of the amendment is to improve harbourfront connectivity, enhance harbourfront areas for public enjoyment, or strengthen functions the harbour ought to have," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All the councillors at the meeting expressed their support for the proposed changes, with several saying they hope more facilities will be approved around the harbour to improve people's livelihoods.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled unanimously that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for military service, a decision that could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition as Israel continues to wage war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that in the absence of a law that distinguishes between Jewish seminary students and other draftees, Israel’s compulsory military service system applies to the ultra-Orthodox like any other citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under long-standing arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men have been exempt from the draft, which is compulsory for most Jewish men and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These exemptions have long been a source of anger among the secular public, a divide that has widened during the eight-month-old war, as the military has called up tens of thousands of soldiers and says it needs all the manpower it can get. Over 600 soldiers have been killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, key partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, oppose any change in the current system. If the exemptions are ended, they could bolt the coalition, causing the government to collapse and leading to new elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court decision comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza drags on into its ninth month and the number of dead soldiers continues to mount. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About half of Hong Kong's financial institutions are using virtual assets in their business operations, according to a report released on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) -- an affiliate of the Monetary Authority -- surveyed 59 entities, including those from the banking, insurance and asset management sectors between May and July last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey revealed that 53 percent of firms were using virtual assets, while 85 percent expected virtual assets to be part of their core business operations in the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the institute's head, Giorgio Valente, said financial institutions are cautious about the application of virtual assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the moment, because people are trying to understand how to maximise the benefits, while learning about its vulnerabilities, these elements obviously would actually impact the effective adoption. But going forward, we expect the situation eventually may improve," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente added that Hong Kong remained attractive as a virtual assets hub, as the SAR had a well-defined regulatory framework and robust financial infrastructure.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese lunar probe has returned to Earth with the first ever samples collected from the moon's far side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 touched down in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region shortly after 2pm on Tuesday, completing its complex and challenging 53-day lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The returner of [the] Chang'e-6 mission has landed successfully at Siziwang Banner, at the designated area. I would like to announce that the Chang'e-6 lunar mission has achieved a complete success," said Zhang Kejian, the director of the China National Space Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also extended his congratulations on the complete success of the lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a congratulatory message carried by state media, Xi said the "outstanding contributions" of the mission command "will be remembered forever by the motherland and the people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The re-entry capsule brought back lunar soil and rocks that it spent two days collecting by a drill and robotic arm from the side of the moon that faces away from Earth. It would be brought to Beijing for further studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang'e-6 blasted off from a space centre in Hainan on May 3, and descended into the moon's immense South Pole-Aitken Basin almost exactly a month later.

 National security police on Tuesday charged a man with writing words with seditious intention on the back of bus seats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said the writing, found on public buses in March and April, provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention", contravening Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was also charged with destroying or damaging property.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A DAB lawmaker on Tuesday called on the government to beautify Sham Shui Po, to attract more visitors to the district.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Vincent Cheng, who represents the Kowloon West geographical constituency, said businesses in Sham Shui Po are struggling to survive as more Hongkongers head north for tourism and shopping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said the government should begin with enhancing the appeal of Apliu Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apliu Street is one of the really historical streets. It's full of different kinds of electricity products, especially the old cameras, the old CDs, a lot of different musical stuff over there. So we do think there are a lot of visitors going around there every day. So we do think there's a good attraction," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, the government can have some promotion or revamp to make sure that everyone knows that Apliu Street is really good for the tourists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also suggested installing figures of the district's mascot, known as "Sham Duck", and renovating the "pai dong" hawker stalls in the area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Afghanistan reached the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup with a dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh under the Duckworth Lewis System in St Vincent on Monday, joining India as the qualifiers from Group 1 and sending Australia home.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh also had a chance to progress or send Australia through with a victory but the Afghans dismissed them for 105 to take the win they needed to set up a first World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Trinidad on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan hopes were dented when they were restricted to a modest 115-5 as showers around the ground threatened to change the calculations, but skipper Rashid Khan took 4-23 and Naveen-ul-Haq 4-26 in a defiant bowling effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, who beat Australia by 24 runs earlier in St Lucia to leave the qualification hopes of the 2021 champions hanging by a thread, will take on title holders England in the second semi-final in Guyana on Thursday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lacklustre Brazil launched their Copa America campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Costa Rica on Monday as James Rodriguez inspired Colombia to a 2-1 win over Paraguay in the other Group D game.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brazil, chasing a 10th Copa America crown, dominated possession and territory at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles but struggled to break down a resolute Costa Rica.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazilians thought they had taken the lead in the 30th minute after Marquinhos tapped in at the back post after a flick on by Rodrygo following a free-kick by Raphinha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after an agonising VAR delay, the goal was chalked off for a fractional offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costa Rica were content to sit back, defending in numbers and rarely venturing forward with any purpose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They failed to have a single shot on goal for the entire game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodriguez, whose club career has languished in the decade since he rose to prominence with a dazzling performance at the 2014 World Cup, created both of Colombia's goals at Houston in Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old midfielder, who has played just a handful of minutes for Brazilian club Sao Paulo in the two months leading into the Copa America, set up the opening goal for Colombia in the 32nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten minutes later Colombia doubled their lead and again it was a goal engineered by the trusty left foot of Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time the goal arrived from the opposite flank, with Rodriguez swinging in a wicked free-kick that was glanced in by Crystal Palace midfielder Jefferson Lerma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That made it 2-0 at half time to leave Colombia firmly on course to extend their unbeaten streak to 24 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia continued to carve out the better chances in the second half, but Paraguay set up a nervy finish after Brighton's Julio Enciso pulled one back in the 69th minute. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the upcoming July 1 holiday is a special day that people should celebrate freely, while warning of potential "undesirable activities".
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told reporters that he believed people would cherish the current safe and stable situation in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that people will celebrate July 1 happily. At the same time, we have to stay vigilant against undesirable activities taking place, say for example, activities that hijack this important date," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have stability, our security is safeguarded. I'm sure people will look forward to the celebrations. Police will take into account the situation and make arrangements as necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the absence of demonstrations on July 1, the chief executive said there are many ways and channels for people to express their opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee is set to lead a delegation of principal officials to Guangzhou on Thursday for an annual conference, with discussions on past achievements and future cooperation in areas such as innovation and technology, finance, and healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong would help contribute to the high-quality development of the Greater Bay Area, adding there were unlimited opportunities for both sides.

 Hong Kong airport officials must make improvements and ensure a glitch that affected many passengers over the weekend does not happen again, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, a computer malfunction paralysed real-time flight information updates on the airport's display screens, as well as on digital platforms, for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said although no flights had to be cancelled, the glitch affected a lot of passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that transport authorities immediately met Airport Authority management regarding the incident, and that airport bosses had been told to submit a detailed report to prevent similar incidents from happening in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have asked the Airport Authority to conduct a comprehensive review of the system, including its backup system, to upgrade its capacity in activating the system and to review its risk management measures amid the completion of the third runway system," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong International Airport is an international aviation hub. It is of paramount importance to provide high-quality and stable services to passengers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Preliminary findings showed there were issues with activating the authority's backup system following the glitch.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday said the Chinese economy had gotten off to a "good start" this year, and that the nation will continue to strive to create an open environment for technological innovations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li made the remarks at a keynote speech at the opening of a World Economic Forum meeting – also known as Summer Davos – in Dalian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said: "The rapid growth of new industries and new drivers has buttressed the sound and sustained development of the Chinese economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the start of this year the Chinese economy has sustained the momentum of recovery. It got off to a good start in the first quarter of this year... and continued steady growth in the second quarter. We're confident and capable in achieving the growth target of around five percent for this year," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also proposed that there should be a deepening of exchanges and cooperation in science and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Science and technology are key variables in future development and major sci-tech progress usually comes from unrelenting research accumulation and extensive cooperation," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier also told delegates that the nation's electric vehicles and lithium batteries were not only meeting domestic demand, but also enriching global supply amid trade tensions with the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 1,600 leading figures from the public and private sectors across nearly 80 countries and regions are attending the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions event which is being held until June 27. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that power company CLP must get to the bottom of a series of power outages in recent months, adding that he's highly concerned about the matter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said before the weekly Executive Council meeting that CLP needs to improve in a number of areas to ensure a stable and reliable power supply, which he stressed is important to the people and the territory's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary for CLP to identify the root causes of the problems, make fundamental improvements to reduce the chance of similar incidents in the future," the CE told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some systems may have been running for a long time, so it is important that they're always well-maintained, then there'll be a good system to ensure that periodic checks take place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said it is essential for the company to deploy more manpower to improve its response to emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials will follow up on CLP's plans to enhance its overall power supply system capabilities and reduce the risks brought by adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm had said that a voltage dip in the early hours of Sunday may have been caused by the weather.

    Florida win first Stanley Cup in franchise history

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Florida prevailed against Edmonton in what had been a grueling campaign for the two teams. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758916_1_20240625111548.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Florida Panthers dug deep against the Edmonton Oilers to win 2-1 in a closely-fought Game 7, ensuring their first ever Stanley Cup title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe scored goals for the home team while Sergei Bobrovsky made 23 saves on their way to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mattias Janmark had the goal for Edmonton and Stuart Skinner stopped 19 shots for the Oilers, but they couldn’t end Canada’s title drought in the tournament; it’s been 1993 and counting since a team based in Canada has won the Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Florida, it was the third title-round appearance in their 30-year history; they were swept in 1996 by Colorado and routed 4-1 by Vegas last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, they were on the right side of history — after avoiding what would have been a historic collapse. The Panthers won the first three games of the series, then lost the next three and needed a win on Monday to avoid joining the 1942 Detroit Red Wings as the only teams to lose the final after taking a 3-0 lead in the title round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn’t easy. Not even close. But it's done. It took until the very end for the Panthers to deny Connor McDavid his first title, and the Oilers what would have been their first Cup since 2006. (AP)

    HK to host world youth summit in August: Mak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alice Mak says August's youth summit will provide a platform for meaningful exchanges between people from all over the world. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758913_1_20240625105757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, said a summit would be held in August to provide an opportunity for young people from different places to come together and exchange ideas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, Mak said more than 1,000 youth leaders and speakers from different parts of the world, including the mainland, would be invited to the Youth Development Summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said young people attending the event could understand global development trends and plan their future effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main objective is to create a platform where people from different places can meet our outstanding young people. They can learn about the remarkable qualities and potential of our youth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, our young friends in Hong Kong will have the opportunity to interact with people from other cities and meet various youth leaders. This will enable them to broaden their horizons and foster more meaningful exchanges".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said the government was working well with district councils and care teams to provide comprehensive support to people living in different areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said district councillors and care teams regularly visit residents to understand their needs and find solutions to problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing the example of a deadly fire in Jordan in April, Mak said that without the cooperation between care teams and district councils, the government would not have been able to provide services to affected residents as efficiently and effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have more partners in the districts. We are no longer relying on the government's resources and capacity alone."

    'Julian Assange is free', has left Britain: WikiLeaks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Julian Assange's wife Stella on Tuesday thanked campaigners for their support as the WikiLeaks founder was released after five years in British custody.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Julian is free!!!!" she wrote on the social media platform X following confirmation that he had left Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Words cannot express our immense gratitude" to everyone who had backed the global push for his release, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stella Assange met the Australian publisher while he was holed up in Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges that were later dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange, accused of divulging US military secrets related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been due back in court in London next month after winning an appeal against extradition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But WikiLeaks said in a statement: "Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1,901 days there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stansted airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The media freedom group said sustained campaigning, from grassroots supporters to political leaders and the United Nations, "created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice", leading to a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation said the deal "has not yet been formally finalised".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange was initially detained for skipping bail in relation to the Swedish case and held in custody while the US extradition request wound its way through court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will now be reunited with his wife, whom he married at a ceremony in the prison, and their two young children, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "WikiLeaks published ground-breaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions," the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom. Julian's freedom is our freedom." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungary's forward Barnabas Varga had successful surgery on Monday after suffering a facial fracture in Sunday's 1-0 win over Scotland at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old suffered the injury when he clashed with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the box after 68 minutes and appeared to be knocked out, needing urgent medical attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was taken to hospital and was in a stable condition before his surgery on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information of the institution's doctors specialising in facial injuries, the intervention was uncomplicated, so the attacker ... can leave the hospital on Wednesday," the Hungarian football federation said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga's girlfriend shared a picture of her holding his hand in hospital with the message: "Thank you for the kind, supportive messages. Barni is over the surgery. A little rest awaits him, but everything will be fine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai had criticised medical staff for the length of time it took for Varga to get treatment on the pitch during the Group A game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga will not play any part in the rest of Hungary's campaign, should they qualify for the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win over Scotland ensured Hungary finished third in their group, but they must wait on other results to see if they qualify as one of the four best third-place finishers. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mattia Zaccagni kept Italy's European Championship title defence alive with an incredible late equaliser in the holder's thrilling 1-1 draw with Croatia, as Spain completed a perfect group stage and showed Albania the door.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Italy are in the last 16 of Euro 2024 after forward Zaccagni struck a superb equaliser with almost the last kick of the game in Leipzig, sparking an explosion of joy among the Italian fans and even a sprint up the line from 65-year-old coach Luciano Spalletti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Azzurri will play Switzerland in the next round thanks to Zaccagni, who came on with nine minutes remaining and curled in his leveller in the eighth minute of stoppage time following a brilliant burst and pass from defender Riccardo Calafiori.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody believed any more, but the players did," Spalletti told Sky Sport in Italy, before raging at critics in the Italian press pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a furious press conference Spalletti said "I inject myself with this venom" which he said was coming "from all sides" and blasted unnamed people within Italy's camp for potentially leaking his team's formation to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spalletti's team finish Group B in second place on four points, five behind winners Spain who beat Albania 1-0 thanks to a neat Ferran Torres finish in the 13th minute in Dusseldorf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albania's Euros adventure is over following a defeat which also means that England, France and the Netherlands are guaranteed a place in the next round at least as one of the four best third-placed teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia meanwhile are all-but out due to Zaccagni's late equaliser just as it looked as if Luka Modric was once again going to be the hero for his country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modric defied his advancing years by firing Croatia into the lead nine minutes after the break and becoming the oldest goalscorer in Euros history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 38 years and 289 days old, Modric broke the record set by Austrian Ivica Vastic in 2008, pouncing on a rebound after Gianluigi Donnarumma made an incredible save from Ante Budimir's point-blank range header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modric made up for Donnarumma pushing away his penalty just moments before, but his goal wasn't enough and on two points third-placed Croatia's hopes are hanging by a thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's hard when you lose like this to find the words to describe how you feel," said Modric. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has hit back at what it calls "unsubstantiated remarks" from the US State Department in its latest Trafficking in Persons Report, which said Hong Kong was actively being used by syndicates as a destination or transit point for human trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR government said it vehemently opposed and firmly rejected what it called unfounded and false remarks in the report about the situation in Hong Kong. The SAR statement said trafficking in persons was never a prevalent problem in the city, and there had never been any sign that Hong Kong was actively used by syndicates to conduct such activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the rating of Hong Kong as Tier 2 on its Watch List was "unfair, misconceived, and not substantiated by facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government said it had been making proactive and multi-pronged efforts in the fight against trafficking in persons, and had injected an enormous amount of resources into combating the issue, as well as enhancing protection for foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong. It said the government spared no effort in conducting initial screenings for all persons vulnerable to trafficking risks, including illegal immigrants, sex workers, illegal workers, helpers, imported labour and other suspected victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in 2023, it screened 11,000 people, representing an increase of 45 percent compared to the previous year. It found only three victims, which demonstrated that trafficking in persons wasn't prevalent or widespread in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said it would be baseless and unfair to cast doubt on the city's quality of screenings just because of the low number of the victims identified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also noted that in 2018, it established a high-level steering committee that provided policy on human trafficking and protection of foreign domestic helpers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mixed on Monday, with industrial companies lifting the Dow and a retreat by some of the hottest tech names weighing on the Nasdaq.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts described the market as in a wait-and-see mode ahead of major news events this week, including a US presidential debate and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 39,411.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.3 percent to 5,447, while the Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 17,496.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's some natural rotation just given how massive the outperformance between the big tech stocks and the artificial intelligence momentum plays has been relative to the broader market," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's just a kind of a natural consolidation and rotation trade taking place there."
  <br/>

  Ahead of the Thursday night debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump and Friday's report on personal consumption pricing, the calendar includes earnings from FedEx and consumer confidence data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AI star Nvidia, which has risen spectacularly over the last year to attain a market capitalisation above US$3 trillion, fell 6.7 percent in the stock's third straight down day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other big AI-linked equities including Qualcomm, Broadcom and Arm Holdings also fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Target rose 2.4 percent after announcing a partnership with global commerce platform Shopify intended to boost Target Plus, the big box store's digital marketplace. Shopify fell 1.1 percent. (AFP)

    EU accuses Apple of breaking bloc's new digital rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Under the new Digital Markets Act, the European Commission has the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758864_1_20240625015852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple risks billions of euros in fines after the European Union on Monday accused the iPhone maker of violating the bloc's landmark digital rules by hindering competition on its App Store.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The European Commission informed Apple in a "preliminary view" that the "App Store rules... prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finding opens a new front in the increasingly bitter fight between the US tech giant and Brussels over the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), and may force changes to the way the App Store operates in the bloc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Apple said it would delay rolling out recently announced AI features in Europe because of "regulatory uncertainties" linked to the DMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sweeping law seeks to rein in the world's biggest tech firms, including Apple, by forcing them to open up to competition in the 27-country EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for Apple, the new rules are a significant challenge to its walled garden and it has openly accused the DMA of creating greater privacy and security risks for users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time the commission has levelled a formal accusation against a tech firm under the new rules, after opening the first DMA probes into Apple, Google and Meta in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple said on Monday that it has made "a number of changes" to comply with the rules in response to feedback from developers and the EU regulator over the past months, and would "continue to listen and engage with the European Commission."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple can now access the commission's investigation file and reply to the findings. If Apple falls in line with EU rules, it can avoid a fine and Brussels believes it will give European users easier access to cheaper offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the commission's view is confirmed, it would adopt a "non-compliance decision" by late March 2025 – opening the way to fines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new law, the commission has the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five per cent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion (358 billion euros).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU also has the right to break up companies, but only as a last resort. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rohit Sharma smashes another four on his way to a sensational 92. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758866_1_20240625031528.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rohit Sharma led from the front with a blistering 92 as India beat Australia by 24 runs in St Lucia on Monday to seal their place in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The India captain's dashing innings – he faced just 41 balls, including seven fours and eight sixes – was the cornerstone of a total of 205-5 made after he lost the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia eventually finished their reply on 181-7, with left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh taking 3-37.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India will now face defending champions England in Thursday's semi-final in Guyana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat meant Australia's fate was no longer in their own hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan, who produced a stunning upset in beating Australia by 21 runs last time out, will qualify for the semi-finals if they defeat Bangladesh later on Monday in the concluding Group One game of the Super Eights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia lost David Warner for just six when the veteran left-handed opener was undone by a full-length delivery from Arshdeep that he could only edge to Suryakumar Yadav at slip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travis Head, whose superb century crushed Indian dreams of a 50-over World Cup final win on home soil last year, kept Australia in the hunt with a well-made 76 off 43 balls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His second-wicket stand of 81 with skipper Mitchell Marsh looked to be turning the tide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Marsh was brilliantly caught one-handed on the boundary by a leaping Axar Patel off Kuldeep Yadav for 37.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep then bowled dangerman Glenn Maxwell for 20 with a superb 'wrong-un' on his way to fine figures of 2-24 in his maximum four overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And when Head holed out off a superbly-disguised slower ball from paceman Jasprit Bumrah, Australia were all but beaten at 150-5 in the 17th over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, India star batsman Virat Kohli holed out for a five-ball duck off Josh Hazlewood, with Tim David taking a fine running catch over his shoulder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fellow opener Rohit then cut loose. He was particularly severe on Mitchell Starc, the only change to the Australia team following their upset defeat by Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hit the left-arm fast bowler for 29 runs in a third over where he struck four sixes – two in successive balls over extra-cover, a monster hit over deep midwicket and a top-edged full toss over the wicketkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with Rohit threatening the first hundred of this tournament, Starc bowled him with an excellent yorker. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jordan Bardella is credited with helping the National Rally party to clean up its extremist image. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758863_1_20240625013313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French far-right leader Jordan Bardella said on Monday his party was ready to govern as he pledged to curb immigration and tackle cost-of-living issues ahead of the country's most divisive election in decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In three words: we are ready," the 28-year-old president of the National Rally (RN) told a press conference as he unveiled his party's programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron threw France into turmoil earlier this month by calling the snap election after his centrist party was trounced by the far-right National Rally (RN) in a European vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekend polls suggested the RN would win 35-36 percent in the first round on Sunday, ahead of a left-wing alliance on 27-29.5 percent and Macron's centrists in third on 19.5-22 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella, credited with helping the RN clean up its extremist image, has urged voters to give the eurosceptic party an outright majority to allow it to implement its anti-immigration, law-and-order programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seven long years of Macronism has weakened the country," he said, vowing to boost purchasing power, "restore order" and change the law to make it easier to deport foreigners convicted of crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He reiterated plans to tighten borders and make it harder for foreigners born on French soil to gain citizenship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been 30 years the French have not been listened to on this subject," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella added that the RN would focus on "realistic" measures to curb inflation, primarily by cutting energy taxes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also promised a disciplinary "big bang" in schools, including a ban on mobile phones and trialling the introduction of school uniforms, a proposal previously put forward by Macron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign policy, Bardella said the RN opposed sending French troops into Ukraine – as mooted by Macron – but would continue to provide logistical and material support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his party, which had close ties to Russia before its war in Ukraine, would be "extremely vigilant" in the face of Moscow's attempts to interfere in French affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election is shaping up as a showdown between the RN and the leftist New Popular Front, which is dominated by the hard-left France Unbowed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Popular Front has so far refused to say who would be its candidate for prime minister if it wins, with several key figures urging the polarising France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc Melenchon to step back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella claimed the RN, which mainstream parties have in the past united to block, was now the "patriotic and republican" choice faced with what he alleged was the anti-Semitism of Melenchon's party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France Unbowed, which vocally opposes Israel's war in Gaza and refused to label the October 7 Hamas attacks as "terrorism," strongly denies the charges of anti-Semitism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In calling an election in just three weeks Macron hoped to trip up his opponents and catch them unprepared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts have warned the move could backfire spectacularly if the deeply unpopular president is forced to share power with a prime minister from an opposing party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marine Le Pen, the RN's figurehead who is bidding to succeed him as president, has called on him to step aside if he loses control of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has insisted he will not resign before the end of his second term in 2027 but has vowed to heed voters' concerns and change course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal cannot be to just continue as things were," Macron said in an open letter in French media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has urged the French not to make the election a referendum on his leadership, saying it is not "a vote of confidence in the president of the republic".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Macron's prime minister Gabriel Attal will go head-to-head with Bardella in a TV debate. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England spinner Shoaib Bashir made unwanted history on Monday when he conceded 38 runs in a single over in an English county championship match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Bashir, playing for Worcestershire, was put away for five straight sixes by England teammate Dan Lawrence, playing for Surrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sixth ball of Bashir’s over was sent so far down the leg side that it went for five wides, and there was worse to follow for Bashir when he overstepped with his next delivery, giving away a no-ball – and therefore two runs – along with a single for Lawrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Lawrence off strike, Bashir actually managed a dot ball with his last delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It tied the most expensive over in County Championship history. Alex Tudor also conceded 38 runs for Surrey against Lancashire in 1998, with former England allrounder Andrew Flintoff hitting 34 of the runs on that occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was only the 12th first-class match for Bashir, who made his England test debut on the tour of India in February and March. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='President Cyril Ramaphosa faces the tricky task of announcing an "inclusive" cabinet in the coming days. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758857_1_20240625001659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's weakened African National Congress (ANC) denounced on Monday "outrageous demands" for cabinet positions by its coalition partners in documents leaked to the press amid negotiations to form a government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Cyril Ramaphosa, 71, who has been re-elected for a second full term, will lead what his ANC calls a government of national unity after losing its outright majority in the May 29 general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The historied ANC of the late Nelson Mandela has governed South Africa since the advent of democracy in 1994 but only scored 40 percent of the vote last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC "notes with concern that some parties have been making outlandish and outrageous demands for specific cabinet positions in the media," the party said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, local media have reported tensions in negotiations between the ANC and the largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which won 87 parliamentary seats compared to the ANC's 159.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa faces having to balance demands for key ministerial posts from his party and its new allies, as well as mediating diverging views to agree a common policy agenda on the economy and other pressing matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But almost a month after the vote, no official communication has been made on the number of portfolios that will go to the new parties in government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of state is expected to announce an "inclusive" cabinet in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national unity government has 10 parties in total, including the DA, the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and other smaller groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A document, apparently from the DA and showing its letterhead outlining a list of preferred cabinet positions, has circulated on social media, stirring debate among South Africans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is... reasonable and fair that the DA should have representation across all cabinet clusters. To speed matters along, we set out here our preferred portfolios," the document reads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list includes the energy, transport, justice, home affairs and foreign ministries, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Negotiating through leaking demands to the media is an act of bad faith and this practice will not help the cause of any party," the ANC said. (AFP)
