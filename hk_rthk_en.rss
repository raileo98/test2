<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday kept its base rate at 5.75 percent, after the US Federal Reserve ended a two-day meeting leaving its key rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the first interest rate cut could come as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said “inflation pressure in the US has somewhat abated lately, and the market expects that the easing cycle might begin soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it added that the pace of any easing remains uncertain, and said the interbank offered rate in Hong Kong might stay high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong made a triumphant return to Hong Kong on Thursday, days after winning the SAR's first gold of the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made a sensational comeback in the women's epee gold medal match, overcoming a deficit of 1-7 at one point to beat French rival Auriane Mallo-Breton 13-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she was moved by the show of support from the many fans who gathered for her arrival at Hong Kong airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong's home. It's so good to be home. And being in Paris, I love the French people, with my French friend in the finals. But they had a huge crowd supporting her, and coming back it feels like I have my crowd too,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she had missed her father and wanted to meet up with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about her future plans, she said she was still savouring her victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It still feels unreal. It still feels like I have to go train, but I don't have to today, so I think I'm going to try and let this sink in and then decide what's next.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong also paid tribute to SAR athletes of previous generations, saying they achieved remarkable results with far fewer resources, paving the way for the current crop to pursue their dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she plans to use some of her HK$6 million prize money to buy gifts for her team and coach, adding that she would like to set up a fund to help provide fencing equipment for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said her aim is not only to promote fencing, but also to inspire others to discover and pursue their own passions in athletics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) called for community support for breastfeeding mothers as World Breastfeeding Awareness Week began on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leung Wing-cheong, a consultant obstetrician at Kwong Wah Hospital, said the authority has introduced various initiatives to promote breastfeeding, including lactation consultant clinics to address the concerns of mothers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said additional support includes antenatal education programmes and a dedicated helpline to assist women with breastfeeding challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that an important step forward will be the establishment of a breast milk bank, which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of next year. The bank is expected to collect 1,000 litres of breast milk per year, benefiting up to 600 premature babies, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said that breast milk is the most natural food for babies, highlighting the long-term benefits of breastfeeding in reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems in babies, as well as promoting neurological development in infants. He added that it also helps recovery after pregnancy and reduces the risk of breast cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that successful breastfeeding is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will be ideal if they have enough support from their partner, husband, in-laws, parents etc. I think successful breastfeeding is indeed teamwork, not just the mother on her own," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday rejected accusations in a Forbes Magazine article that suggested that Hong Kong was being used as a hub by "rogue regimes" to conduct "illicit financial transactions and evade international sanctions."
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government hit out at the Forbes commentary, claiming it cited "false and unfounded narratives" from an anti-China group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the SAR is part of China and that UN Security Council sanctions had always been imposed in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without naming names, it said certain countries might impose unilateral sanctions against some places on the basis of their own considerations but that the SAR government did not have the legal authority to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said thanks to local law enforcement agencies, a number of suspected Hong Kong-registered companies had been struck off, and suspicious vessels had been denied entry into Hong Kong waters as part of its robust system to implement sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cedric Ho recalls having doubts about his career. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764124_2_20240731231321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencers Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho said they're aiming higher after making their Olympic debuts in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both hope to continue to shine in the sport thanks to the spirit of never giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan bowed out of the women’s foil individual event after she was beaten by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16. Still, it's the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old recalled enjoying every moment on the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I was just focusing on the skills or tactics, what I want to do and just try my very best to score. And even though I know at the very end the gap was quite big, I didn't give up. Actually in my mind, I just want to try all my stuff and I just want to do my best," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said fellow fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung’s triumphs motivated her and other young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was amazing because my competition day was in the middle. So like before my competition day I saw Vivian got the gold medal… They brought home two gold medals which is never easy, and I think a lot of citizens will know fencing this sport and I think more and more kids will be joining this sport as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a part-time fencer who’s studying in the United States, Chan said it was difficult to juggle between fencing and her studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she made it clear she didn’t want to give up the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho, meanwhile, recalled being at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The idea of giving up came up most when I was at my lowest point, which was about two or three years after the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. I was a bit down and confused and kind of wanted to give up, but luckily I got through in the end,” the 28-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho is the first male épéeist from the SAR to qualify for the Olympics in 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to Japan's Masaru Yamada in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This proves that we have worked very hard in the men's épée category for the past 12 years. The success of our men's épée is due to the whole team and the coaches working together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said he's proud of Ho’s performance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel that he has a lot of takeaways. He's seen his potential, his strengths, and he also has seen his room for improvement. And I hope that we can keep on growing together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu added he's confident that fencing will continue to develop in Hong Kong because of government support and infrastructure being put in place.

 The Hang Seng Index fell 16.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to open at 17,327.85 points on Thursday, following its 2 percent rise on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates could be cut as soon as September if the US economy follows its expected path, putting the central bank near the end of a more than two-year battle against inflation. The Fed ended its latest two-day policy meeting with a decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25-5.50 percent range that was set a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it was keeping its base rate at 5.75 percent.

         Hong Kong table tennis player Zhu Chengzhu bowed out of the women's singles, losing 0-4 in her round of 32 match against Japan's Miu Hirano.

         <br/>
         The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes. But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.

          Fan simply proved too strong for his Hong Kong, China opponent. He completed a 4-1 win in 36 minutes. Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet were the last shuttlers from Hong Kong to bow out of the Paris Olympics, as they shared an emotional moment following defeat in the mixed doubles quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The long-time partners on the court were brushed aside in straight games by the third-seeded pair of Chae Yu-jung and Seo Seung-jae.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans needed just 39 minutes to finish off the SAR duo, winning 21-15, 21-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang and Tse went down by as much as 9-16 in the opening game, before taking five of the next seven points to go within 14-18. They never got closer than that, however, and the Koreans hung on to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chae and Seo then asserted control of game two with an 8-1 run, and never relinquished the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Tang and Tse had trouble holding back tears while meeting the press afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse, who said she's grateful just to compete in Paris, revealed for the first time that she was in a hospital emergency ward two or three weeks ago but did not specify the reason.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Perhaps in the past month, I've cried every single day while on the court. Jordan withstood a lot from me," Tse said as she briefly lost her composure in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I couldn't even squeeze a toothpaste... or comb my hair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also heaped praise on Tang, saying without him she might have retired a long time ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, for his part, thanked Tse for not giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also picked up bumps and bruises here and there so I understand how difficult it is... Returning to a high level after injury is never easy, yet she's done it many times."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added they've been under immense pressure in the past year or so punching their Paris tickets, as they had trailed so much in the rankings.

 China's new swimming prodigy Pan Zhanle smashed his own world record as he destroyed the field to clinch a gold medal in men's 100m freestyle at the Olympics early on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pan, four days from his 20th birthday, finished the course in 46.40 seconds, 0.4 seconds faster than the mark he set in February in Doha at the World Aquatics Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Kyle Chalmers, more than a full second behind Pan, took silver, while Romanian David Popovici got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan's superb performance won Team China their 9th gold medal at the Paris Games and their first in the pool. It was also the first swimming world record of this year's Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could cut interest rates as soon as September, with technology shares leading the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Fed delivered what the markets anticipated in terms of opening the door to a rate cut in September without overcommitting," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major US indices spent almost the entire day in positive territory, hitting peaks during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference before edging down a bit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index led major indices, winning 2.6 percent to finish at 17,599.40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 percent to 40,842.79, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.6 percent to 5,522.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain interest rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Powell told a news conference that the first interest rate cut could come "as soon as" the Fed's next rate meeting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is beginning to feel more comfortable that inflation is beginning to come down," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Capital. "The Fed feels that it can finally get control of inflation, there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductor shares enjoyed a buoyant session, with artificial intelligence player Nvidia rocketing up 12.8 percent and Broadcom and Micron also advancing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing gained 2.1 percent despite reporting a bigger than expected loss as the troubled aviation company named Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO. The appointment won praise from analysts who said Ortberg's extensive aerospace experience would bolster a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft fell 1.1 percent despite reporting a 10 percent jump in quarterly profit to US$22 billion. Analysts said a crucial cloud computing unit did not grow as strongly as expected. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Donald Trump has accused his Democratic rival of happening to "turn black". Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764147_1_20240801033646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has questioned whether Democrat Kamala Harris is really black or is using race as a political convenience in an interview that sent shockwaves through the 2024 presidential contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black," Trump told a panel of interviewers at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And now she wants to be known as black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?" he said of Harris, who is the first black, female, and South-Asian-heritage vice president in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I respect either one but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn, and she became a black person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The provocative comments by the Republican presidential nominee were the latest in a stream of ratcheted up personal attacks by the 78-year-old on Harris, and follow his multiple remarks this week in which he accused Harris -- who is married to a Jewish-American -- of being anti-Semitic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden's White House swiftly responded to Trump's comments, calling them "insulting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the first black woman to hold the position, told reporters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey snagged another bronze medal on Thursday in the women’s 100 metres freestyle event in Paris, making her the first Hongkonger to clinch four Olympic medals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey stayed around the front of the pack throughout the first 50 metres, and was able to pull herself into second place behind the fast-starting American Torri Huske at the turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pushed through the last 50 metres and was in contention thoughout to grab a spot on the podium with a time of 52.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s world record holder Sarah Sjoestroem surged through to claim the gold with a time of 52.16 seconds, while Huske was 0.13 seconds back to pip Haughey for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters that she knew it would be a highly competitive race, so she just wanted to focus on enjoying the whole process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that my training for this race in the past few years was more intense compared to the Tokyo Olympics. I practised a lot more in terms of training time, number of minutes, and distance. Especially as you get older, your body recovery is getting worse," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children watching TV, everyone needs to add oil (keep going). The whole journey may not be easy, but if you have a dream, just keep chasing it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey earlier won the bronze in the 200 metres freestyle event, as well as two silver medals at the Tokyo Olympics in the same respective events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sjoestroem, who set the world record back in 2017, had only committed to join the 100 metres at the last minute having previously indicated she'd focus on her favoured 50m free.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese gymnasts suffered another blow at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Thursday, after Japan's Oka Shinnosuke secured gold following a neck-and-neck battle in the men's individual all-round discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka and the Chinese pair of Xiao Ruoteng and Zhang Boheng were leading the pack after completing five of the six routines, with less than 0.37 points separating the trio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang went last on the last routine - the horizontal bar - and needed 14.9 points to seal victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But minor flaws in his performance meant he ended up 0.2 points short, handing victory to Oka who reigned supreme with a final score of 86.832. Xiao rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan have now won the event four consecutive times, but their defence did not come easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang stumbled out of the gate in the floor exercise, with his score of 13.233 points being one of the worst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he recovered since, even rising to medal contention with a strong 15.3 points on the parallel bars in the fifth round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang and Xiao were part of the Chinese group who coughed up the gold medal in the team event on Monday. Their teammate Su Weide fell twice from the bar in the final routine, enabling a dramatic comeback by Japan to snatch gold from China's hands.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Futures traders believe there's a 60 percent probability that the US Federal Reserve will make cuts of at least 0.75 percentage points this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve left its key lending rate unchanged again on Wednesday and said it had made "some further progress" in its inflation fight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the US central bank's benchmark interest rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement -- keeping rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a small uptick in inflation earlier this year, recent data suggest the Fed's mission of bringing inflation back down to its long-term target of 2 percent is now firmly back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its favoured measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labour market has come into better balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective," the Fed said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks a slight change in tone from its decision in June, when it noted only that "modest further progress" had been made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance," the Fed said, adding that it was "attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But since then, the official figures have painted a better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 60 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cuts are expected to come in the form of three separate quarter-point moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favouritism towards the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen on Wednesday became only the second Chinese tennis player to reach the singles semi-finals at an Olympics, beating German veteran Angelique Kerber 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(6) in the quarter-finals in a three-set thriller.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two tough sets, Kerber, who won a silver medal at Rio 2016, took the lead in the third to 4-1 and received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic French crowd after saving a huge break point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having run out of steam on a hot and humid Philippe Chatrier court and lost 10 points in a row, she bounced back to 4-4. But Zheng's powerful shots allowed her to win the tiebreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the quarter-finals, at a tournament the 36-year-old had said would be her last, was the former world number one's best performance this year after returning from maternity leave in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German had lost in the first round of this year's three Grand Slams so far, the Australian and French Open followed by Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng reached a career-high ranking of No. 7 after her runner-up finish at the Australian Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men's side, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz shrugged off crushing humidityto stay on course for an Olympic gold medal showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, seeking a first Olympic title at Roland Garros to add to his record-breaking collection, defeated German left-hander Dominik Koepfer 7-5, 6-3, becoming the first man to reach four singles quarter-finals at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu concluded his maiden Olympic campaign on Wednesday after losing to old rival Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei in their group stage finale.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was sent packing after 12th-seeded Chou wrapped up a 21-18, 21-13 victory in 44 minutes to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 17 Lee, who was beaten by Chou in eight of their 12 previous matchups, mostly played catch-up in their latest encounter. The SAR shuttler came back from six points down in the opening game to make it 18-19, before his opponent delivered perfect smashes to take the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chou once again moved in front in the ensuing game with a 12-6 lead, and Lee failed to erase the deficit the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the press after the match, Lee said he felt he could have done better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather up and down emotionally... I give myself too much pressure, I wanted to prove myself to others," he conceded, holding back tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before arriving [in Paris], I told my coaches, this is my only chance to prove to the world who Lee Cheuk-yiu is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to address his weaknesses and consistency issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the La Chapelle Arena in Paris, Chinese Taipei veteran Tai Tzu-ying suffered a shock group stage exit in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three, who bagged silver in Tokyo, was stunned by Ratchanok Intanon from Thailand in straight games, 19-21, 15-21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai, who was battling multiple injuries, burst into tears after the match and shared a warm embrace with her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did my best, based on my condition at this year's Games," a tearful Tai told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I can say that I have tried my best. But of course, speed-wise I was unable to catch up to my opponent."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Alex Cheng has notched his maiden race victory in the men's windsurfing competition off Marseille.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The win on his seventh attempt propelled Cheng to 11th overall among 24 entrants. He climbed another two places to ninth after coming back seventh, 10th and fifth respectively in the next three races on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five remaining races are scheduled for Thursday afternoon, local time. Only the top 10 boats in the 15-race opening series will advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng's SAR teammate, Mui Ma, dropped one place to 12th overall after another four races on Wednesday in the women's iQFOiL event. The 26-year-old started strong, finishing seventh on race eight, but her performance tapered off as the day progressed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In sailing, Hong Kong's Akira Sakai and Russell Alysworth remain last out of 20 teams following the penultimate race in the men's skiff category. Only the top 10 boats will enter the medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Nautical Stadium in Vaires-sur-Marne, east of Paris, SAR rower Chiu Hin-chun finished fifth in the six-strong semi-final of the singles skulls with a time of seven minutes, 3.68 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will wrap up his Olympic campaign on Thursday with a ranking race determining the 19th to 24th places.

    Boeing names new boss - unveils hefty loss

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing named former Rockwell Collins chief Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO on Wednesday, as the planemaker reported a loss on continued operational problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ortberg, 64, helped lead Rockwell Collins and integrate it into United Technology prior to his retirement from RTX in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment comes as Boeing attempts to rebound from a series of safety and quality control problems that have sharpened scrutiny on the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg "is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry," said Boeing chairman Steve Mollenkopf in a message to employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg is set to become CEO on August 8, taking over for Dave Calhoun, a former General Electric and private equity executive who has held the post since early 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Kelly as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in our long history," Mollenkopf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing on Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of US$1.4 billion, compared with a loss of US$149 million in the year-ago period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenues fell 14.6 percent to US$16.9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterly results reflected a continued drag from Boeing's commercial division, where it has lowered production while addressing safety and quality control issues under the close watch of regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has been in the hot seat since a January incident in which a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest results also showed significant weakness in its defence business due to a number of fixed price contracts where it has experienced deep losses due to supply chain problems, as well as higher engineering costs and technical issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's press release listed four defence contracts behind an operating loss of US$913 million in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations," Calhoun said. "We are making important progress in our recovery and will continue to build trust through action and transparency." (AFP)

    Warnings before enforcement over illegal feeding

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said verbal warnings will be given before enforcement action for a month after an amendment to the city’s wildlife protection law takes effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Legislative Council passed the Wild Animals Protection (Amendment) Bill in May, raising the maximum penalty of feeding wild animals to HK$100,000 and a one-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be a fixed penalty of HK$5,000 for illegal feeding, and the ban will be extended to cover feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new law takes effect on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Wednesday that officers will issue verbal warnings before taking enforcement actions when they find any illegal feeding activity from August 1 to 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Starting from September 1, enforcement officers will take enforcement action immediately without prior verbal warning if any person is found to be illegally feeding feral pigeons or wild animals,” it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the police and AFCD officers, appointed officers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and Housing Department can also take enforcement action against illegal feeding, the AFCD noted.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Concern for Grassroots' Livelihood Alliance says workers are at risk of falling unwell when working outdoors in the summer. Photo courtesy of the Concern for Grassroots' Livelihood Alliance" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764102_1_20240731195342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group on Wednesday urged the Labour Department to beef up its guidelines on working under hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department issued the "Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work” more than a year ago, outlining the criteria for outdoor workers to take hourly breaks during extreme conditions to prevent heatstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An updated version was issued earlier this year, aligning the department’s warning system to the Hong Kong Observatory's "extremely hot special weather tips".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the document also states that employers or contractors could abolish breaks for workers if certain measures are implemented to prevent heatstroke, such as providing drinking water, cooling vests and portable fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Concern for Grassroots' Livelihood Alliance said 90 percent of 100 cleaners responding to their recent survey said they felt unwell even when preventive measures were in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to social worker Au Yee-wing from the alliance, many cleaners said the guidelines failed to address their needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said, for example, that employees working in extreme hot weather wearing protective suits are granted extra rest time, but those wearing only masks are not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Street cleaners wear masks while working in the hot environment. We suggest the Labour Department review the guidelines, allowing cleaners to increase their rest time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au added that cleaners often have heavy workloads, making it even more difficult for them to take breaks.

 Hong Kong’s Jason Ng did not finish the triathlon race which took place under the blazing Paris heat, ending his maiden Olympic journey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng completed the 1,500-metre swim in 24 minutes and 6 seconds, with a transition time of 51 seconds before starting the 40-kilometre bike ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not finish the course and was eliminated before putting on his running shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Ng said his performance suit's zipper was pulled off during the triathlon competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the midst of the competition, my trisuit was grabbed by someone and the zipper in the back was pulled off," Ng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water kept going into my suit, and it became like a parachute. The entire suit kept pulling me backwards, and it didn't help with the water resistance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Alex Yee pipped New Zealand's Hayden Wilde for an amazing victory in the event. The Tokyo silver medallist showed his pacing mastery of the 10-km run, passing a flagging Wilde with less than 400 metres to go in blazing sunshine and 30 degree Celsius heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been postponed for a day due to the poor water quality of the Seine River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel, a Mexican living in Paris who watched the race along Avenue des Champs-Élysées, said it was worth the wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m assuming that the people were testing the levels of bacteria. I had heard all of the things they needed to do properly so I’m glad that they did wait and it was well worth the wait. Honestly it was a great race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kristen, a spectator from New Jersey, said she enjoyed watching the race but not the idea of swimming in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I'm glad that the sun was better for them today. I still think it's gross that they had to swim in that [river],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, France's Cassandre Beaugrand won a historic gold in a thrilling women's individual triathlon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland's Julie Derron dug deep to win silver, while Great Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wong Chun-ting of Hong Kong put up a good fight in his round-of-32 men's table tennis singles match at the Paris Olympics, but he was no match for second-seeded Fan Zhendong of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan was off to a fast start, racing to a 2-0 lead by taking the first two games 11-5, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong came to life in the third game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He jumped out to leads of 4-0 and 5-1 before holding on for an 11-9 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fan simply proved too strong for his SAR opponent. He went on to capture the next two games 11-6, 11-3 to complete a 4-1 win in 36 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Olympics this year is special. For one, I am already 33 years old, so I am considering this Olympics to be my last. Because for the next one, four years later, whether or not I can get the chance to compete is unknown, too much uncertainty," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Zhu Chengzhu on Wednesday bowed out of the women's singles event at the Paris Olympics, losing 0-4 in her round of 32 match against Japan's Miu Hirano.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy this time, and I enjoyed every game," she said after the match. "I think it’s normal whether I win or lose – there will be a women’s team battle next, so I will prepare well for every game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anything is possible because of this venue. Although I was not feeling as confident today, if I am confident, anything is possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Zhu is next set to compete in the women's team round of 16 next Tuesday, when the Hong Kong, China team take on Sweden at South Paris Arena 4.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official advance estimates released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compares with a revised 2.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed the second quarter growth to an increase in exports and investment spending, saying it expects the economy to continue to expand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year, but performance of the different economic segments may vary amid uncertainties on various fronts," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions, escalating trade conflicts, and US interest rate trajectory remaining not entirely clear may add uncertainties to economic sentiment and activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Natixis Asia Pacific economist Gary Ng said the figure for the second quarter was slightly higher than he expected, but pressures still remain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the other components, such as the contraction in the household spending and also the greater growth in the import of services, which is basically reflecting the outbound tourism and also the rebound in investment, which basically just get back to the pre-Covid level and is still 16 percent lower than 2018 for the same period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think these are all the sorts of pressures that I would see within the economy that can actually drag the growth rate further in the future."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific and HK Express passengers can now use their mobiles to check in baggage at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using the airlines' apps, passengers can get a printed tag at special channels and drop off their luggage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The function is only available to people with electronic travel documents who are flying to places where they don't require a visa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris Au Young, the general manager of data analytics at the Airport Authority, said the new bag drop service will save passengers time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So if we compare that method with the old method, the old method takes two minutes more. If we don't count any time used for lining up, the entire process is shortened from three minutes to only one," he told the media on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au Young said the authority hopes to expand the function so it can be used by 80 percent of passengers leaving Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings on Wednesday said its first-half pre-tax profit came in at US$21.6 billion, a 0.5 percent decline compared to the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it will pay an interim dividend of 10 US cents per share, the second payment this year following the 31 US cents announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC also announced a further three-month repurchase of up to US$3 billion, following the completed US$3 billion buyback announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With several major central banks seen likely to cut interest rates later this year, the group's outgoing chief executive, Noel Quinn, told an online press call that HSBC has reduced its sensitivity to interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we knew that interest rate declines were going to come at some stage, we've been investing heavily in building up alternative revenue growth options, mainly around wealth, international wholesale banking and international transaction banking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incumbent chief financial officer, Georges Elhedery, will step into the chief executive role in September following Quinn's retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery highlighted the bank's commitment to its core Hong Kong and UK markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bulk of our capital and resources are deployed in our four scale activities, that is Hong Kong, the UK, our international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities, and our wealth proposition, and that's in particular in Asia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm intending to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, intending to continue improving operating leverage, while maintaining a very strong discipline which is now embedded in the firm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has named Jonathan Bingham as the interim group chief financial officer, effective from September 2.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764040_1_20240731141947.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong University's Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it has developed a medical-grade smartphone stethoscope for early detection of valvular heart disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The faculty said the AI-powered software Vitogram has an estimated accuracy of 81 percent for detecting significant valvular disease, a level comparable to a doctor's assessment using a traditional stethoscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it does not replace the function of a doctor, you still need a doctor to perform comprehensive assessment on a patient for proper diagnosis, but our invention provides a very powerful disease screening tool," said Associate Professor Joshua Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitogram uses AI to measure heart sounds from four parts of the chest, with each measurement taking approximately 10 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho described the tool as an "AI doctor in your pocket" that allows anyone to conveniently assess their own health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university's Dr. Wong Chun-Ka said Vitogram is among the first software able to record and analyse heart sounds, as opposed to just a person's heart rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are able to detect structural diseases like valve disease, which is not possible using previous commercially available devices," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university is hoping that Vitogram will be available on the market in the next six months to a year and is looking to partner with healthcare organisations in places including Singapore and Malaysia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said Hong Kong will sign 13 agreements with Cambodia to boost trade and investment between the two places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Deputy Prime Minister Sar Sokha, Lee said Hong Kong will enhance collaboration with Cambodia across various sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Cambodia and Hong Kong will be closer than ever before. I'm confident we will work to further strengthen cooperation between the two governments, promote commerce, tourism, and cultural exchanges, strengthen people-to-people ties and jointly contribute to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said that the Trade Development Council will set up an office in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to promote business ties between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that he and Cambodian officials have discussed easing visa and travel rules to promote tourism in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Cambodia for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

    New taxi fleets to hit the streets within a year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The firms have a year to complete their preparations and will operate a total of 3,500 cabs. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764032_1_20240731131941.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five new taxi fleets are expected to hit the streets within a year after beating several other applicants to win licences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities on Wednesday said they received 15 applications in total, but three did not meet the requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the chosen fleets, three will operate only urban taxis, while the other two will cover urban areas as well as the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms have a year to complete their preparations and will operate a total of 3,500 cabs, accounting for a fifth of the taxis in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said fleet operators will provide training for drivers and monitor their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said they have to offer a number of electronic payment methods as well as online car-hailing services with no cap on booking fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individual applicants may engage different partners for developing the online platform for them. There will be quite a room for development, taking into account their own market strategies and the clientele they are targeting. We do not stipulate the hard-and-fast rule on how the online services will have to be done," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For trips booked in advance, we will allow the flexibility for the taxi drivers to charge at a pre-agreed rate, or to charge according to the meter, plus an additional amount as the pre-booking fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers will be able to rate their taxi drivers with a complaint mechanism in place, the transport official said, adding that serious breaches could result in the termination of licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said car parks in Tsing Yi and Tai Po are in the pipeline for the taxis, and the authorities will look into whether to expand the scheme to grant more licences in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the fleet operators, Sino Development, said it will operate taxis across the city, including on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to make good use of our resources and operate all 1,000 taxis to provide quality services to citizens," said fleet operations manager Wong Tai-hoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For full-time cabbies, we will need 2,000 of them, on top of 1,000 part-time, substitute drivers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung from another operator, Big Boss Taxi Company, said the group already has a number of taxis in line with the requirement that vehicles in the fleets must not be more than three years old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Coming from the taxi industry, we already have on hand almost 200 taxis. They are ready to be deployed anytime. But we do want to have a more diverse fleet, which includes the premium taxis as well as the ones for wheelchairs," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Likely we will do a soft launch at the end of this year, maybe perhaps early next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fleet operator SynCab Service, for its part, said it will bring in over 120 new cabs before the end of the year, including six-seater, electric taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said reserving a journey in a six-seater is expected to cost 10 to 25 percent more than a taxi meter charge.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign business leaders on Wednesday said a new permit is providing easier access to the mainland, as the first batch of non-Chinese permanent residents in Hong Kong received their travel cards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Permit holders can travel to the mainland within the five-year validity period, with each stay not exceeding 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce, Dato' Gan Khai Choon, was among those collecting their permits at a China Travel Service centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we wanted to go to mainland China, in the early days, we had to apply for a visa like everybody else. But for Malaysians ourselves, we also needed to apply for permission from our Malaysian government to have a permit to go into China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When China and Malaysia had a better relationship, we could apply independently without the Malaysian approval. But even at that time, to apply for a visa, it was quite difficult because the process and passport requirements were quite cumbersome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the application process for the new permit was smooth with the application centre offering him a "first-class service", and that he's planning to travel to the mainland in the coming few weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former committee member of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, Alfred Buchner, received his permit after filing an application around three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hasn't travelled to the mainland for seven years, because he wanted to avoid the hassle of going through the visa application process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of suppliers which I see in China, where I have contact in China, so far only by email... With this travel permit, it's a big encouragement to visit China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buchner, who picked up his permit along with his family, said he would first travel to Shenzhen for a weekend trip.

    Olympic triathlon events to go ahead

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great joy that we received this news," Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. "Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five women representing 34 countries and regions will kick off the contest at 2pm Hong Kong time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Jason Ng will participate in the men's event, which begins at 4.45pm, immediately after the women's race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The results of the latest water analyses...have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place," Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris has spent US$1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, the Palestinian militant group and Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said in separate statements on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian’s swearing in ceremony on Tuesday. The Guards said the attack was under investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this morning, the residence of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was struck, resulting in his and one of his body guards' martyrdom. The cause is under investigation and will be announced soon," the Revolutionary Guards said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamist faction, Hamas, mourned the death of Haniyeh, who it said was killed in "a treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts on Iranian state television immediately began blaming Israel for the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israel had vowed to kill Haniyeh and other leaders of Hamas over the group’s October 7 attack on the country that killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel itself did not immediately comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel's war with Hamas since the October attack, more than 39,360 Palestinians have been killed and more than 90,900 wounded, according to health authorities in Gaza. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), Vincent Cheng, on Wednesday called on the government to provide more details about proposed new sports facilities, saying Hong Kong currently needs more venues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Cheng noted that proposals for new sports facilities, such as a fencing area and swimming pools, were put forward in the past two chief executive policy addresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't see the government earmarking any land or a firm timetable for when construction will be completed. It takes time to build such facilities and I hope the authorities will announce a timetable as soon as possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said new HKSI facilities will be completed by the end of the year, but they will not provide a significant increase in space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China Table Tennis Association coach Yeung Ping-chiu echoed Cheng's remarks, saying a lack of facilities poses a major challenge for various sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said its fighter jets "eliminated" Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in the area of Beirut on Tuesday, accusing him of being responsible for a rocket strike on the annexed Golan Heights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israeli air force fighter jets eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organisation's most senior military commander and the head of its strategic unit, Fuad Shukr, in the area of Beirut," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the commander responsible for the Majdal Shams massacre, in which 12 children were murdered after Hezbollah fired an Iranian Falaq-1 rocket directly at a soccer field in northern Israel on Saturday evening," military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a separate video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the right-hand man to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader and his advisor in planning and directing attacks and operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hagari said Shukr was a "senior terrorist who has the blood of Israelis and many others on his hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the Gaza war, Shukr directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets and UAVs, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said that in the 1990s the Hezbollah commander was "directly involved" in the abduction of the bodies of three Israeli soldiers -- Benyamin Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Sawaid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three were killed by Hezbollah while patrolling the security fence adjacent to Har Dov, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since then, he has planned and directed numerous terror attacks against innocent civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Israel wanted to end hostilities without any wider war with Hezbollah, its forces were ready for "any scenario," Hagari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah's ongoing aggression and brutal attacks are dragging the people of Lebanon and the entire Middle East into a wider escalation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we prefer to resolve hostilities without a wider war, the IDF (Israeli army) is fully prepared for any scenario." (AFP)

  Wong, 26, was the third judoka ever from Hong Kong to qualify for the Olympics, marking the return of a local judoka to the Games after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was eliminated in the women’s under 48kg competition by Austrian Katharina Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Wong believes her presence in the Olympics would show others that they too can make it to the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Younger [athletes] may think the Olympics are out of reach. But going to the Olympics this time can show them that it’s not. They can all do it,” she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete said her judo journey is far from over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics are a good experience. I see that I have obviously improved this year in terms of throwing techniques. I hope I can perform better in the next competition,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-time Olympian said she will stay in Paris to watch the matches of top judokas and visit wineries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said she will continue to sharpen her skills, and her next goal is the Asian Judo Open Hong Kong which starts in November.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq tumbled again while the Dow forged higher on Tuesday as investors continued to steer funds away from artificial intelligence equities toward other sectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing so-called "rotation" from tech giants to smaller and medium-sized company comes as some of the biggest tech companies are set to report quarterly results in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, noted that this buying trend may be almost over now that Microsoft, Nvidia and others have fallen significantly from their peaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent to 40,743.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.5 percent to 5,436, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.3 percent to 17,147.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft reported after the market closed on Tuesday, while Apple, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta will report over the next two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This rotation likely stops when we get the majority of these mega caps to report," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Procter & Gamble dropped 4.9 percent as it reported a seven percent fall in quarterly profits on flat sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowdstrike also plunged nearly 10 percent following reports Delta hired attorney David Boies to seek damages following an IT outage that threw the airline's operations into turmoil for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the deluge of corporate earnings, this week's calendar includes Wednesday's Fed decision, as well as monthly US employment data on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Siobhan Haughey is heading into the women’s 100m freestyle showdown as the favourite, after qualifying the fastest out of the 16 swimmers in the semi-finals at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey, who notched a silver in Tokyo, clocked 52.64 seconds, 0.08 seconds ahead of Australia’s Shayna Jack in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old SAR star was only fourth at the halfway mark, but moved past her rivals with a late charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Yang Junxuan also punched her final ticket alongside world recorder holder Sarah Sjoestroem, but Wu Qingfeng barely missed out on a spot after finishing ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the pool, China's Pan Zhanle also qualified fastest in the men's 100m freestyle semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world and Olympic record holder will go up against Australia's Kyle Chalmers, the 2016 champion who set a time of 47.58 seconds, 0.37 seconds slower than Yang.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States reclaimed the women's gymnastics team gold in dominant fashion on Tuesday, while Simone Biles took centre stage again with a captivating performance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biles, together with teammates Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Sunisa Lee, led wire-to-wire. They finished with a score of 171.296, 5.802 more than silver medallists Italy, while Brazil rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, winners at the 2008 Beijing Games, finished a disappointing sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a shocking withdrawal from the team event in Tokyo, Biles has cemented her status as the world's most decorated gymnast by clinching her fifth Olympic gold, and eighth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Americans already had gold in the bag when Biles brought the Bercy Arena crowd to their feet with a gravity-defying floor routine that featured two of her signature skills - a double back flip with a half twist and the "triple-double" of two back flips with three twists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-seven-year-old Biles is set to add more medals to her cabinet after qualifying to four individual events in Paris. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu made a winning start in his maiden Olympic appearance, beating Mexico's Luis Ramon Garrido in the group stage of the men's singles tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee, the world number 17 who missed out on a spot for the Tokyo Games in 2021, overpowered his opponent 21-5 in the first game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 66th-ranked Garrido, who was also making his Olympic debut in Paris, took the ensuing game 21-15 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair exchanged leads in a nail-biting finale, but Lee eventually came out on top after pulling away late on to win 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top men's shuttler from the SAR next faces Chou Tien-chien of Chinese Taipei Wednesday evening, Hong Kong time. The winner of that match will advance to the round of 16, as Chou had already beaten Garrido earlier in their group tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a different story for another local badminton player, Happy Lo, who ended her Olympic journey after losing her second straight group match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supanida Katethong of Thailand beat Lo 21-14, 21-9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China said it respects the decision of the referees in a controversy involving fencer Edgar Cheung's win over his Italian opponent in the individual foil final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The Olympic Games are the highest-level events in the world. As always, the SF&OC and athletes adhere to and firmly believe in the Olympic spirit, respecting all game results and referee decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian Fencing Federation earlier lodged a complaint against what it called “unacceptable refereeing decisions” in Cheung's 15-14 win over Fillippo Macchi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President of the federation, Paolo Azzi, said he was disappointed with the conclusion the match, adding that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been robbed of the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were two occasions where both fencers landed their touches, but the referees from Chinese Taipei and South Korea ruled that no point should be awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macchi wrote in his Instagram post that he didn’t want to blame the referees for his defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that for sure the refereeing could have been better. It's impossible to not call three touches but at the end of the day that's the nature of the competition," Nicola Lu, epee coach of SAR fencer Cedric Ho, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have external factors that we cannot control and we can only focus on doing our best and focusing on our own actions,” Lu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case also sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian netizens on the social media platforms of the two fencers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, felt it was unlikely that Cheung will be stripped of his gold due to Italy's appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don’t think it will affect [the result] because the referees were very careful. They made the judgement after watching video replays many times. Even when you ask [other] people to review the play, it will still be the same result," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that the referees must decide responsibly when it’s hard to tell who wins or loses, adding that it’s normal for people to have different interpretations.

 Chinese pair Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha captured the gold medal for the table tennis mixed doubles event at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, after defeating Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong of North Korea 4-2 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Chinese duo, who won the 2021 and 2023 World championships, beat their North Korean opponents 11-6, 7-11, 11-8, 11-5, 7-11 and 11-8 at the South Paris Arena 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, North Korea said they could learn from China after winning their first Olympic medal in eight years on Tuesday in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For China, it was their first Olympic gold medal in the table tennis mixed doubles, after the event made its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, where Japanese pair Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito won the gold in a Japan-China final on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal was won by South Korean paddlers Lim Jong-hoon and Shin Yu-bin who beat Wong Chun-ting and Doo Hoi-kem from Hong Kong, China 4-0 earlier in the day. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting fought hard in the bronze-medal match of the mixed doubles table tennis event at the Paris Olympics, but they weren’t able to make it to the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team on Tuesday lost 0-4 to South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon in a match lasting 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean pair were off to a quick start, winning the first game 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then raced to a 3-0 lead, taking the second and third games 11-7, 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong pushed hard to catch up in a nail-biting fourth game, but it eventually went to Shin and Lim, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although we missed the medal by a small margin, the fact that we got into the top four this time is already a big breakthrough," Doo said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because actually there were a lot of teams before whose ability were better or similar to ours. Including the semi-finals, we really did keep trying to become better. Even though the ending was not the best, we did try our best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the defeat, it's the best finish for Hong Kong in mixed doubles table tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's a bit of a pity, especially since we had a chance to get a medal both today and yesterday," Wong said. "Although we are not very satisfied with our performance today, we were already thinking hard and communicating with each other about any strategy we can have before the match."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Landslides in India triggered by pounding monsoon rains struck tea plantations and killed at least 108 people on Tuesday, with at least 250 others rescued from mud and debris, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The southern coastal state of Kerala has been battered by torrential downpours, with blocked roads into the disaster area in Wayanad district complicating relief efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "93 dead bodies have been found so far," Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters. "This is one of the worst natural calamities that our state has seen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 128 people had been hospitalised for treatment after their rescue, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wayanad is famed for the tea estates that crisscross its hilly countryside and which rely on a large pool of casual labourers for planting and harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several estates in the district were hit by two successive landslides before dawn when most of their inhabitants were asleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published by the National Disaster Response Force showed rescue crews trudging through mud to search for survivors and carry bodies on stretchers out of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homes were caked with brown sludge as the force of the landslide scattered cars, corrugated iron and other debris around the disaster site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army said it had deployed more than 200 soldiers to the area to assist state security forces and fire crews in search-and-rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kerala state excise minister M.B. Rajesh said more than 250 people had been rescued so far, The Hindu newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's office said families of victims would receive a compensation payment of US$2,400.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More rainfall and strong winds were forecast in Kerala on Tuesday, the state's disaster management agency said. (AFP)

    Gauff crashes out of Paris Olympics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gauff talks with an official during her match against Croatia's Donna Vekic. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763919_1_20240730203828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff was left in tears after getting into an extended argument with the chair umpire over a ruling during the reigning U.S. Open champion's 7-6 (7), 6-2 loss to Donna Vekic of Croatia in a Paris Olympics third-round singles match Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number two Gauff claimed she was "getting cheated" over a line call in the sixth game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She then walked over to talk to the official, and play was delayed for several minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball," Gauff said to Campistol. “It’s not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her first Olympic singles tournament – she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles – ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 32 degrees celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Ian Ho has been eliminated from the men’s 100m freestyle event on Tuesday at the Olympic Games, finishing 55th overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is competing for the second time at the Games, finished sixth in his heat with a time of 51.46 seconds, 2.62 seconds behind the heat 5 winner Lamar Taylor of the Bahamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's definitely a different experience, but it's a little more familiar, so I'm glad I can be here again,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. Swimming is a sport where you can focus on yourself and do the best race that you can, and that's what I've tried to do over the past couple of days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Alexy of the United States led all 79 swimmers with a time of 47.57 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only the 16 fastest from the heats qualify for the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will also compete in the men’s 50m freestyle in Paris.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have failed to advance in the women's doubles in badminton at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their final group match on Tuesday, the SAR duo lost to Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first game was a closely fought affair before the No 4 seed from China prevailed, 21-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second game was also close with the score tied several times early on, before Liu and Tan put on a late charge to come away 21-15 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did well because we didn't fear them for their ranking. Even when we were trailing by many points during the match, we absolutely didn't give up and we tried to fight point by point," Lianne Yeung said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair finished in third place in Group B with one win and two losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the group and Bulgaria came second, both advancing to the next round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports psychologist says the Olympic Games highlight how athletes need to work on their mental state if they want to perform well, and not just their physical fitness and sporting skill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Karen Lo, whose clients include SAR Olympic athletes, on Tuesday said athletes need the mental discipline to maintain composure and focus, even when things aren't going their way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to remain calm and focused when you're losing, and also even when you're leading by a couple of points because you want to continue to lead as well. These are skills that are not so related to your fitness level, or physique, or your strategy and tactics. This is more on the mental side of the game," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that athletes may face extra pressures, such as performance anxiety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Athletes are human beings, they struggle with their mental health just like anyone else in Hong Kong. However, their identity is an athlete, they might feel extremely nervous handling expectations from the local community, and also coaches, that might be unique from everyone else," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that athletes can make use of psychological workshops and sessions to identify the underlying reasons for any confidence issues.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun's hopes of capturing a medal at the Paris Olympics came to an end on Tuesday, after he finished last among six competitors in the first quarter-final of the men's rowing single sculls event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clocked in a time of seven minutes 13.7 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew I was competing against seeded players in the quarter-finals, so I tried to catch up with them in the first 500 metres," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it would be challenging, but I didn't want to give up. The process was difficult and I had only myself, from preparing for the match to drawing up a race plan."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will row again in the C and D semi-finals on Wednesday.

 A Chinese diplomat in Cambodia has hailed a visit by a Hong Kong delegation to the Southeast Asian country as a boost to bilateral cooperation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Wenbin, the Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, on Tuesday met Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived in the capital Phnom Penh as part of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Laos and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the meeting, Wang noted that he had earlier sent off another delegation led by former chief executive and vice-chairman of the nation's top political advisory body, CY Leung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With Lee and Leung visiting at the same time, this shows that Hong Kong attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperation with Cambodia and promoting China-Cambodia relations," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The chief executive's visit will certainly promote mutually beneficial cooperation between Cambodia and Hong Kong, and play a role in further boosting China-Cambodia relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE, for his part, stressed the importance of fostering ties between governments, and allowing companies to do business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of his departure to Cambodia from Laos, Lee congratulated and praised fencer Edgar Cheung and swimmer Siobhan Haughey for their outstanding performances at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said their performances showed the excellence of Hong Kong's athletes, while reiterating the government's commitment to sports development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese leaders signalled on Tuesday that the stimulus measures needed to reach this year's economic growth target will be directed at consumers, pointing to a "batch of incremental policy steps" to boost domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Politburo pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a "proactive" fiscal policy, and reiterated the need for a "prudent" monetary framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency reported "the meeting stressed that it is necessary to focus on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand, and the focus of economic policy should be more to benefit people's livelihood and promote consumption".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said policies should increase residents' income "through multiple channels" and enhance the "ability and willingness" of low- and middle-income groups to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said economic measures should improve elderly and childcare, and "weave a dense and solid social security net".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No specific steps were announced, but the leadership gave instructions for a "timely launch [of] a batch of incremental policy measures".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also warned that "adverse effects brought about by current changes in the external environment are increasing", while there are "many risks and hidden dangers in key areas".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have announced various measures in recent months to boost the economy. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cui Jianchun says none of the consuls-general he met in Hong Kong are against the city's national security laws. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763839_1_20240730131358.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Foreign Ministry's Office in Hong Kong said respect is key to developing sound relationships between the SAR and foreign governments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Commissioner Cui Jianchun on Tuesday said sanctions imposed by the West on the territory disrespect the city's authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to build a good, sound relationship, we have to respect each other. That means every country has to respect the Hong Kong SAR government. And whatever things happen, you cannot use your national law to become a long-arm jurisdiction to impose sanctions to other nations, to other individual companies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said none of the consuls-general he's met in Hong Kong were against the city having its national security laws, and that a majority of them supported the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commissioner also urged foreign governments to support Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said he hopes he could work with the SAR administration during his tenure on the accession bid, as the move would be conducive to the city's development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the recent visit to China by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, where he discussed the war with Russia with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and met Chief Executive John Lee in Hong Kong, the commissioner said the SAR government is sticking to international law and international norms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government, Hong Kong people love to support the peaceful dialogue, peaceful communication as quickly as possible... and to relieve, also to alleviate, to reduce the suffering of the people and to try to do good things for the international community," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui, a former ambassador, was appointed to the office in April this year, filling the post after his predecessor Liu Guangyuan was named a deputy director of the liaison office.
