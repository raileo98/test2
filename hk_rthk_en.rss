<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Olympic delegation isn’t the only team representing the SAR in Paris – the city’s rope skipping performance squad is also in the French capital to push for their sport to be included in future editions of the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rope skipping troupe is amping up the atmosphere at the Paris Games by performing at the Place de la Concorde, which has become the heart of urban sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time in history, various urban disciplines, such as 3x3 basketball, street and park skateboarding, BMX freestyle and breaking, have been grouped together at one site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though these sports have increasingly been adopted in the past two Games, there are those, like rope skipping, that still have not made their way to the Olympic stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's what the Hong Kong Rope Skipping Association, China, is hoping to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform at the open stage of Parc Urbain to promote urban culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tina Wong, the association's chairperson, said performing in Paris is an opportunity they could not pass up, even though the Games conflicted with the jump rope Asian Championships in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are here on the Olympic platform. We actually have the goal or you could say dream to have jump rope skipping to be included in the Olympics in 2032 in Australia because Australia is one the strongest countries in this sport. This is a more long-term goal. On a short-term basis, we are aiming for Asia,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually last year, the Olympic Council of Asia has already granted rope skipping the provisional membership, so meaning we are already included in Asia. This year, we are here. Next year, we are aiming to go to the Youth Asian Games and pave the way for the Asian Games and then the Olympics. We hope with more support, we can officially be on the Olympic stage soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four athletes from the SAR have made their way to Paris to perform, including 18-year-old Yuen Hiu-tung, who said that the atmosphere was unbelievable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s like a dream to come here because even though we paid to come here, it’s a very valuable experience for us because we don’t know when jump rope can get into [the] Olympics, so it is a good experience to promote jump rope, and also letting everyone know how is jump rope [works] and how everyone is enjoying this sport,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The honorary secretary general of Hong Kong's top sports body, Edgar Yang, on Sunday said the city should nurture all athletes with potential, rather than solely focusing on one or two elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to a TV programme, the senior member of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China said the SAR has huge potential for sports development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the system must be very sound, and this sound method starts from popularising and definitely not focusing on just one or two athletes - but rather on the overall system that can bring out potential. We must put in a great effort. Even for those who have not yet fully realised their potential, we must enable them to be inspired," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Paris Olympics nears its end, Yang said Hong Kong athletes are now world class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR athletes have secured two gold medals in fencing and two bronze medals in swimming.

    Australian government urged to ban gambling ads

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs. Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765725_1_20240811154222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of leading Australians has demanded the government impose a total ban on gambling ads in a country that racks up some of the biggest losses per person in the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gambling losses in Australia, with a population of just 27 million, are estimated at A$25 billion a year (US$16 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adverts enticing people to risk their cash are widespread on television, radio and billboards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs, too, drawing more to part with their money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Gambling advertising in Australia is out of control with one million gambling ads being aired on free-to-air television and radio in just one year," said a letter signed by more than 60 prominent Australians to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the letter released at the weekend included former political, union, sports and faith leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Albanese's Labor government and the conservative opposition to agree to outlaw all gambling advertising within three years, in line with the recommendations of a 2023 report into gambling harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many Australians are alarmed about the proliferation of gambling advertising on our screens and the mounting losses through gambling," said former prime minister John Howard, who was among the signatories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe gambling losses are responsible for enormous harm throughout the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Studies cited by the government put Australian gambling losses at A$25 billion a year, representing a global record per capita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even during a period of Covid-19 measures that closed many pubs, clubs and casinos in the 2020-2021 financial year, Australian state government statistics showed gambling losses exceeded A$24 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total ban on all gambling advertising is essential to stop gambling companies targeting our children," said Alliance for Gambling Reform chief executive Martin Thomas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any decision to simply cap advertising, or limit a blanket ban to only social media, would be a win for vested interests and leave Australians exposed to significant harm," Thomas said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the financial losses, the cost of inaction would be "mounting financial ruin, mental health problems, suicide, and the family violence that gambling can exacerbate", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Nine Entertainment newspapers have said the government is expected to announce proposed legislation within weeks, possibly opting for limits instead of a total advertising ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said last week his government had engaged with "stakeholders" and was committed to "minimising gambling harm" but declined to say whether an advertising ban was envisaged. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan was writing on his weekly blog. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765722_1_20240811124413.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that Hong Kong should integrate further with China's national development and contribute to modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan said that the Third Plenary Session held in Beijing last month passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform and Promoting Chinese-style Modernization," which outlines Hong Kong's strategic positioning in leveraging the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, enhances the city's status as an international hub, and supports Hong Kong's bid in gathering top international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an international financial centre, Chan said that Hong Kong should fulfil its role as an offshore RMB business hub, focusing on shipping centre development, smart shipping, and green shipping, to make Hong Kong a "cross-border supply chain management centre" that provides one-stop support for mainland enterprises in expanding their production capacity and supply chain layout overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said this will generate new trade service demands and attract greater opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the SAR government is also recruiting talent and has launched a series of initiatives like the Top Talent Pass Scheme that supports talent development, to attract more top international talent to the region.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong on Sunday kicked off her visit to Hangzhou with a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme - a mentorship scheme aimed at helping underprivileged Hong Kong teenagers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During the five-day trip, Kong, along with the delegation, will visit technology companies and athlete training centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of her departure, Kong said she wanted to give something back to Hong Kong, as she started her new job as an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as an athlete, I worked really hard to train and to make Hong Kong people proud, to win results and to unite everyone so that we can all enjoy sports. And now that I'm lucky enough to join the Jockey Club, I wish I could use my platform and use the power of sports to unite everyone and hopefully just make sure that we all love sports and be happier," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said dozens of underprivileged pupils were joining the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eighty-four pupils and five mentors will take part in the five-day tour. The itinerary is diverse, ranging from innovation and technology, history, culture, to sports. We expect that senior officials from the SAR will also join this tour," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong announced her retirement from full-time fencing last week, after she won the women's individual epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There were 39 events up for contention on Day 15 in Paris, the second last day of these Olympics, and China went on a gold rush, completing a clean sweep of all the golds on offer in diving, table tennis and artistic swimming. The national team also celebrated Olympic wins in weightlifting, rhythmic gymnastics and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That single day haul of six gold medals means China leads the table with 39 golds, ahead of the United States which has 38. Australia maintain third place in the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look back at what unfolded.

  <b>
   Gold sweep 1: diving dominance

   China completed an historic clean sweep of all eight Olympic diving gold medals after Cao Yuan won the men's 10m platform final on Day 15 in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cao became the first to retain his Olympic 10m crown since American Greg Louganis in Seoul 1988.

    Like the divers, the national table tennis squad also made history by completing a clean sweep of all golds on offer at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    China completed the feat after winning the women's team title, the sixth time the Chinese have collected the full set.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Chinese women withstood a brave Japanese challenge but eventually overpowered their opponents 3-0 to snatch gold, the fifth Olympic title out of five events.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China clinched a third boxing gold at the Paris Olympics, as Li Qian was crowned women's middleweight champion after winning the bout against Panama's Atheyna Bylon on a 4-1 split decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, who took silver in Tokyo, was adjudged as the better performer in two of the three rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old top seed has now collected Olympic medals of all colours, having also won bronze in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said after the bout that by winning gold, she had made amends for the "regret" in Tokyo, and a fitting response to both herself and the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's boxers have won three golds and two silvers in Paris, with all of them coming in women's events.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The star-studded US men's basketball team successfully clinched their fifth straight Olympic gold -- beating France 98-87 in a hotly-contested final at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Curry hit eight three pointers to lead the Americans with 24 points. Four of his triples came in the final three minutes of the game to silence a raucous home crowd at Bercy Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of the Tokyo Olympics final three years ago, French center Victor Wembanyama finished with 26 points and seven rebounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts were able to keep the game close for much of the first three quarters, trailing 66-72 entering the final frame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Wembanyama tip-in cut the deficit to three with less than three minutes to go, but Curry then took control with his hot-shooting to put the US back up by nine with less than a minute remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After scoring his final basket, Curry, the four-time NBA champion, did his trademark “go to sleep” gesture where he puts his hands on the side of his face to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the 36-year-old sharp-shooter's first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Durant and Devin Booker scored 15 points apiece for the Americans, while LeBron James chipped in 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite a losing effort, French forward Guerschon Yabusele continued his strong play at the Games, finishing with 20 points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Running enthusiasts say they are thrilled to have a chance to follow the footsteps of their Olympic heroes in the heart of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For the first time, some 20,000 amateurs were able to run on the same route as marathon athletes on the penultimate day of the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The “Marathon For All” sets off at the French capital’s city hall and finishes at Esplanade des Invalides via Versaille, passing through landmarks such as the Louvre Museum and the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy came all the way from Hong Kong for a once in a lifetime experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because it's the Olympic Games. I think in a lifetime you cannot join. It shows that everyone can try to run on the same road, no matter if you are an elite runner or you are just a normal [person]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another participant, Michele from the United States, hoped she won't get too distracted by the city's night scenery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most difficult part is...I'm in Paris. This is my first time here. And I love it. And so I'm very distracted with everything else that's going on. So it's really hard for me to kind of just settle in, enjoy the moment, and just be here for the marathon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elizabeth, a hill runner from London, didn’t want to miss the opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just thought it was mad not to sign up. Honestly it's incredible. I was watching the men’s race, and I'm sort of joking that I'm going to come home an Olympian."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km route pays tribute to a key event of the French Revolution - the women’s march on Versailles in 1789.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's B-Boy Phil Wizard won the inaugural Olympic men's breakdancing gold in Paris on Saturday, beating home favourite Dany Dann of France in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, whose real name is Philip Kim, triumphed amid the opulent grandeur of the Place de la Concorde, with B-Boy Victor of the United States taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also known as breaking, the street dance is making its first and possibly last appearance at the Games, having been left off the programme for Los Angeles 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's competition saw 16 dancers - or B-Boys - going head-to-head in a series of battles, starting with a round robin before moving to a knock-out stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, a 27-year-old former world champion, had the crowd against him in the final against Dany Dann, a 36-year-old with blue hair whose real name is Danis Civil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Canadian soon had them eating out of his hand thanks to his incredible routine, for which the nine judges awarded him a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard explained the panel of judges were looking for "something new every round".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You may well think it's the most explosive, crazy dynamic movements that score the most points," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in breaking there's a lot of different categories and the most important thing is originality and diversity of movement."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Indian soldiers were killed in clashes in Kashmir, the military said early on Sunday, after security forces exchanged fire with militants in the disputed territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kashmir, particularly its southern Hindu-majority region Jammu, has seen a string of battles with insurgents in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army wrote on social media that two soldiers had "laid down their lives in the line of duty" in Anantnag district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army and police had clashed with militants after launching an operation in the area, according to a social media post by the local military unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinar Corps said on X that two civilians were also injured "due to indiscriminate, desperate and reckless firing by terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and each side claims it in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebel groups have waged an insurgency since 1989, demanding independence or merger with Pakistan, in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, soldiers and rebels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi and Islamabad accuse each other of stoking militancy and espionage to undermine each other, and the nuclear-armed rivals have fought multiple conflicts for control of the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, at least 11 Indian soldiers were killed in Kashmir following a spate of militant attacks. (AFP)

  The women's 4x400m gold also went to the Americans, as Shamier Little, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Gabrielle Thomas and Alexis Homes won in three minutes, 15.27 seconds, just a tenth of a second short of the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands took silver in 3 minutes 19.50 seconds, and Britain edged Ireland for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on, American sprinter Masai Russell won the women's 100m hurdles gold in another stunning photo finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finished the race in 12.33 seconds, a hundredth of a second ahead of France's Cyrena Samba-Mayela, who got her country's first track medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion, Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico, got bronze in 12.36 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Emmanuel Wanyonyi ran the third-fastest time in history to win men's 800m, clocking a personal best one minute and 41.19 seconds, just barely ahead of Canada's world champion Marco Arop, who got silver. Algeria's Djamel Sedjati had the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's Hamish Kerr became the first athlete from his country to win a high jump medal, taking gold after winning a jump-off with American Shelby McEwen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both men had cleared 2.36m, and decided they didn't want to share the top spot on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze went to Mutaz Barshim from Qatar, a joint-gold medallist at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In women's javelin, Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi sealed the gold medal with her opening throw, a season best effort of 65.80m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Faith Kipyegon broke her own Olympic record to win gold in women's 1,500m, finishing the race in 3 minutes 51.29 seconds, more than two seconds faster than her previous mark. She also became the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic 1,500m golds with another superb display of middle distance running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen middle distance star won gold in men's 5,000m, finishing the race in 13 minutes and 13.66 seconds. (Agencies)

    China achieves artistic swimming double

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For the third time on Saturday, China secured a clean sweep of gold medals in a sport after Wang Qianyi and Wang Liuyi clinched the duet in artistic swimming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old twin siblings from Shenzhen performed last out of 17 nations at the Aquatics Centre, after finishing first in the technical routine on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came back only fourth in the free routine, but the combined score of 566.4783 points was still enough to be crowned champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain's Kate Shortman and Isabelle Thorpe won silver at nearly eight points adrift, while the Dutch twins of Bregje and Noortje de Brouwer rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result marked a perfect ending for China, who already struck gold in the team event on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national artistic swimming team were runners-up in both events in the past two Games, losing to Russia on all four occasions. But the defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the country's conflict with Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the Wang sisters will return to school next month, having already been admitted to the Education University of Hong Kong's Doctor of Education (Chinese prospective) programme.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jonny Evans gave City the chance to win it when he skied his spot kick. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765683_1_20240811024639.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City avenged their FA Cup final defeat to Manchester United to lift the Community Shield 7-6 on penalties on Saturday, after a 1-1 draw at Wembley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The game exploded into life in the final 10 minutes as Alejandro Garnacho gave United the lead before Bernardo Silva levelled in the 89th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's men then edged a marathon shoot-out as Jadon Sancho and Jonny Evans failed to score for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have won the Premier League for a record four consecutive seasons but it is the first time in that run that they have won the season opener after defeats to Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The English champions were severely hampered by the absence of a series of key players due to their late return to pre-season after competing at Euro 2024 and the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's England trio of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Phil Foden, as well as Spain midfielder Rodri are yet to return to training following their efforts in reaching the final of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, United boss Erik ten Hag showed his desperation to win more silverware by thrusting teenager Kobbie Mainoo straight back into the heart of the action after his starring role for England in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite also leaving Kevin De Bruyne and Silva on the bench, City controlled the game early on with the electric Jeremy Doku causing havoc down the left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James McAtee could be handed his chance to shine this season by Pep Guardiola with Julian Alvarez set to join Atletico Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And McAtee, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield United, was inches away from making his mark with a curling effort that came back off the post midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's job is widely believed to have been saved by beating City back in May and he will feel his side should have got the better of their rivals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United were being starved of possession but still managed to create the better of the chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo should have gone for goal himself rather than trying to square to Bruno Fernandes with the goal gaping as half-time approached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes started in an unfamiliar centre-forward role due to the absence of Rasmus Hojlund through injury and a lack of match fitness for Joshua Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United captain thought he had opened the scoring with a stunning strike on the hour mark that was ruled out for offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho was introduced for the final half-hour and brought more pace and invention to the United attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentine teed up Marcus Rashford, who could only hit the post with just Ederson to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho thought he had won the game on 82 minutes as he jinked inside the City defence and fired low into the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, City rallied and levelled in the final minute of the 90 when Oscar Bobb's cross was headed in by Silva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Portuguese midfielder was then the first to miss in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Andre Onana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, though, experienced more penalty woe at Wembley after missing in the final of Euro 2020 for England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Ederson, who then fired in himself to keep City alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evans gave City the chance to win it when he blazed over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it was a tale of redemption for Manuel Akanji, whose saved penalty cost Switzerland in their Euros quarter-final against England, as the centre-back stroked home the winner. (AFP)

    US inflation still 'uncomfortably' high: Fed official

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765680_1_20240811011554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation remains "uncomfortably" above the Federal Reserve's target despite the progress it has made in recent months, a senior bank official said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank has held interest rates at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent following a pandemic-era surge in prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed's favoured inflation gauge now sits at an annual rate of just 2.5 percent – well below the peak reached in 2022 – while the US economy is still growing and the labour market has weakened somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, Fed chair Jerome Powell suggested in late July that the bank could move ahead with its first interest rate cut as soon as September – if economic data continues to come in as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some Fed officials have been more cautious about signalling rate cuts than others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The progress in lowering inflation during May and June is a welcome development," Fed governor Michelle Bowman told a conference in Colorado Springs, according to prepared remarks. "But inflation is still uncomfortably above the committee's two percent goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite "upside risks," Bowman said she still expects inflation to ease in the coming months, but warned policymakers to remain patient "and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to a single data point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The remarks from Bowman, who is a permanent voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, suggest she remains concerned about cutting interest rates too soon – despite overwhelming support for a September rate cut in the financial markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures traders are now wholly convinced that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September, and are instead split over how big its first cut will be, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US women's football team won its fifth Olympic gold medal by beating Brazil 1-0 on Mallory Swanson’s early second-half goal in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Americans, who hadn't won gold since the 2012 London Olympics, closed out an undefeated run to the title in their first international campaign under new coach Emma Hayes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher preserved the win with a one-handed save on Adriana’s header in stoppage time at Parc des Princes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss is more heartbreak for Brazil and its iconic star, Marta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six-time world player of the year has never won a Women’s World Cup or an Olympics. This is expected to be her last major international tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the third victory for the United States over Brazil in an Olympic final. The Americans also beat the Brazilians in the 2004 in Athens and four years later in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil has never finished better than runner up at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three years ago in Tokyo, the US settled for the bronze medal. (AP)

    New polls give Harris a lead over Trump in key states

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Voters polled in Pennsylvania said they saw Kamala Harris as more intelligent than Donald Trump and having a better temperament to govern. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765677_1_20240811002507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new polls published on Saturday, apparently eroding the advantage the former president has enjoyed there over the past year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Harris leading Trump by an identical 50 percent to 46 percent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the US electoral college voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The polls are a reversal of surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed Harris instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. The polling showed voters still prefer Trump on the key issues of the economy and immigration, though Harris had a 24-point advantage when voters were asked whom they trust on the issue of abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris's candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her announcement on Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energised Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans' successful national convention last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favourability – up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, his running mate JD Vance and other Republicans have tried an array of attacks meant to weaken Harris – with Trump even questioning her racial identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the new polls show Democrats strongly supporting the younger and more vigorous Harris who, with Walz, has been campaigning at a furious pace this week in swing states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among Democrats, voter satisfaction with their choice of candidates has shot up by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May, the polls found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three months ago, it was Republicans who expressed a higher level of satisfaction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surveys were conducted between August 5 and 9, with at least 600 voters in each state. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's team completed the country's clean-sweep of table tennis gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after defeating Japan 3-0 in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha, Chen Meng and Wang Manyu outclassed a fighting Japanese team of Hina Hayata, Miwa Harimoto and Miu Hirano for China's fifth gold in the sport, after the nation had earlier won both the men's and women's singles, the men's team as well as mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first match of the women's team final, Chen and Wang teamed up in the doubles against Hayata and Harimoto. The Chinese pair came back from two one-game deficits to force a deciding fifth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan raced to a 9-5 lead in the pivotal game, before Chen and Wang went on a 7-1 spurt to win 12-10 and take the first match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hirano then took on Sun in the second match, as she raced to a 7-1 start to open the matchup. However, the world number one Chinese player came roaring back to win the first game 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun then took the next two games, 11-6, 11-6, for a 2-0 lead overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall, Japan's Harimoto put up a fight in the third match by taking the first game against Wang, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese player stormed back to win the next three games, 12-10, 11-7, 11-6 to bring home the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the game, all three Chinese players said Japan proved to be difficult opponents, noting the Japanese were able to lead twice in the opening doubles match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said for her, it was important to come from behind and take the first singles game, adding it was a total team effort for the country to take home all Olympic table tennis golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy for us to take home all five gold medals. I very much thank our motherland, our team, there are many supportive forces behind us," she told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually today, it wasn't just the three of us competing, the whole Chinese table tennis team were behind us, giving us support."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the introduction of the women's team category in 2008, China has won all five of the event's gold medals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the UK on Saturday to protest recent rioting blamed on the far-right in the wake of the Southport knife attack that killed three children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Crowds massed in London, Glasgow, Belfast, Manchester and numerous other English towns and cities, as fears of violent confrontations with anti-immigration agitators failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It followed a similar situation unfolding on Wednesday night, when anticipated far-right rallies up and down the country were instead replaced by gatherings organised by the Stand Up To Racism advocacy group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen places across England as well as Belfast had been hit by unrest prior to that, following the July 29 stabbing spree, which was wrongly linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration, as well as police, vehicles and other sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, recent nights have been largely peaceful in English towns and cities, prompting hope among authorities that the more than 700 arrests and numerous people already being jailed has deterred further violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in Northern Ireland, which has seen sustained disorder since last weekend, police said they were investigating a suspected racially motivated hate crime overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A petrol bomb was thrown at a mosque in Newtownards, east of Belfast, in the early hours of Saturday, with graffiti sprayed on the front door and walls of the building, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the petrol bomb thrown at the property did not ignite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is being treated as a racially motivated hate crime, and I want to send a strong message to those who carried this out, that this type of activity will not be tolerated and any reports of hate crime are taken very seriously," PSNI Chief Inspector Keith Hutchinson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also overnight reports of damage to property and vehicles in Belfast, as nightly unrest there rumbled on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbances in Northern Ireland were sparked by events in England but have also been fuelled by pro-UK loyalist paramilitaries with their own agenda, according to the PSNI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 5,000 anti-racism demonstrators rallied in Belfast on Saturday without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, hundreds massed outside the office of Brexit architect Nigel Farage's Reform UK party before marching to parliament, as a large police presence looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage and other far-right figures have been blamed for helping to fuel the riots through anti-immigrant rhetoric and conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really important for people of colour in this country, for immigrants in this country, to see us out here as white British people saying 'no, we don't stand for this'," said attendee Phoebe Sewell, 32, from London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow Londoner Jeremy Snelling, 64, said he had turned out because "I don't like the right-wing claiming the streets in my name."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not hold Farage "personally responsible" for the violence but argued that the Reform party founder had "contributed" to the volatile environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he is damaging and I think he's dangerous," Snelling added. (AFP)

    Mission accomplished: China sweeps all diving golds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed an historic clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after Cao Yuan retained his 10m platform title to make it eight wins out of eight for the powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As much as the nation has dominated the sport in recent years, it has never taken home every gold medal at a single Games. It came close twice in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, with seven wins
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the once-elusive achievement did not come easy. Cao was locked in a tight battle against Japan's Rikuto Tamai, with the pair separated by less than three points after four rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that all changed in the penultimate round, when Tamai committed a serious error on his routine and dropped out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao finished with 547.50 points after six rounds, compared to 507.65 for the Japanese, which was good for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noah Williams of Great Britain propelled himself to a bronze with a sensational final dive worth 94.35 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Yang Hao, the reigning world champion who beat his compatriot Cao at the World Aquatics Championships in Doha in February, not only was a surprise omission from the podium, but finished last out of the 12 finalists.

    LA planning 'No Car' Olympics to beat gridlock

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said 2028 chiefs want the LA Olympics to be "The No Car Games" by investing in public transportation. File photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765668_1_20240810223516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles 2028 organisers said on Saturday they will force spectators to take public transportation to Olympic venues and encourage remote working in a bid to sidestep the gridlocked city's notorious traffic problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said 2028 chiefs want the LA Olympics to be "The No Car Games" by investing in public transportation and encouraging Angelenos to adopt pandemic-style remote-working for the duration of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'No Car Games' means that you will have to take public transportation to get to all of the venues," Bass told a press conference ahead of Sunday's Paris Olympics closing ceremony. "In order to do that we have been building out our transportation system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan would require borrowing more than 3,000 buses from other parts of the United States, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass was adamant however that Los Angeles's traffic, where rush hour congestion can lead to car journeys of just a few miles taking an hour or more, would not be a problem, citing the history of the 1984 Olympics in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 1984 Angelenos were terrified that we were going to have terrible, terrible traffic," she said. "And we were shocked that we didn't. And in 1984 we didn't have any of the technology that we do today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that city officials 40 years ago encouraged employers to stagger shifts or allowed workers to work remotely to great success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we can do that again," Bass said. "So part of having a no-car Olympics means getting people not to drive, but also using public transportation to get to the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We certainly learned from Covid that you have essential workers, people that must come to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if you limit it to that, it's going to be a lot easier because we did go through Covid. So people will have some reference point in recent history as to how you can do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass said the city would also aim to house Los Angeles's estimated 75,500 homeless population before the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if Los Angeles would follow Paris' example by moving several thousand homeless people in the build-up to the Olympics to locations outside the city, Bass replied: "We are going to get Angelenos housed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is what we have been doing and we're going to continue to do that. We will get people housed, we will get them off the street." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's rhythmic gymnasts won the group all-around final at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with Israel taking silver and Italy completing the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each team of five gymnasts had to produce their best performances with five hoops, as well as three ribbons and two balls. The scores were then added up to create a final total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the scoreboard with 36.950 points in the first routine with hoops and a medley of five musical compositions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team continued their strong performance with ribbons and balls to score 32.850, to a total of 69.800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China took home gold by a 0.950-point gap to beat Israel, who came in second with a cumulative of 68.850 points. Italy scored 68.100 to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bulgaria, who won gold at the Tokyo Games, narrowly missed out on a medal despite an impressive comeback from an initial mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team received the highest score in the second routine, recovering from an error in the first performance where two hoops clashed in the air.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese weightlifter Liu Huanhua on Saturday won the men's 120-kilogramme division in his debut at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He got to 186 kilogrammes in the snatch at the South Paris Arena, and lifted 220 kilogrammes in his first clean and jerk attempt before failing the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old completed four out of six lifts but it was enough for him to finish with a total score of 406, beating Uzbekistan's Akbar Djuraev by two kilos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djuraev also failed the final two attempts in the clean and jerk. Yauheni Tsikhantsou took home the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu previously set world records in both the clean and jerk at 232 kilogrammes, as well as the total of 413 kilogrammes in his weight class during the IWF World Cup in Phuket this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopian Tamirat Tola delivered a masterclass in solo front running to win the Olympic men's marathon in Paris on Saturday as Eliud Kipchoge's bid for a third gold went up in smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tola clocked an Olympic record of two hours  six minutes and 26 seconds for victory, finishing 21 seconds ahead of Belgium's Bashir Abdi, whose silver marked an upgrade from his bronze garnered at the Covid-hit Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Benson Kipruto, winner of Tokyo, Boston and Chicago marathons in recent years, rounded out the podium, a further 13 seconds adrift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you, Paris!" said Tola, the 2016 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist who will be 33 on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy today, I was 2022 world champion and now I'm Olympic champion. It's the greatest day in my life. This was my goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team fielded three long-distance runners in the event, with Wu Xiangdong finishing 40th with a time of two hours, 12 minutes and 34 seconds. Yang Shaohui came in 55th with a time of two hours, 14 minutes and 48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s third runner, He Jie, needed two hours 22 minutes and 31 seconds to finish the race, finishing 67th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km-long marathon course headed out of central Paris on a loop to Versailles.
  <br/>
  The route included a 436m climb and 438m descent. The maximum gradient on the route was 13.5 percent. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Gaza civil defence says 93 dead in Israeli strike

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Displaced Palestinians gather in the yard of a school hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza City. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765635_1_20240810170902.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced Palestinians killed 93 people, as Israel's military accused militants of using the building as a command centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas denounced the "dangerous escalation" in north Gaza, which came after international mediators invited the warring sides to resume next Thursday talks towards a long-sought ceasefire and hostage-release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry said the timing of the school strike "is an indication of the Israeli government's efforts to obstruct and thwart these efforts".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence in the Hamas-ruled territory said three Israeli missiles hit the school in Gaza City while people performed dawn prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their bodies were torn apart," civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. "It reminds us of the first days of the war in the Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced during the war started by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings, which have been hit at least 14 times since July 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army said on Saturday it had "precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the Al-Tabieen school".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has repeatedly made similar accusations after strikes on the school shelters. Hamas has previously denied Israeli claims that it uses schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities for military aims. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded more than 45,300 crimes during the first half of the year, a 5.6 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deception made up about 40 percent of all cases. Victims – who were mostly scammed online – were swindled out of HK$4.48 billion in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the number of "Guess Who" phone scams were down by 61 percent, the force pointed out that fraudsters had adopted new tactics such as impersonating staff of e-shopping and online payment platforms, and telecommunications companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force also revealed that its robbery detection rate of 84.1 percent was the highest since it started maintaining statistics for the period in 1977, with police stepping up anti-burglary patrols, especially in areas with village houses. Officers noted they used drones and partnered with the Government Flying Service to carry out air patrols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of June 30 this year, 300 arrests have been made under the National Security Law that was put in place four years ago, it added. About 60 percent of those arrested have been charged.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 1,000 policymakers, researchers and young entrepreneurs gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre on Saturday for the city's first youth development summit, organised by the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee said young people should learn from the Olympic spirit and be inspired by Hong Kong's young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we can't all be Olympic champions, we can all be champions of our own stories. We can all live in the spirit of the Olympic motto, faster, higher, stronger, together, in our pursuit," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong also attended the summit, where she showed her medal from the Paris Games to audience members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, who won gold in the women's individual epee, said she was initially very nervous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time I was nervous, I would turn and channel all that energy into training. So the more nervous I got, the more training I did, and that gave me the confidence to be like: okay, I am doing everything I can to fence the best that I can at the Olympics and I shouldn't be scared, I shouldn't be worried about the results", the 30-year-old fencer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said that the government's youth development blueprint could provide all-round support to its targeted beneficiaries of those aged between 12 and 39.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blueprint was rolled out in December 2022, with around 60 additional measures added last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them includes the Member Self-recommendation Scheme for youth. The government is working to triple the number of participating advisory committees to not less than 180 in the current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To date, 85 government advisory committees have joined the scheme, covering trade and industry, innovation and technology, human resources planning, child affairs, and much more," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that the energy, creativity, and resilience of young people will help create a better future.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="University of Hong Kong paediatrician Dr Mike Kwan said symptoms include a high fever and a red body rash. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765610_1_20240810113856.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong paediatrician on Saturday said the SAR has seen a large rise in scarlet fever cases this year, and he advised early treatment with antibiotics to prevent complications. The disease, which is caused by streptococcal infection, usually affects children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan, from the university's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said symptoms include high fever and a red body rash that leaves an in-print if touched. Speaking on a radio programme, he gave more details about the rise in case numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, for example last year, the notification rate in fact is less than 10 every month. But in Hong Kong this year, the notification rate, up until last month was around 260 in June. So the number is really high, and this indicated the streptococcal strep A activity is really high among our population," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lau Yu-lung, chairman of the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases, said there had been 4,500 Covid cases in Hong Kong last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the 31st week of this year - between July 28 and August 3 - sewage surveillance showed that infections seemed to have reached their peak. But it's too early to say whether there has been any decline," he said, while appearing on the same radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lau said there had been seven outbreaks in care homes last week involving 60 patients, and the situation is worrying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Covid jab could significantly lower the mortality rate, and he urged vulnerable people, such as those suffering from chronic illnesses, as well as people in care homes to get a booster.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Saturday said businesses should be more open to employing athletes once they retire, as they have already shown their abilities on a global stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Yeung said the government had allocated resources to help athletes once they step down. He said most have skills that are highly sought by employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually we hope the business sector will consider employing more athletes because we think they have a lot of abilities: such as how they face challenges, how they remain calm under pressure, and their perseverance. These are qualities we hope society will be able to see, and we hope the business sector will be able to give athletes more chances," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said universities here have been admitting athletes through their top athletes admission scheme and granting them a longer study period so they can attend training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the promotion of sport in the community is crucial if new talent is to be discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government is trying to promote different kinds of sport in the community.... When more people are involved in sport, more people will develop an interest in sport, and it will be easier for us to find talent and give them the resources to train their skills," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are also supporting the Hong Kong Sports Institute and The Jockey Club to do research into how to increase athletic performances and make use of human science to improve training," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the Paris Games had encouraged people to go out in the evening and watch Olympic events, which are free-to-air. He said the catering industry had recorded around a 30 percent increase in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked whether the government would continue to purchase the Olympic Games broadcasting rights in future, Yeung said the government would consider sporting events on a case-by-case basis.

    PBOC to increase buying and selling of treasury bonds

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's central bank, The People's Bank of China, said it would pay attention to changes in long-term bond yields. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765596_1_20240810084940.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's central bank will seek to "enrich" its monetary policy toolbox and will gradually increase buying and selling of treasury bonds in its open market operations, its second-quarter monetary policy implementation report said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will also seek to steadily lower companies' financing and household credit costs, the report said, adding that prudent monetary policy should be "flexible, moderate, precise and effective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC will "guide credit to grow reasonably and balance the supply of credit while keeping liquidity reasonably ample," said the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank will pay attention to changes in long-term bond yields during economic recovery and said it will conduct stress tests on the risk exposures of bond assets held by financial institutions and prevent interest rate risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's necessary to enrich the monetary policy toolbox, enrich and improve methods of monetary base injection, and gradually increase buying and selling of government bonds in the central bank's open market operations," the PBOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank will pay close attention to changes in the monetary policies of major overseas central banks, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economic growth missed forecasts in the second quarter, depressed by a property downturn and sluggish domestic demand, while some July economic indicators showed a mixed and unbalanced recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC will also study plans to appropriately narrow its interest rate corridor and deliver clearer signals of interest rates adjustments to markets. The central bank last month launched temporary repo or reverse repos to make open market operations more efficient and keep the banking system liquidity ample.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the Chinese yuan, the PBOC vowed it will prevent the formation and self-reinforcement of unilateral expectations and will guard against risk of exchange rate overshooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yuan is up 0.7 percent against the dollar this month, in tandem with a surging Japanese yen, as an unwinding of short positions snowballed following a surprise rate hike by the Bank of Japan and weakness in US economic indicators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To achieve a stable and sound development of the property sector, the PBOC said it will step up support to construction and seek to boost supplies of affordable housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keeping prices stable and ensuring moderate inflation will still be a significant consideration of the bank's monetary policy, the bank said, adding it will keep prices at a "reasonable level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's consumer prices rose at a slightly faster-than-expected rate in July, partly due to weather disruptions in food supplies, while producer deflation persisted, official data showed on Friday. (Reuters)

    Regional plane crashes in Brazil killing 61

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The plane crashed in the town of Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765594_1_20240810084017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A regional turboprop plane crashed near Sao Paulo in Brazil on Friday, killing all 61 people on board, the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Regional carrier Voepass said the plane, bound for Sao Paulo's international airport, took off from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed at around 1.30 pm in the town of Vinhedo, some 80 km northwest of Sao Paulo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video shared on social media showed the ATR-72 aircraft spinning out of control as it plunged down behind a cluster of trees near houses, followed by a large plume of black smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearby resident Daniel de Lima said he heard a loud noise before looking outside his condominium in Vinhedo when he saw the plane in a horizontal spiral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was rotating, but it wasn't moving forward," he told Reuters. "Soon after it fell out of the sky and exploded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City officials at Valinhos, near Vinhedo, said there were no survivors and only one home in the local condominium complex had been damaged while none of the residents were hurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I almost believe the pilot tried to avoid a nearby neighbourhood, which is densely populated," de Lima said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not immediately say what had caused the crash, though the head of Brazilian aviation accident investigation centre Cenipa said that the plane's so-called "black box" containing voice recordings and flight data had been recovered from the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video of the crash showed clear weather, with the forecast for the area calling for light rainfall and winds of 10 km per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may have been an engine failure on one side that was mismanaged by the crew," he said. "It could be the thrust of the remaining engine that started the rotation downward."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US aviation safety consultant and former commercial pilot John Cox said he would want to validate the Flightradar data, which showed a lot of gyrations in speed, but regardless, something "really significant" happened to cause the plane to spin when it came down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't spin airliners," Cox said. "So that says at some point it stalled and then the flight crew lost control of it. But it appears that there may have been some catastrophic event before that loss of control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cenipa head Marcelo Moreno cautioned in a press conference that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From what we can tell so far, the aircraft did not reach out to traffic control reporting an emergency," Moreno said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voepass, Brazil's fourth-largest airline by market share, said it could not provide any additional information on what caused the plane to crash. It had originally reported 62 people aboard the aircraft, though local media interviewed a man who said he had missed the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, the plane was carrying 57 passengers and four crew, Voepass said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Franco-Italian ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Leonardo, is the dominant producer of regional turboprop planes seating 40 to 70 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ATR told Reuters that its specialists were "fully engaged" with the investigation into the crash and its customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The motor on the plane was a PW 127 produced by Pratt & Whitney Canada, its parent company RTX Corp confirmed to Reuters. RTX said that it had offered assistance in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both French and Canadian investigators will participate in the investigation, Moreno said. Europe's safety regulator also said it would offer technical assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash is Brazil's deadliest since 199 people were killed in 2007 on a flight operated by TAM, which later joined LAN to become what is now LATAM Airlines. (Reuters)

    HK's pioneering Olympic judges pave the way forward

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The road to the Olympics is not easy for athletes, but it’s just as hard for judges who likely spend the same amount of time and effort in training to be able to officiate Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For gymnastics judge Yuen Ka-keung, the journey to Paris was lonely and arduous, but one that he hopes will pave the way for others to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Being an Olympic gymnastics judge is not easy because you have to pass many of the selection [tests] under the International Federation, so you had to prepare a lot, meaning that you had to spend a lot of the time and also you had to manage everything well,” Yuen, who is judging the Olympics for the third time in Paris, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to allocate my time and also allocate, for example, money to make the proper preparation for this Olympic Games. Another thing is that if you prepare for the Olympic Games very seriously, you will feel alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen is the only gymnastics judge from the SAR. To qualify, he had to judge designated events within the Olympics cycle and obtain the best evaluation result in two competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The veteran gymnast said he hopes the government will put more resources into training athletes, and those behind the scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gymnastics is not only [about the] coach and gymnast. We should have many more supporting people, for example the judge, the physiotherapist, the psychologist and other people,” Yuen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Wong, one of the two cycling judges from Hong Kong appointed by the International Federation, echoed Yuen’s views.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Hong Kong, we can organise different kinds or different levels of judge development or training courses and encourage the people to have the qualification to enter the international training courses," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like me, when I prepared for the international commissaire course, I paid [for it] myself,  [so I could] visit different kinds of large-scale events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, who played a leading role on the judging team for cycling at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said he feels proud to be a part of the world's biggest sporting event for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that safety is paramount on the racetrack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We stand on the track to monitor the behaviour of the riders and also the behaviour of different TV broadcast staff members. Because we need to protect all the people on the track,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case any accident happens, the riders will go out of the track with the bike and at that moment [there will be] a serious accident if we don't manage it in a proper way.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that he hopes newcomers can have more exposure to large-scale cycling events in Asia before they become judges.

 Day 14 in Paris saw China mine gold in diving, sprint canoeing, table tennis and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gold rush sees China in second place in the medals table with 33 golds, behind the United States which also has 33 golds, but is in first place due to a higher overall medal count.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look at some of the key moments.

   After three Olympics without any gold medals in women's boxing, China won their second in as many days when Wu Yu beat Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu in the flyweight final on Day 14.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Wu's compatriot Yang Liu could not get past Algeria's Imane Khelif who claimed the gold medal in the women's welterweight boxing category at the Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khelif had been in the spotlight at the Paris Games amid a gender dispute that dominated headlines.

     China successfully defended their Olympic men's team title after beating Sweden in three nail-biting matches as Ma Long cemented his status as one of his country's most accomplished athletes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ma, already the most successful Olympic table tennis player, became the most decorated Olympian in China's history with six gold medals.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Although the national team overcame Sweden 3-0, each match was a five-game thriller as the seventh-seeded Swedes pushed them all the way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both Sweden and France celebrated their first ever medals in the table tennis team event, also marking the first time two European nations have stood on the podium.

       China came very close to winning an historic gold medal in women's field hockey, but in the end came up short against the Netherlands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Netherlands completed a remarkable double in Olympic hockey when their women's team, the defending champions, beat China 3-1 in a shootout to take gold just 24 hours after the men's side had triumphed over Germany.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Dutch women, who were appearing in their sixth successive final, were made to work hard for their fifth Olympic gold medal after China held them to a 1-1 draw in regulation time.

        Sha'Carri Richardson powered the US to an Olympic sprint relay gold with a storming anchor leg.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Richardson turned on the afterburners to overhaul Britain, Germany and France in the home straight as the US quartet took gold.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But on a wet track at the Stade de France, the US men again failed in their bid to win their first 4x100m gold since Sydney in 2000 with a disastrous baton fumble.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Already missing 100m individual champion Noah Lyles through Covid, a botched baton change completely slowed the US momentum, allowing Canada to snatch gold ahead of South Africa and Britain.

         Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time as Spain took gold in the Olympic men’s soccer final after a 5-3 win against France on Friday.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The thrilling win at Parc des Princes completed a golden summer for Spanish soccer — following the senior team's European Championship triumph last month.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         France came back from 3-1 down to send the game to extra time when Jean-Phillipe Mateta equalised from the penalty spot in the third minute of time added on.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         But substitute Camello coolly lifted over France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes in the 100th and got his second in the first minute of time added on.

 The urban sport of breaking spun its way onto the Olympic stage on Friday for the first and possibly last time, with Japan's B-Girl Ami winning the inaugural women's gold.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Breaking, better known as breakdancing, made its debut amid the grand elegance of Paris' Place de la Concorde, with 17 dancers known as B-Girls going head-to-head in a series of battles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ami, whose name is Ami Yuasa, beat Lithuania's Dominika "Nicka" Banevic in the final, with China's Liu "671" Qingyi taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport's appearance at the Olympics could be a fleeting one however, having already been dropped from the Los Angeles 2028 programme and no guarantees it will return in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was disappointing it was decided that it wouldn't be in LA, particularly before we even had a chance to show it," said Australian B-Girl Rachel "Raygun" Gunn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that was possibly a little premature. I wonder if they're kicking themselves now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers ensured breaking made the most of its time in the spotlight in Paris, pumping up the volume for an excited crowd that included rapper Snoop Dogg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each battle sees B-Girls take turns to lay down their dance moves over a set number of rounds, with a panel of judges determining the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition opened with a pool stage featuring four groups of four B-Girls, before moving onto the knockout round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first contest of the day was between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, known by her B-Girl name India, and Refugee Olympic Team competitor Talash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talash, whose real name is Manizha Talash, left Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to live in Spain two years ago and danced wearing a blue cape with "Free Afghan Women" printed on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's competition takes place on Saturday. (AFP)

 US sprint star Sha'Carri Richardson struck gold with a relay rescue act as Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam sealed her place in the pantheon of Olympic greats with a third consecutive heptathlon title on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Another spellbinding night of athletics action at the Stade de France saw the United States add to their gold medal tally thanks to a stunning last leg from sprint star Richardson in the women's 4x100m relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US's highly fancied men's relay quartet however finished empty-handed after a disastrous performance saw them disqualified, with Canada storming to a memorable victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's 10,000m, Kenya's Beatrice Chebet completed a long distance double with her second gold medal of the games, four days after triumphing in the 5,000m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a masterful performance from the diminutive East African known as the "smiling assassin", who timed her finish to perfection to scamper home in 30minutes 43.25 seconds, ahead of Italy's Nadia Battocletti (silver) and Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's shot put saw Germany's Yemisi Ogunleye snatch a dramatic gold medal with her final attempt, a last-ditch heave of 20.00m taking her past New Zealand's Maddison-Lee Wesche, who threw 19.86m. China's Song Jiayuan won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's triple jump, Spain's Jordan Diaz won gold with a jump of 17.86m, with Portugal's Pedro Pichardo taking silver and Andy Diaz of Italy claiming bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were golds too for the Dominican Republic's Mari Marileidy Paulino in the women's 400m, while the men's 400m hurdles saw the United States add to their gold tally with Rai Benjamin outfoxing Norway's Karsten Warholm to claim gold. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Controversial boxer Imane Khelif is officially queen of the ring, winning an Olympic gold medal amid a gender row which has cast a shadow over her Paris campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Algerian defeated China's Yang Liu by unanimous decision in the women's 66kg gold medal bout, with all three rounds going in her favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang, the reigning Asian Games champion, was unable to repel Khelif's fast and powerful punches, often retreating while failing to land good hits on her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was written on the wall even before the umpire made the announcement, with Khelif already holding one arm in the air looking ready to celebrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was consolation for China earlier on Friday night, after Wu Yu clinched gold in the women's 50kg by taking a 4-1 split decision over Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu.

 There was heartbreak for China's women's hockey team after they were beaten in the final by the Netherlands in a shootout, despite leading the defending champions most of the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was China's second silver medal in the sport, equalling their best-ever finish in Beijing in 2008 when they were also defeated by the Dutch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China nearly pulled off a remarkable upset after Chen Yi put the underdogs ahead just six minutes into the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands then laid siege in front of the Chinese goal, but couldn't find the equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finally broke down the stubborn defence nine minutes from time, when Yibbi Jansen found just enough space to fire home from a penalty corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides were unable to score again in regulation, and the match had to be decided by a shootout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anne Veenendaal put on a goalkeeping clinic, making three saves to deny China, and helping the Dutch claim their fifth women's crown in six Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended higher on Friday after a tumultuous week in which markets clawed their way back from Monday's steep dive that was prompted by fears of a recession and unwinding of a global yen-funded carry trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to end at 5,344, the Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.5 percent to 16,745. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 percent to 39,497.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology sector led gains in the index for the day, while the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's "fear gauge", was down on Friday after surging to 65.73 at the start of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Fed policymakers expressed confidence that inflation was cooling enough to allow interest-rate cuts ahead, and will take their cues on the size and timing of those cuts from the economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's big decline followed a sharp sell-off last week as a weaker-than-expected July jobs report sparked recession fears, and the Bank of Japan's decision to hike interest rates on July 31 led to a sharp appreciation in the yen. That resulted in the unwinding of currency carry trade positions in which the yen is used to buy high-yielding assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For most of the last week the negative opinions were driving sentiment and direction and those have been outweighed by a little less pessimism," in recent days, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he said, "there is going to continue to be a significant amount of uncertainty and anxiety hanging over the market for the course of the next month until we get to the next Fed meeting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors see a 55 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on September 17-18, with a 25 basis point cut seen as having a 45 percent probability, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors also await next week's readings on US consumer prices and retail sales for July, which could provide fresh evidence on the chances of a soft landing for the American economy. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Friday it had filed an appeal with the World Trade Organization over the European Union's imposition of additional tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In July, the EU slapped extra provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EVs after its executive arm concluded in an investigation that they were unfairly undermining European rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On August 9, China appealed to the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism over the EU's temporary anti-subsidy measures on EVs," a spokesperson for the country's commerce ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said the appeal aimed to "safeguard the development rights and interests of the electric vehicle industry and cooperation over the global green transformation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU's preliminary ruling lacks a factual and legal basis, seriously violates WTO rules, and undermines the overall situation of global cooperation in addressing climate change," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We urge the EU to immediately correct its wrong practices and jointly maintain the stability of China-EU economic and trade cooperation as well as EV industrial and supply chains."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels said it took note of Beijing's move but was "confident" its probe and provisional measures were WTO-compatible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU is carefully studying all the details of this request and will react to the Chinese authorities in due course according to the WTO procedures," a European Commission spokesperson told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Geneva, WTO spokesman Ismaila Dieng said the organization had received the Chinese request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further information will be made available once the request has been circulated to WTO members," Dieng added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Definitive duties are due to take effect by November for a five-year period, pending a vote by the EU's 27 states. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time to settle a remarkable Olympic men's football final on Friday as Spain beat France 5-3 to take gold after the hosts had earlier staged a dramatic comeback.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It had looked as though Spain were going to run away with victory at the Parc des Princes in Paris when they recovered from conceding an early goal to lead 3-1 by half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enzo Millot put France in front, but a Fermin Lopez brace and an Alex Baena free-kick turned the final completely on its head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, France staged a memorable comeback with Maghnes Akliouche pulling a goal back before Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a stoppage-time penalty awarded following a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That took the final into extra time, where Rayo Vallecano forward Camello emerged as the hero by giving Spain the lead again in the 100th minute of an absorbing game, and then running away to seal their victory at the death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Silver medallists in Tokyo three years ago, it is the second time Spain have won Olympic men's football gold after their victory in Barcelona in 1992 with a squad featuring Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France had hoped for a second gold of their own, 40 years after winning in Los Angeles, but instead have to settle for silver. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s men’s table tennis team of Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Fan Zhendong on Friday took gold at the Paris Olympics, beating the seventh seeded Swedish team 3-0.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This is the fifth straight gold medal for the men's team at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three matches between the teams went the distance and went on for more than two and a half hours at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the opening doubles match, Ma and Wang dropped the opening game against Swedish duo Anton Kallberg and Kristian Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the national team came back strong and won the next two games 11-4 and 11-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the fourth game to Sweden 6-11 and took the final game 11-7 to win the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan, who struck gold in the men’s singles in Paris, took on Sweden’s Truls Moregard in the second match. It went back and forth before Fan pulled through for a 3-2 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one paddler Wang started strong in the third match and won the first two games 11-9 and 11-5, before losing the next two to Sweden’s Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang beat Karlsson 11-2 in the fifth and decisive game, sealing gold for China.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Chen Yiwen triumphed in the women's 3m springboard final on Friday at the Paris Olympics, putting the national team one gold medal away from achieving all eight diving crowns at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chen, who is a first-time Olympian, performed five stellar dives leading the scoreboard throughout all five rounds. She earned a total of 376.00 to top the podium – over 30 points ahead of the silver medallist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old attempted a forward 3 ½ somersaults pike in the fourth round, making this her best dive and earning her a 77.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Chen’s second gold at these Games, where she also won the women’s synchronised 3m springboard with teammate Chang Yani.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia’s Maddison Keeney came in second, maintaining the silver spot throughout the competition with a score of 343.10. Her last forward 2 ½ somersaults 2 twists pike dive earned her a 78.20, the highest score received in the entire competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chang wasn’t able to replicate the success she had in the synchronised diving having had a rough start finishing at the end of the pack in round one, but she was able to catch up by the fourth round to secure the bronze with a 318.75.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men’s 10m platform final – the last diving event of the Games – begins on Saturday at 9pm Hong Kong time, where China is looking to complete a clean sweep of golds in all eight diving events.

    Ocean Park unveils study on late male panda An An

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A study on one of the Hong Kong's beloved giant pandas could shed light on life-long care for the animals, according to researchers who had monitored the late An An.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park on Friday said it had conducted a study on the world's oldest zoo-housed male giant panda, covering the final two years of his life and tracking his activities, movement patterns, and habitat preferences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Results showed that An An, who lived 35 years or roughly 105 human years, conserved energy by favouring gentle slopes when going uphill and steeper paths when descending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said this behaviour – which led the animal to cover greater distances uphill than downhill – mirrored that of wild giant pandas, researchers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park's senior research fellow, Eszter Matrai, said the study will help improve future enclosure designs for ageing pandas and can also be considered for other animals at zoos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This provides an objective measure of lifestyle changes based on life stages in terms of age and illnesses. The results can be used for habitat optimisation and sustainable improvement for life-long care,” Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the study contributed to the limited literature on the behaviour of geriatric animals, because previous studies on ageing pandas had primarily focused on veterinary medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These findings go beyond design enhancements, guiding tailored care plans and enrichment activities based on age-related behavioural changes and seasonal variations," Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An An was one of two giant pandas gifted by the central government to Hong Kong in 1999. He died in July 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese pair of Xu Shixiao and Sun Mengya powered to victory in the women's canoe double 500 metre final at the Paris Games on Friday, setting a new Olympic record of 1:52.81 and breaking the mark of 1:53.73 that they set earlier in the day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Liudmyla Luzan and Anastasiia Rybachok came in second to take silver, with Canada's Sloan Mackenzie and Katie Vincent finishing third to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a tailwind providing some of the choppiest waters seen at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, Xu and Sun got off to an excellent start but the Canadians kept the pressure on them before fading over the final stretch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the national team's second canoe sprint medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's freestyle wrestler Zou Wanhao was not able to make a comeback in the men’s 57 kilogramme category at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old lost by a final score of 7-4 to Kyrgyzstan's Bekzat Almaz Uulu in the repechage, bringing his debut Olympic run to an end.

  Uulu will next face Gulomjon Abdullaev of Uzbekistan in the bronze medal bout. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR is sending 23 athletes to Paris for the upcoming Paralympic Games, with prize rewards nearly doubled to reward Paralympians.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The athletes representing Hong Kong, China, are set to compete in eight sports. The squad includes wheelchair fencer Alison Yu, who will be competing at the Paralympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu, who has won seven Paralympic gold medals, three silvers and one bronze, said it is important to get into the right mindset in the last weeks leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so looking forward to competing at the Grand Palais... In the Olympic Games, we saw Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong get gold medals at the Grand Palais, so I think the Grand Palais is a lucky place for us," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to relax a bit from fencing, not thinking so much about fencing and trying to be ready mentally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For rider Natasha Tse, she said it is an honour to compete for the SAR in her fourth Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My challenges in this Games are on how to get used to my new horse, or how to get used to the weather, or even the accuracy in my test," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Paralympian Leung Chung-yan, who will compete in the men's table tennis singles, said he is excited to play and hopes to win a match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officiating at the flag ceremony ahead of the Games, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to higher rewards for Paralympians, with a gold medal winning solo athlete set to receive HK$1.5 million. He also said the entire city is behind the SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of you have overcome various challenges to reach the pinnacle of sport, competing with athletes from all over the world on the Paralympic stage. We are proud of you," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your participation not only represents your personal efforts and achievements but also represent Hong Kong's support and recognition of parasports."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Paralympics will run from August 28 to September 8.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday raised concerns about a rodent problem in the back alleys of Wan Chai and called for government intervention to tackle it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department shows that Wan Chai is the most infested of Hong Kong's 18 districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent DAB survey of over 800 shopkeepers and residents in the area, more than 70 percent said they had encountered rodents on the streets between May and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jennifer Chow, chairwoman of the party's Wan Chai branch, said the three main hotspots identified in the district were Bowrington Road Market, Yat Sin Street and Wing Hing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some residents saw rats climbing up the pipes into their homes and they were very frightened. We have to do more in terms of cleaning the environment to prevent the rats from going down the street," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hotspots are mostly the back lanes of the private property that is not the government area. So that's the most difficult thing that they face because they don't have any support from the government to clean or to prevent most of the rubbish in their back lane."

    Philippine court allows Rappler to keep operating

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Philippine news site co-founded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa can continue operating after a court overturned a shutdown order, according to the ruling released on Friday, in the latest legal victory for the media outfit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ressa and Rappler have been fighting multiple court cases filed during former president Rodrigo Duterte's administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, was a vocal critic of Duterte and the deadly drug war he launched in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That triggered what media advocates say was a grinding series of criminal charges, probes and online attacks against her and Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeals decision, issued on July 23 but only released to the media on Friday, reversed a previous ruling by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had ordered the shutdown of Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC order had been a "grave abuse of discretion" and contravened "established procedures, jurisprudential and legal instructions, and clear intent of the Constitution", the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC shutdown order was issued on June 28, 2022, days before Duterte left office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It revoked Rappler's "certificate of incorporation" for violating constitutional and statutory restrictions on foreign ownership in mass media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rappler has continued operating as it appealed the SEC order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the constitution, investment in media is reserved for Filipinos or Filipino-controlled entities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case sprang from the 2015 investment from the US-based Omidyar Network, which was established by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Omidyar later transferred its investment in Rappler to the site's local managers to stave off efforts by Duterte to shut it down. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 We've heard a lot over the past two weeks about athletes battling it out for the gold medal at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  What about ordinary people like you and I?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While our gold medal moments may not involve winning a place on the podium, we've all experienced things in life that made us incredibly happy or proud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK spoke to people in Paris and Hong Kong, and asked them what they felt were their proudest or most joyous moments.

    Discovery Bay ferry fares to rise from Sunday

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The fare hike for ferry trips between Central and Discovery Bay takes effect on August 11. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765482_1_20240809150425.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People travelling on the Discovery Bay ferry to and from Central will pay up to 21 percent more per trip from August 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Adult residents using Octopus Cards registered with the ferry operator will see the fare for the 25-minute journey go up from HK$33.5 to HK$38.2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares will increase to HK$24 for those aged 65 or above, and to HK$19.1 for full-time students under 26, as well as children under 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices for those without registered cards will go up from HK$46 to HK$55.8, with the discounted rate for seniors and children rising from HK$23 to HK$27.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase approved by the government is lower than the 60 percent the ferry operator, Discovery Bay Transportation Services, had requested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to Islands District Council, the Transport Department noted that the fares were last raised in June 2018. It said the number of passengers had dropped, while operating costs continued to rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The revenue generated by the ferry service has been insufficient to cover the rising operating costs. In addition, the cumulative inflation rate has reached double digits since the last fare adjustment," the department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In granting the fare hike, the authorities said they had taken in account a number of factors, such as operating costs, revenues and the level of public acceptance of the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department also said the ferry operator should continue to "explore feasible measures" to improve its financial situation.

    URA announces Ma Tau Wai Road redevelopment project

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Friday unveiled plans for a HK$1 billion redevelopment project in To Kwa Wan that will affect around 180 households and 20 shops.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blocks with even numbers between 324 and 354 Ma Tau Wai Road will be demolished. The buildings are three to nine storeys high and were constructed between 55 and 69 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA said the blocks, containing many subdivided flats, have been poorly maintained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New buildings up to 120 metres in height will be built, offering around 230 residential units, with the blocks linked to nearby open space and an underground shopping street leading to To Kwa Wan MTR Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michelle Tong, the URA’s general manager for acquisition and clearance, outlined the compensation available for the flat and shop owners and residents affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will offer acquisition consideration to the owners and the value will be based on the market value at the time when we issue the acquisition offer. We will ask surveyors appointed through ballot to assess the market value and the home purchase allowance value at the time before the offer was issued,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the tenants, we will check their eligibility and if they fulfil the eligibility then we will offer the ex-gratia allowance or the rehousing arrangement.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A freezing survey will commence on Friday, followed by a public consultation exercise from September 25 to October 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA said it expects the project to be completed by 2033 or 2034, assuming no appeals are filed against it.

    Trend favours virtual banks, says lawmaker Johnny Ng

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ng said people are often unaware that virtual banks have the same HK$500,000 deposit protection as traditional banks. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765432_1_20240809090016.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Johnny Ng says Hong Kong's virtual banks still probably need a couple more years to turn a profit, if similar banks in the UK and Germany are an indicator, although the trend is in their favour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Virtual banks have been operating here since 2020 and a recent report released by the Monetary Authority shows the SAR's eight virtual banks are still in the red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 2.2 million people use these banks, but their deposits account for only 0.3 percent of total savings among all Hong Kong banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Ng says they are gaining ground, especially among the young, as they can offer attractive 1-year fixed rate deposits and other offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people are often unaware that they have the same deposit protection as traditional banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, the protection is the same for HK$500,000 deposit in the bank which is protected by insurance of all banks, including traditional banks and also the virtual banks," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So you can see the trend... people moving, especially young people, moving from the traditional bank to use the virtual banks. Also they provide a lot of attractions and promotion offers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng also said that, unlike traditional banks, virtual banks don't require a minimum deposit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's virtual banks are ZA Bank, WeLab Bank, Mox Bank, Ant Bank, Livi Bank, Ping An One Connect Bank, Airstar Bank, and Fusion Bank.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fans can now travel back in time to catch a glimpse of what the Paris Games were like a century ago, thanks to new AI-powered cloud tech that can bring historic moments back to life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alibaba Cloud, a partner of the International Olympic Committee, is supporting the Games through cloud computing and e-commerce platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris Tung, president of Alibaba Group’s strategic development, said the tech giant is using generative AI to restore videos and colourise moments from when the French capital last hosted the Olympics in 1924.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By doing that, we'll be able to represent the glorious moments of Olympic Games in the past and be able to come up with concepts and stories to spread Olympic spirit and culture,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tung said that cloud infrastructure has overtaken satellites as the primary source of television broadcasts for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It has been more than 50 years that we watched exciting Olympic games on TV through satellite,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For Paris 2024, this will be the first time that cloud-based broadcasting exceeds the volume of satellite-based [broadcasts]. So it's a great building block from game to game, from flame to flame that we're doing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba Cloud has also built a data management platform for all Olympic venues, which they use to monitor and analyse energy consumption and carbon emission data, in line with the organisers’ goal of making the Paris Games the greenest ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding privacy concerns, Tung said all visitors’ personal data will be removed after 24 hours, while audio clips and videos will only be kept for less than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, mainland EV maker Xpeng has decided to make its debut on the French market in Paris to make the most of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now you are with the Olympics, this is the most beautiful city in the world. That was the perfect platform to launch such a premium brand,” said Thomas Rodier, head of marketing and communication at Xpeng France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very invested in leading EV technology, but also autonomous driving technologies where we are [a] leader in China, and soon, I hope in Europe," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodier also said provisional EU duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EV imports will not affect Xpeng's business in France.

 The United States kept the dream alive with a stirring fourth quarter rally to tame feisty Serbia 95-91 and move into the Paris Olympics men's basketball gold medal final against France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trailing by double digits for much of the game and down 76-63 heading into the fourth quarter, the United States chances of a fifth consecutive gold were quickly dimming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then NBA stars LeBron James and Stephen Curry took charge, bringing a wide-eyed capacity crowd at the Bercy Arena to their feet with a furious fight back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Curry made nine three-pointers on his way to lead all scorers with 36 points, while James finished with a triple double of 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A turning point of the game came with more than seven minutes left in the final period, when Serbia's star center Nikola Jokic committed a foul on Anthony Davis when American forward Kevin Durant made a three pointer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foul meant the US maintained possession of the ball, and Devin Booker hit another triple on the ensuing possession to cut the deficit to five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Curry made a three pointer for an 87-86 lead with around two minutes to go for the Americans' first lead since the first quarter, as they hung on for the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US win delivered the final basketball fans wanted to see and is sure to be one of the Paris Olympics highlights, as the Americans take on an inspired France on Saturday, in what will be a hostile Bercy cauldron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolstered by an electric home crowd, a turbo-charged France won a 73-69 thriller over Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France was led by a 17-point effort from Guerschon Yabusele while Isaia Cordinier chipped in 16, none more important than two free throws with seven seconds to play to blunt a Germany fight back and seal victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the national team, this jersey brings to us that different energy that we can't find nowhere else," said Victor Wembanyama, the first Frenchman to be taken number one overall in the NBA draft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can see how intense we've been over the last two games. It's something that we all feel as patriots. We love our jersey. We love our country." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese boxer Chang Yuan dominated from the opening bell to land gold in the women's 54kg final at the Paris Olympics on Friday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old from Hebei province landed a series of blows on her opponent, Turkey's Hatice Akbas, to win a unanimous points victory from the judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang was ahead on four of the five cards after the first round, when Akbas showed occasional signs of danger, but took full control for the latter two three-minute sections, scoring ahead on every card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In truth, Chang had been tested more heavily in earlier rounds, including in a split decision victory over the North Korean, Pang Cholmi, in the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the national team's 29th gold of the Games and the first in boxing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Chinese fighter, Li Qian, made it to the women's 75kg final thanks to a victory by unanimous decision over Caitlin Parker of Australia in Friday's semi-final.
