    Works to build Hung Shui Kiu MTR Station begins

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Friday said preparatory work had begun for the construction of Hung Shui Kiu Station on the Tuen Ma Line.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The railway firm said construction of the new station, located between Siu Hong and Tin Shui Wai, was expected to be completed in 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walter Lam, MTR’s project manager overseeing the project, said this is the first time they are adding a station to an operating viaduct, on which the Tuen Ma Line runs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s about 10 to 11 metres above ground. We have a massive high-level working platform. And we don’t want to touch anything on top -- what I mean is the existing utilities, the existing overhead lines. We have to turn off the power,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam noted that one of the biggest challenges is they only have around six non-traffic hours a week to work at the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they had recently started removing a 400-metre segment of the parapet to make room for the new station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Before we cut [the parapet], we have temporary support holding it in place, making sure it won’t move, it’s stable, and it’s safe. It won’t affect the operation on the next day,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engineer said they would, at the next stage, build a foundation for the new station that is made of pre-cast components.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hung Shui Kiu Station should open in 2030, when residents in the new development area are expected to move in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR said work was also starting this year to build new stations like Oyster Bay on the Tung Chung Line and Kwu Tung on the East Rail Line.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 8,000 students of a private vocational college have been affected by a cyber attack, the privacy watchdog said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong College of Technology said its information technology network and file server were hacked in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A ransomware group is believed to have got hold of 450GB of the college's data and the information was made public on the dark web on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not an ordinary attack, but a highly targeted and unusual cyber attack. The Hong Kong College of Technology condemns any cyber crimes and deeply apologises for any inconvenience and troubles caused by the incident," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The college said it reported the breach to the police and the privacy commissioner's office, shut down the affected system, and launched a probe with the help of independent cyber security experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it will provide credit monitoring and dark web monitoring services to those affected for half a year at no cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, the privacy commissioner's office said it was informed about the data breach on February 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said about 8,100 students had been affected and information involved included names, identity card numbers, emails, telephone numbers and addresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau urged the college to comprehensively investigate the incident and to take appropriate measures to strengthen network security to prevent further similar attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they are investigating the matter but no arrests have been made so far.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752602_1_20240510132922.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior government officials have lauded Southern District care teams for their dedication in serving the community, saying they urgently address the needs of citizens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Home and Youth Affairs Secretary Alice Mak attended a ceremony in Aberdeen on Friday to celebrate the teams' first year of operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan singled out the response to a landslide in Shek O Road last September for particular praise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that care teams were promptly deployed to various locations to provide food and other items to those affected by the landslide by boat, and helped with temporary accommodation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak, meanwhile, said the care teams have exceeded their performance targets, paying visits to 11,000 households and handling over 1,500 enquiries throughout the past year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tasks they handled ranged from home repairs, to technology assistance and form-filling support, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said the teams also organised more than 300 activities, including national education seminars, festive celebrations and policy promotion events in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said care teams across Hong Kong visited 90,000 households last year, adding that a review of the scheme will be carried out next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The first phase of the care team services last for two years and after two years we will definitely review the whole scheme and see how we can enhance and improve the scheme so that more residents can benefit and we can provide more district-based services to our residents,” she said.

    950,000 targeted in new poverty alleviation framework

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says the current poverty line may lead to an 'overestimation' of the poverty situation in Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752596_1_20240510123658.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation, in a bid to measure the city's poverty more effectively.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 555,000 senior citizens, 213,000 single-parent families and 214,000 people living in subdivided flats are included.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Legco paper, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the move was based on the latest statistics of household characteristics, employment and income conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since 2013, the official measure of poverty has been defined as living in a household with a monthly income below 50 percent of the median.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the bureau said the current measurement may lead to an "overestimation" of the poverty situation in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the 'poverty line' was formulated based on the concept of 'relative poverty', poor households will always exist under 'relative poverty' regardless of the effectiveness of the poverty alleviation work," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This may create the wrong impression to the public that 'more people become poor despite more resources being put in'. These limitations will in the long run weaken the function of the 'poverty line' in monitoring the actual poverty situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau added that officials will offer help to the three target groups through various poverty alleviation projects, and set key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the new poverty framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to discuss the paper during a welfare services panel meeting next Monday.

    Pre-registration for dental clinics not ideal: govt
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pre-registration for dental clinics not ideal: govt" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752583_1_20240510104850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials have conceded that the pre-registration system for public dental clinics is not an ideal arrangement, saying a planned digital ticketing system will be a better alternative than late-night queues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the government pledged to finish the development of an electronic system within this year and provide assistance to people who are not tech-savvy to secure a slot to see a dentist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government earlier announced that from July, people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, rather than from midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some lawmakers on the public accounts committee complained that bringing forward the preliminary registration hours will not shorten queuing times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, I want to emphasise again that if we cannot meet the demand for service, then there will be a need to have a disc allocation. And if you have to ask people to come and queue, then definitely they will all try to come as soon as possible, and there will be a waiting time for them," Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told the legislators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now try to put in place a better arrangement, so the preliminary registration will be changed to 8pm the night before. I want to emphasise that this is not the ideal arrangement. But we just want to reduce the waiting time for the elderly. So the solution will be electronic registration."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that it would be a "utopian thought" to have no queues at clinics, saying it would require a large number of medical staff providing services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also be a waste of the city's medical resources, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of Health Ronald Lam, for his part, promised that an electronic system would be ready within this year, as authorities are hammering out details with the contractors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told lawmakers that officials will assist those who are not tech-savvy in making registrations on the platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the vaccination drive for Covid, there were a number of service points set up to help elderly people who are not familiar with technology to make a booking. There are still a lot of service points running in the community," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once we have completed developing the platform, we will offer assistance to elderly people should they need it via these existing service points."

    Parents key to student mental health: expert

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The number of primary and secondary school students diagnosed with mental illness has more than tripled in the past five years. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752562_2_20240510120227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A clinical psychologist warned on Friday that he's noted a link between students' mental health and their relationships with parents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amos Cheung, a newly-appointed member of the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said the focus should be on how to improve parents' mental well-being and communication skills, so they can be good role models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent Education Bureau figures show that the number of primary and secondary school students diagnosed with mental illness has more than tripled in the past five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he'd noted from his own private practice that students' poor mental health was often related to conflict with family members, and many young people felt that "their conditions were not well understood by their parents ... and] parents have their own agendas to drive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he stressed that a variety of pressures were involved, including better identification of possible mental health issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that actually it's a multiple-factors problem. Well, first, [it] might be an indication that actually parents, teachers are now more sensitive to the mental health conditions of young people, so with improved and increased sensitivity, of course, there will be an increase of these diagnoses," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But, of course, at the same time, it might also mean that, well, the mental health conditions in general might be worsening among these students as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said students learned from adults around them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children and even adolescents, they are not fully developed and equipped in handling their emotions. Actually they learn from adults. So when the adults around them, if their mental health, if their mental well-being, if their emotional stability are actually already compromised or not established, then of course it will increase their chances of having some of the mental health issues, especially emotionally related," he said.
  <br/>
  He said the focus should be on how to improve the mental well-being and the communication skills of parents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because parents are the major key players in all of these things. So that when parents are already good emotion facilitators and communicators, then of course, the mental well-being and the student's ability to actually handle their emotions, would, of course, improve," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell tossed in a game-high 29 points and the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers pulled even in the Eastern Conference second round by beating the Boston Celtics 118-94 in Game 2 on Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mitchell had six points at halftime, but scored 16 in the third quarter and seven in the fourth. He was 10 of 19 from the field, including 5 of 7 from 3-point territory. Mitchell tossed in a game-high 33 points when Boston earned a 120-95 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland led by 12 after three quarters, and pushed the lead to 25 after a Caris LeVert three-point play with 4:58 remaining. Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters off the court at that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half, Cleveland's Evan Mobley had 21 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. LeVert [21], Darius Garland [14], Isaac Okoro [12] and Max Strus [12] also scored in double figures for the Cavaliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum had 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists for the Celtics, who shot 8 of 35 from 3-point territory. Jaylen Brown added 19 points for Boston, but was 0 for 6 on 3-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The series will shift to Cleveland for Game 3 on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland center Jarrett Allen missed his fifth straight game with a rib injury. The Celtics were without center Kristaps Porzingis, who has missed the last three games because of a right calf injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics led by nine early, but Cleveland had a nine-point lead, 30-21, after LeVert capped an 11-0 run by making a layup with 58.3 remaining in the first quarter. The Cavaliers had a 30-24 edge after 12 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston owned an eight-point lead late in the second quarter, but Cleveland closed the quarter on an 11-3 run to tie it at 54 at halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavaliers outscored the Celtics 36-24 in the third and had a 90-78 lead when Mitchell made a 3-pointer that just beat the buzzer at the end of the quarter. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel qualified for this weekend's Eurovision song contest grand finale as thousands of demonstrators marched through Sweden's Malmo on Thursday to protest its participation over the Gaza war.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Singer Eden Golan performed her song "Hurricane" in Thursday's second semi-final without incident in front of 9,000 spectators at the Malmo Arena and booked her place in Saturday's final after a televote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the day, more than 10,000 people including climate activist Greta Thunberg gathered in Malmo's main square before marching through the southern city's central pedestrian shopping street, according to police estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am a Eurovision fan and it breaks my heart, but I'm boycotting," 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alongside signs that read: "Liberate Palestine", banners that said "EUR legitimises genocide" and "colonialism cannot be washed in pink" could be seen in the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 50 protesters made it to the front of the Malmo Arena, where the event is taking place, before being dispersed by a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters also entered the Eurovision Village, where spectators can follow the concert on large screens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a different neighbourhood, about 100 counter-protesters gathered under police protection to express their support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Thursday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday wished Golan good luck and said she had "already won" by enduring the protests that he called a "horrible wave of anti-Semitism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?" said protester Marwo Mustafa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane" has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition, which opened with the first semi-final on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: "At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it." (AFP)

    First faculty-led Gaza protest encampment set up in NY

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Faculty members of The New School, a private university in New York, on Wednesday set up a pro-Palestine encampment in the lobby of the campus building near Union Square in what’s reportedly the first faculty-led protest in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New School Free Press reported that protesting staff are calling for measures such as divestment from weapons manufacturing companies, dismissal of charges against student protesters and the removal of New York police on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 professors occupied the lobby with tents and banners reading "Faculty Against Genocide."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The staff at The New School named their encampment after Refaat Alareer, a Palestinian poet and professor, who was killed in an airstrike in December 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes almost a week after after police cleared an earlier encampment and arrested around 40 students who were subsequently suspended from the New School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the United States, with more than 2,500 people arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges cracked down immediately, while others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in the police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Boston, police detained several people on Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after demonstrators blocked a parking garage in their ongoing protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters have been asking administrators to end all research contracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which they estimate total US$11 million since 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the school issued an alert just before 2 pm local time, saying protesters were blocking the entrance to a campus parking garage and spilling onto a nearby street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About two hours later, authorities split protesters up and pushed them away from the garage. At least three people were detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters walked away continuing to chant “free Palestine.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MIT officials said later Thursday that fewer than 10 people were arrested by MIT police during the incident and the Stata Garage and Vassar Street were reopened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Didehbani, an MIT student and one of the leaders of the protest, said the decision to block the garage was part of a larger effort to bring attention to what she described as MIT’s complicity with the Israeli military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Didehbani said she has been issued a suspension and an eviction notice by the school but said MIT cannot suspend the larger student movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They’d much rather do those things than cut ties to a state that is currently enacting a genocide,” she said. (Xinhua, AP)

 Leverkusen reach Europa League final after Roma draw extends unbeaten run
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen staged a stunning late comeback to move into the Europa League final with a 2-2 draw at home against AS Roma on Thursday as they won 4-2 on aggregate and set the longest unbeaten run in all competitions including European matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bundesliga champions Leverkusen, who have also reached this month's German Cup final as they chase a treble, played their 49th match without defeat to surpass Benfica's record set from 1963–65 but they had to battle for the second leg draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xabi Alonso's side, who have 40 wins in their unbeaten run, will face Italian side Atalanta in the May 22 final in Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be a third European final for Leverkusen, who won their only continental title when they lifted the UEFA Cup in 1988 and lost in the 2002 Champions League showpiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roma knew they had a mountain to climb after losing the first leg 2-0 at home but they remained composed in an evenly contested match in which Leverkusen gradually seized control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios struck the post just before halftime, with the rebound deflecting off Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar's back, but Evan Ndicka cleared the danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Svilar then made another acrobatic save just before the break, denying Amine Adli and then blocking the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Leverkusen's pressure Roma took the lead with a penalty from Leandro Paredes just before halftime after Jonathan Tah fouled Sardar Azmoun. Paredes scored with another spot kick in the 66th minute after Adam Hlozek handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With eight minutes remaining, a Leverkusen corner confused the visiting defence, including the until then excellent Svilar, leading to defender Gianluca Mancini inadvertently deflecting the ball into his own net at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late substitute Joseph Stanisic then secured Leverkusen's place in the record books deep into stoppage time with the equaliser after a skilful move into the box to delight the ecstatic home fans and leave battling Roma distraught. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Hungary decided on Thursday to elevate bilateral relations to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision was announced during talks between President Xi Jinping and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said this year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Hungary, ushering in a new and important opportunity for the development of bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two countries should continue to be good friends, sharing mutual trust and assistance, and partners of win-win cooperation. Xi called on both countries to take the establishment of the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era as an opportunity to inject new and strong impetus into bilateral cooperation and create a better future for the peoples of both nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that China-Hungary relations are currently at the best period in history, and with a deepening political mutual trust and fruitful cooperation in various fields, the two countries have set a model for building a new type of international relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Hungarian government, at least 16 different agreements promoting cooperation with China in rail and road infrastructure, nuclear energy and the automotive industry are to be signed. (Xinhua/AFP)

    US stocks rise on hopes of interest rate cuts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks climbed on Thursday as economic data raised hopes that the US central bank is on track for interest rate cuts later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.9 percent to 39,387, while the S&P 500 jumped 0.5 percent to 5,214.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq added 0.3 percent to 16,346.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gains came after initial jobless claims rose to the highest level since last August, to 231,000 for the week ending May 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A higher level of claims – if the trend persists – could be seen as a sign of the labour market cooling down, giving the Federal Reserve impetus to lower interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the higher unemployment claims has helped bond markets. US Treasury bond yields, a proxy for interest rates, moved lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rate cuts will depend on subsequent inflation data, he added: "We are seeing some cracks in the labour market and when that happens, that eventually leads to slow economic activity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among companies reporting results, Warner Bros. Discovery closed 3.1 percent up while Arm Holdings slumped by 2.3 percent.
  <br/>

  Airbnb shares slid by 6.9 percent. (AFP)

    TikTok says will label AI-made videos automatically

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says the auto-labelling of AI-generated content will be gradual at first. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752529_1_20240510002408.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok on Thursday said it will begin labelling AI-generated content automatically from several platforms, including OpenAI's Dall-E and the company's own tools and generators.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authentication has become a major concern in the fast development of AI, with authorities worried about the proliferation of deepfakes that could disrupt society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "AI-generated content is an incredible creative outlet, but transparency for viewers is critical," said Adam Presser, Head of Trust & Safety at TikTok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automatic labelling of AI-generated or edited content would be a first for social media platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, said it would begin testing a label "that we eventually plan to apply automatically to content that we detect was edited or created with AI."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company told the Financial Times that this will include content made using Adobe's Firefly tool, TikTok's own AI image generators and OpenAI's Dall-E.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it was joining a coalition of technology and media groups, led by Adobe, that incorporate industry-wide labelling into AI-generated products, sometimes called watermarking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (or C2PA) sets a technical standard to better flag and identify the provenance of AI-generated content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By partnering with peers to label content across platforms, we're making it easy for creators to responsibly explore AI-generated content, while continuing to deter the harmful or misleading AI generated content that is prohibited on TikTok," Presser said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok said that the auto-labelling will be gradual at first, but as more platforms mark their AI-generated content according to the C2PA standard "we'll be able to label more content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company behind the popular image generator Dall-E and ChatGPT, on Tuesday also joined the initiative and announced the launch of a tool aimed at detecting whether digital images have been created by AI. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Israeli official criticised US President Joe Biden on Thursday for threatening to stop certain arms supplies to Israel if it invades the crowded Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war," Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said on public radio in Israel's first reaction to Biden's warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has defied international objections by sending in tanks and conducting "targeted raids" in the eastern areas of Rafah.

  It says Rafah is home to Hamas's last remaining battalions but the city on the border with Egypt is also crammed with displaced Palestinian civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used... to deal with the cities," Biden told CNN, in his starkest warning to Israel since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs," Biden said. "It's just wrong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erdan said Biden's comments would be seen by Israel's foes Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah as "something that gives them hope to succeed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?" he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal battled into the second round of the Rome Open on Thursday after bouncing back from a set down to beat qualifier Zizou Bergs 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay court icon Nadal will face world number nine Hubert Hurkacz next as he continued his comeback from injury with a punishing match against his Belgian opponent which lasted nearly three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Nadal's side of the draw are last year's winner, world number four Daniil Medvedev, and the beaten finalist Holger Rune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He showed glimpses of his old self against Bergs who is ranked 108 in the world and is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outsider Bergs, 24, had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Holger Rune, and he pushed his illustrious rival all the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitting Belgian briefly looked like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take a hard-fought victory. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved sideways on Thursday following mixed earnings reports as weekly US jobless claims pushed higher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jump in initial jobless claims by 22,000 to 231,000 puts the benchmark at the highest level since last August, according to Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data "will be construed as a sign of softening in the labour market," O'Hare said. "That view, in turn, will be construed as a possible trigger for a Fed rate cut in coming months."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data came as the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was up 0.1 percent at 39,098.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,186, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,262.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among companies reporting results, Warner Brothers Discovery advanced 2.0 percent, Arm Holdings dropped 6.3 percent and Airbnb fell 7.2 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has expressed strong dissatisfaction against remarks made by the US State Department regarding the banning of a protest song in the SAR, calling it a blatant interference in the city’s judicial proceedings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman with the office said in a statement that SAR officials had made the right and necessary move to ban people from using the song to incite others to separate Hong Kong from the rest of the country, or insult the national anthem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement noted that the SAR government and the High Court had fulfilled their constitutional responsibility to protect national security as well as the dignity of ‘March of the Volunteers’.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman advised certain politicians to respect the basic principles of international relations and stop interfering in Hong Kong as well as China’s internal affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US State Department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, had earlier described the Court of Appeal’s temporary injunction order to ban ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ as “the latest blow” to the SAR’s international reputation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Xia Baolong, said the central government will continue to support the SAR's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, met Xia in Beijing on Thursday, to brief him on Hong Kong’s efforts in attracting strategic I&T enterprises and talent, as well as the city’s latest developments in areas like digital economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xia said the SAR government's work deserves full recognition, and that Beijing will continue to support Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, for his part, said the SAR administration will "live up to its mission" and continue strengthening I&T co-operation with different mainland cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Xia also met with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung, and expressed the need for Hong Kong to continue developing the tourism sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having experienced profound changes in both the internal and external environment, he said the city's travel industry needs to identify new ways to boost growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMAO chief added that the SAR should adopt the strategy of "tourism everywhere", and develop new routes and products to consolidate Hong Kong's reputation as the best travel destination.

    Mixed views on revised employment agency rules

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752505_1_20240509194043.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There’s been mixed reaction to the government’s revised code of practice for employment agencies that is in part drawn up to deter foreign domestic helpers from "job-hopping".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration rules regarding changes of employer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Employers of Overseas Domestic Helpers Association Betty Yung, welcomed the changes, saying it will be made very clear to workers that they should aim to complete their two-year contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this will at least help to give a very clear concept to all domestic helpers that they should complete the contract because they have signed two years, right?” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung added that the renewed guidelines will have a deterrent effect on agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She told RTHK that during the pandemic, some companies had encouraged helpers to switch jobs to boost income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the period when there were no planes, some agencies had to do their business. They had financial difficulties, so they tried to make business by encouraging some helpers to change jobs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the other hand, Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, said the revised code of practice may discourage helpers from leaving a bad working environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this kind of situation, domestic workers are very vulnerable. They are reluctant to make a report because of language barriers," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have the right to switch jobs in Hong Kong, and that is not clear in the guidelines. [It should be clearly spelled out] what domestic workers need to do if they experience [bad] working conditions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sringatin said however that the revised code, which bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers, will better safeguard their privacy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday said the China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Tamas Sulyok at the Sandor Palace in Budapest, Xi said the friendship between the two nations had taken deep roots among the people, and cooperation in various fields had yielded fruitful outcomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also expressed his readiness to foster a good working relationship and friendship with Sulyok, increase exchanges and communication on matters of mutual interest, and jointly promote the high-level development of bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary and China, which mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations, were also expected to sign at least 16 new cooperation agreements, one of which could be a large-scale infrastructure project linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Budapest late on Wednesday after visiting France and Serbia. It is the last stop on his three-nation tour of Europe. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    EOC issues practical guide for guide dogs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Thursday said it issued a practical guide to foster greater acceptance of guide dogs and their users with visual impairments in society.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EOC conducted interviews with four guide dog users in October last year, and it found that some interviewees experienced disrespectful acts, such as being rejected from entering some premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guide dog user Koonie Chan said many people had misunderstandings about guide dogs, and more education was needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They can't differentiate whether it's guide dog or a pet dog... I got really frustrated. I asked [the waiters], and they said 'You can’t come in because you got a dog'," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EOC said people were allowed to bring their guide dogs into places like restaurants, MTR trains and franchised buses, but there’s no legal protection to ensure guide dogs could enter premises like schools and workplaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the EOC's executive director Ferrick Chu said public awareness should be further enhanced, before making any moves to improve existing legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of low awareness, because of misunderstanding, the better way to do it is through public education... [Whether] it's necessary to write another piece of legislation to extend protection, I think it's up to the community and the legislature," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are currently more than 50 trained guide dogs in service in Hong Kong, and the EOC said some universities are looking into using robotic guide dogs to help people with visual impairments.

    Court hears challenge over golf course plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court was told that an Environmental Impact Assessment had a lot of deficiencies. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752478_1_20240509173016.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Thursday started hearing a bid to overturn the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Hong Kong Golf Club course.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior Counsel Benjamin Yu, for the club, told the court that the Environmental Impact Assessment had a lot of deficiencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He argued that the government had said it would identify trees on the golf course that could be classified as old and valuable, but no such findings were included in the environmental report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The barrister said this is "vital" to the whole judicial review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu also said a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, since authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment, but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said had the club had the opportunity to give further comments, it could have pointed out that an additional study was not comprehensive in assessing the development’s impact on the aquatic habitats at the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawyer noted that critically endangered Chinese Swamp Cypress trees on the golf course are sensitive to hydrological changes, and authorities should tread extra carefully when it is not known how the trees could be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Russell Coleman said the environment should be given “the benefit of the doubt” and should be protected in such situations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu said the report also underrated the site's ecological value, by severely underestimating the different types of bats living there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the report only mentioned one bat species, when a separate study carried out by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department found 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu added that the golf course, which is more than 100 years old, should be regarded as a site of cultural heritage, even though it is not a declared monument.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is “odd” that the environmental review concluded that the immediate impact of building on the old golf course was “undetermined” when there would be direct changes and heritage would be destroyed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government took back 32 hectares of the golf course last year, with a plan to build public housing flats on nine hectares of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Court last year suspended the environmental review on an interim basis so the site could be preserved pending this hearing which is set to continue on Friday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Thursday said his government's efforts to improve people's lives had fallen short, conceding his ruling party's crushing election defeat last month reflected voters' assessment of his two years in office.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his first press conference in 21 months, Yoon pledged to focus on improving the economy and tackling what he called the national emergency of flagging birth rates over the three years he has left in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3 percent in the first three months of this year, but living costs have remained stubbornly high, despite some progress in tackling inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a new policy push, a government ministry would be set up to tackle the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque reading "The Buck Stops Here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, maintained its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising kids as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department on Thursday ordered contractors linked to a fatal accident at the Kai Tak Sports Park to suspend the use of an elevating work platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the construction worker, 52, was trapped between the platform and a metal structure as he was inspecting on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said officials immediately started an on-site investigation once they were notified about the accident, and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned to suspend the use of the platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The contractors cannot resume the work until the department is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added it would complete a probe into the case as soon as possible, find out if any party was liable and take legal actions if necessary, while recommending improvement measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was saddened by the death and expressed its deepest sympathy to his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The worker was found unconscious on Wednesday morning and was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.

    HK to host global aviation route event next year

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will welcome thousands of civil aviation leaders next year to explore business possibilities and open new air routes to the SAR, as the city prepares to host a major global airline route convention for the first time in September 2025.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The event - Routes World 2025 - will be organised by the Airport Authority, in collaboration with Routes, which operates global airline and airport networking events and conferences, with a particular focus on world aviation routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a signing ceremony to mark the collaboration, Steven Small, Director of Events at Routes, expects the event will attract attendees from 150 countries and 250 airlines who seek to expand their global airline route networks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These, he noted, could bring significant economic benefits to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A typical Routes World event can exceed over US$590 million of economic impact over a three to five year period. That only can take place if it’s part of a strategic plan of growth, and Hong Kong is a fantastic example of that strategic plan,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Its location, superb infrastructure, and exciting tourism offerings means that Hong Kong international airport is already recognised as one of the best international aviation hubs globally,” Small added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Vivian Cheung, chief operating officer of the Airport Authority, noted the timing of this event is very "ideal" as the city is expected to complete the third runway expansion project by the end of this year, which will enable the city’s airport to serve 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition, we are progressing at full speed with the development of what we call ‘the airport city’ to showcase attendees the city’s enormous business potential,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airport city is an area under development that would eventually comprise entertainment, retail, and dining facilities, as well as convention and exhibition venues and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also noted the authority would take the opportunity to explore the potential for opening new long-haul flights, especially to countries involved in the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to the event in 2025, the city will also host a major aviation event — the CAPA Airline Leader Summit, Asia & Sustainability Awards — in November this year.

    'Waste charging should start in August at govt venues'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Green Earth says government departments taking part in the scheme should aim to cut waste by 10 percent within a year. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752465_1_20240509160436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A green group has suggested that Hong Kong's much-delayed waste charging scheme should begin as planned on August 1, but only at government-run premises and facilities, other than public housing estates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government earlier conceded that there are still problems with the pay-as-you-throw scheme, which has been tested at 14 locations since last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an open letter to Legco's environmental affairs panel on Thursday, the Green Earth said officials should start the first phase of the scheme in August, covering government offices, parks and public schools, among other venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Participating government departments should propose clear waste reduction targets, cutting waste by 10 percent within 12 months, while disclosing the manpower expenditure and management costs of relevant premises to the public," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwin Lau, the group's founder and executive director, said the government should set an example and show the public how to reduce waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government can work out the most effective ways and the most eco-friendly ways to work on this waste charging - how to reduce waste, how to minimise the volume or weight of the waste - so that offices or residential blocks can reduce the volume of the waste, which is the main objective of the waste-charging scheme," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that public education needs to be beefed up to clarify misunderstandings about the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of the people do not really understand the reason why the government needs to enforce the waste charging law. They complained that waste recycling facilities are far away, not convenient, and they can hardly find a food waste collection facility to dispose of their food waste," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to step up public education and enhance the collection network to make it more convenient for the general public."

    Revised helper agency rules target 'job-hopping'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752463_1_20240509155512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday published a revised code of practice for employment agencies, partly to try to deter foreign domestic helpers (FDH) from "job-hopping".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move comes after complaints about helpers switching employers within a short period of time during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration regulations regarding changes of employer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said some of the changes will also better protect employers as consumers, such as requiring agencies to set out in agreements the fees for each service category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[They need to] clearly state whether a refund or arrangement for a replacement FDH will be provided where their services are not delivered in full, or the employment contract has been prematurely terminated by the FDH within the two-year contract period," the department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised code also bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said agencies will be at risk of losing their licence if they or their employees fail to follow the revised code.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students at Ireland's Trinity College Dublin (TCD) on Wednesday ended a five-day protest against Israel's actions in Gaza after they said their demands were met by the university.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on its website, the university said "an agreement was reached" after "successful talks between the university's senior management and the protesters".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the institution's student union, said TCD's statement was a "testament to grassroots student-staff power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCD said the university "will complete a divestment from investments in Israeli companies that have activities in the occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN blacklist in this regard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters had demanded the university end any relationships it had with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security staff had closed the campus gates -- which are usually open to the public -- during the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student activists began their action last Friday as a "solidarity encampment with Palestine" echoing similar protests in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pro-Palestinian protests have rocked US campuses for weeks, spreading to countries in Europe as well as Australia. (AFP)

    Hospital Authority Convention to be held next week

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said more than 7,000 medical professionals will gather at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for an annual conference next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 160 speakers will share their views on telemedicine, smart hospitals and artificial intelligence during the HA Convention on May 16 and 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Loletta So, who chairs the convention’s scientific programme committee, said this year's edition will be the largest ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the scale, it’s actually much larger than last year. I think it’s more than last year. And it’s actually the highest number of all the previous years. So it’s going to be a very big meeting for us,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We mainly focus on the core values of the HA, which is about the people-centred care, professional service, etc. Another main point is about the innovation in our healthcare. So we have something like artificial intelligence, and then we have the telehealth and smart initiatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Hospital will also report on its latest developments regarding new innovation technologies, such as using artificial intelligence to detect strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Samuel Lam, a neurosurgery consultant at the hospital, said the technology saves time for doctors because they don't have to go through image scans one by one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will help us to streamline the whole workflow. For example, when the AI software identifies those high-risk patients, then the intervention team will be alerted immediately in the fastest way," he said.

    Stock market rebound helps more IPO listings: HKEX

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports in April surged 8.4 percent – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports from the United States jumped by nine percent, while exports fell by nearly three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$72.35 billion from US$58.55 billion in March. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The friendship between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia has blossomed since SAR officials visited the Middle Eastern country two years ago, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Capital Markets Forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong and Saudi bourses, Wong said the two territories are discussing an investment promotion and protection deal and a number of organisations have signed memoranda of understanding on issues ranging from dispute avoidance and resolution to artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pointed out that the SAR provides a fundraising platform for Saudi Arabian businesses to expand, serves as a springboard to access the mainland Chinese market, and offers opportunities to allocate offshore renminbi assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong stressed that the SAR and Saudi Arabia can help each other achieve their "ambitious goals in finance and well beyond".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Saudi Arabia has clear and ambitious goals for the development of its financial markets, and it's cultivating a diversified and efficient financial sector that contributes to realising the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, meanwhile, is an international financial centre, with a highly open and internationalised market and a regulatory regime that is aligned with major overseas markets. We adopt the best practices in the world... With our advanced capital markets, Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's partner and best friend."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed that the SAR administration is considering setting up an economic and trade office in Saudi Arabia, and that Cathay Pacific will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh in the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Bonnie Chan, told the same event that the SAR and Saudi Arabia have been working closely together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKEX has been playing its role by building more connectivity between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital markets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have signed a [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Tadawul Group. We have added the Saudi exchange as one of our recognised stock exchanges. We listed the world's largest and Asia's first Saudi ETF on our markets, an important first step in enabling Hong Kong investors to get to know to the Saudi market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Minister of Investment Development in Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Khabti, said Hong Kong could be more involved in the kingdom's development, as Riyadh aims to invest US$3.2 trillion into its economy by 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One thing that's very important is I believe we don't see enough participation from the Hong Kong financial sector and the role it can play to facilitate for China and the rest of Asia, becoming part of that beautiful story we have," he said.

    Battling Brunson fires Knicks over Pacers

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752421_1_20240509114855.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana exploited Brunson's absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm's length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana's scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday were investigating a fatal accident at Kai Tak Sports Park involving a construction worker.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, 52, was found unconscious on Wednesday morning on a platform. He was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sports park officials said they have offered their condolences to the family of the man, who was an aerial work platform operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that the contractor and sub-contractor involved will provide all the help they can to the family and will cooperate with police and Labour Department investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it was the second fatal accident in less than three months involving the same contractor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the firm should thoroughly review its safety management system in order to protect the lives of its workers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lo Wai-fung has made history by becoming the territory's first taekwondo athlete to make the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He's headed to Paris this summer in the under 68kg class because an opponent he lost to in a qualifying tournament in March was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Taekwondo Association said originally, only the two athletes who made the final of the Asian qualifier would reach the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lo, 22, is now taking the spot because Ali Reza Abbasi from the Refugee Olympic Team was deemed ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the male and female tournaments have four weight categories, with 16 fighters in each weight class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic taekwondo competition begins on August 7.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Hungary on Wednesday evening, state media said, in the last leg of his European tour after visiting France and Serbia earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Broadcaster CCTV said Xi "arrived in Budapest by special plane and began his state visit to Hungary, at the invitation of Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written speech upon his arrival, Xi said China and Hungary are good friends and good partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to pay a state visit to the beautiful country of Hungary at the gracious invitation of President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban," he said, extending heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the Hungarian government and people on behalf of the government and people of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years, the two sides have seen frequent high-level exchanges, and fruitful outcomes in Belt and Road cooperation, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we have set a fine example of building a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation," he added. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Biden warns Israel US will stop weapons supply

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden says Washington will halt all weapons to Israel if it launches a full-scale invasion of Rafah. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752409_1_20240509104320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden on Wednesday publicly warned Israel for the first time that the US would stop supplying it weapons if Israeli forces make a major invasion of Rafah, a refugee-packed city in southern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American leader's comments represent his strongest public language to date in his effort to deter an Israeli assault on Rafah while underscoring a growing rift between the US and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden acknowledged US weapons had been used by Israeli forces to kill civilians in Gaza, where the Jewish state has mounted a seven-month-old offensive aimed at destroying Hamas following its October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's campaign has so far killed at least 30,000 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres," he said when asked about 2,000-pound bombs sent to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, earlier this week called Washington's decision to delay shipments "very disappointing" although he did not believe the US would stop supplying arms to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel this week attacked Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have sought refuge, but Biden said he did not consider Israel’s strikes a full-scale invasion because they have not struck “population centres.” (Reuters)

    Nuggets' Jokic scoops third NBA MVP award

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jokic's 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league this season. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752405_1_20240509100327.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic was named NBA Most valuable Player for the third time in four seasons on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Serbian star, who won the award in 2021 and 2022, finished runner-up in the voting in 2023 but had the satisfaction of leading the Nuggets to a first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in the regular season and beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Behind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season – although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018. (AFP)

    'More full-day closures likely for ageing MTR'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former MTR engineer Gary Zhang says more closures are likely. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752402_1_20240509094723.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An MTR engineer-turned-lawmaker said on Thursday that a full-day closure of the Kwun Tong line for maintenance is essential, adding that more short-term closures are likely to be required as the network ages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gary Zhang, who worked for the corporation before entering politics, made the comments on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=951319&livetime=20240509000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme a day after the MTR announced that no trains would operate on the stretch between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that the replacement work this time has to be carried out at very high levels within the tunnel. And it's very close to the train power supply system" he told RTHK's Samantha Butler:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So therefore, it's basically technically impossible to just rely on one night of non-traffic hours to complete the job."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang added that the MTR was confident of completing the work within the allotted time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was very likely that more such closures would be required as the network's oldest routes, the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines, reach the end of their design lifespan. Zhang noted that the routes opened in the 1980s and had a design life of approximately 50 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said structural work like that being carried out on July 28 was "very critical to the railway operations safety and the reliability".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Announcing the work yesterday, the MTR said July 28 was chosen because it fell on a Sunday during the summer holiday, when usage was likely to be light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the other lines running through the four affected stations would remain open, adding that a free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid showed they remain Europe's comeback kings as Joselu's late double rescued them from the brink of elimination to reach the Champions League final with a dramatic 2-1 second-leg win over Bayern Munich at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 4-3 aggregate victory sealed Real's progress to a remarkable sixth Champions League final in 10 years and they will bid for a record-extending 15th title against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a repeat of their spectacular semi-final comeback win over Manchester City two years ago, they saw their opponents take the lead after Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies fired home a stunning strike from a counter attack in the 68th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Joselu climbed off the bench to equalise following a calamitous error from Manuel Neuer in the 88th minute and, two minutes later, he shinned a second into the Bayern goal from a cross by Antonio Ruediger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The effort was first ruled out for an apparent offside, but the goal was given following a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die," Jude Bellingham, who will play against his former club in the final, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Davies opened the scoring in spectacular fashion, cutting back on his right foot and curling an unstoppable bullet of a shot into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Real, who had dominated proceedings, piled on the pressure with Vinicius Jr tormenting the visitors down the left channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazilian glided past Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Kimmich effortlessly and created a number chances for himself and his team mates, who were denied several times by an inspired Neuer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bayern keeper looked on course to be man of the match as he weathered a storm, but with minutes remaining he fumbled a Vinicius strike from the edge of the box to gift Joselu the equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goal recharged a raucous Santiago Bernabeu under their spectacular new roof and two minutes later Real worked their European magic again, snatching a deserved winner that fired the Spanish giants into another final. (Reuters)

    US stocks mixed as earnings season winds down

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, digesting another round of mixed earnings in a quarter that has seen solid but unspectacular corporate results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think that companies did a nice job of outpacing their Q1 expectations. But I did notice that earnings estimates for the year for 2024 really haven't changed much," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that companies aren't reporting "much earnings growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.4 percent at 39,056.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was flat at 5,187, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,302.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks finished little changed on Tuesday after three up days in which markets embraced Federal Reserve comments that further interest rate hikes were unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A handful of prominent earnings reports have commanded focus in a week with few major economic reports following last week's heavy calendar that included April jobs data and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Uber dropped 5.7 percent after reporting a US$654 million loss, while rival ride-hailing company Lyft jumped 7.1 percent after topping estimates, saying it sees solid demand growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also higher was Reddit, which advanced 3.9 percent as it posted a 48 percent jump in revenues to US$243 million. The social media company said higher costs were driven by expenses for its initial public offering. (AFP)

    Olympic flame arrives on French soil for Paris Games

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French rapper Jul lights the Olympic and Paralympic Torch Relays cauldron. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752374_1_20240509023403.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Olympic flame arrived on French soil on Wednesday at the port of Marseille on board a 19th century ship in front of 150,000 spectators for a ceremony that posed a first major test for organisers ahead of the 2024 Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Florent Manaudou carried the torch from the deck of the Belem, a three-masted vessel which had transported it from Greece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manaudou passed the torch to Paralympic champion sprinter Nantenin Keita, who handed it to French rapper Jul to light a cauldron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Belem entered Marseille's Old Port surrounded by hundreds of small boats, planes from the Patrouille de France display team swooped overhead tracing the Olympic rings in the sky before they returned to paint the red, white and blue of the French flag in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fireworks also tore into the sky as the Belem docked after its 12-day voyage from Greece, where the flame was lit in Olympia on April 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrival of the flame marks the start of a 12,000-kilometre torch relay across France and its far-flung overseas territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers are hoping the first public spectacle of the Games on French soil – just 79 days from an opening ceremony that will take place on the river Seine – will help build excitement after a row about ticket prices and concerns about security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's something we've been waiting for for a very long time," chief organiser Tony Estanguet said on Monday, referring to the 100 years since Paris last staged the Games. "The Games are coming home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, which was also the host in 1900, sees itself at the heart of the modern Olympic movement after a French aristocrat, Pierre de Coubertin, revived the idea of the Games as practised by the Greeks until the 4th century BC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Covid-hit edition in Tokyo in 2021 and the corruption-tainted Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, the Paris Olympics are seen as an important moment for the sporting extravaganza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the background in Marseille, around 6,000 security forces are on duty at a time when the country is on its highest terror alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other stars to take part in the parade, which continues in Marseille on Thursday, include NBA-winning basketball player Tony Parker and Ivory Coast football great Didier Drogba.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extremely tight security will be a constant feature as the torch travels through more than 450 French towns and cities, and passes by dozens of tourist attractions including the Mont Saint Michel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 200 members of the security forces are set to be positioned permanently around it, including an anti-terror SWAT team and anti-drone operatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has referred to the risk of protests, including from far-left groups or environmental activists such as Extinction Rebellion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers have promised a "spectacular" and "iconic" Olympics, with much of the sport set to take place in temporary venues around the City of Light including at the Eiffel Tower and the Invalides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the absence of a much-feared security scare, the opening ceremony will take place in boats on the river Seine in a radical departure from past Games which have opened in the main stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of the major infrastructure has been completed with only two new permanent sporting venues built in a bid to reduce the financial cost and carbon emissions of the global extravaganza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The idea of the torch rally harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will run from July 26-August 11, followed by the Paralympics from August 28-September 8. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from devastating floods that have ravaged southern Brazil for days reached 100 on Wednesday, authorities said, as the search continued for dozens of people still missing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with hundreds of people injured and 160,000 forced from their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have no access to drinking water or electricity – or even the means to call for help with telephone and internet services down in many places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as "the emergency is continuing to develop" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats, and even jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people are loathe to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Contaminated water can transmit diseases," civil defence spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Confederation of Municipalities said nearly 100,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at about 4.6 billion reais (more than US$900 million.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Porto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at risk of rupturing. (AFP)

    FTX says customers will be repaid for losses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customers of failed cryptocurrency platform FTX will be made whole on the assets they lost when the company collapsed in 2022, it announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plan "contemplates the centralised distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022," said a statement released by FTX Trading LTD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total distributions to customers will be between US$14.5-US$16.3 billion. FTX said the plan still must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors," said John Ray III, chief executive and chief restructurings officer of FTX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX said it garnered the funds "by monetising an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets," mostly investments held by the company and affiliates and litigation claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another factor was the resolution of claims against the firm, including some US$24 billion that had been sought by the Internal Revenue Service for the period prior to the Chapter 11 filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To resolve the IRS cases, FTX will instead pay US$200 million in cash and US$685 million to be paid out after other claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan also will pay out interest of up to nine percent, FTX said. What won't be included will be the appreciation in value that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed since November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX collapsed suddenly following a deluge of customer withdrawals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's chief architect, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison following a conviction of fraud and other financial crimes. (AFP)

    'South Gaza hospitals have only three days' fuel left'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This Palestinian boy faces a long wait for treatment at the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752368_1_20240509003721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have only three days of fuel left, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday, due to closed border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite international objections, Israel sent tanks into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and seized the nearby crossing into Egypt that is the main conduit for aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The closure of the border crossing continues to prevent the UN from bringing fuel. Without fuel all humanitarian operations will stop. Border closures are also impeding delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tedros said Al-Najjar, one of the three hospitals in Rafah, was no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in the vicinity and the military operation in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At a time when fragile humanitarian operations urgently require expansion, the Rafah military operation is further limiting our ability to reach thousands of people who have been living in dire conditions without adequate food, sanitation, health services and security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This must stop now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geneva-based WHO is the UN's health agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel bombarded Rafah on Wednesday as talks resumed in Cairo aimed at agreeing the terms of a truce in the seven-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed more than 34,800 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Revamp involving railway police aims to boost policing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they are integrating some 300 police officers in the Railway District into five land regions from the middle of this month, in a bid to improve operation efficiency and anti-terrorism efforts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After a one-month trial period, officers from the land regions will take over the duties of railway police, including daily patrols and response to railway incidents, in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 1985, the Railway District is responsible for maintaining law and order in the railway system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephen Yu, a district commander of the Railway District, said their work was affected by problems such as MTR service disruptions in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see the challenge and we encounter challenges in that by relying solely on the MTR trains as our only means of transportation to respond to rail incidents is difficult and that would hinder our professional response. The public definitely would like to see their reports to be dealt with promptly and timely," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, if there's an incident happening in one of the MTR stations, our officers will encounter problems and difficulty to get to the scene of the incident because of the suspension of the train service. Now, what we think is it would be much easier and it would be much more timely for the officers from the service side to respond. Now, that includes the emergency unit, police tactical unit, and the patrol unit of the service formation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the revamp, the railway police will be overseen by the police headquarters, instead of the Kowloon East regional headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The operations wing’s chief superintendent, Pierre Wong, said it does not mean that the long-standing Railway District is being “dissolved”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't use the word of dissolving the rail district. What I will use is the enhancement of the policing project because the railway district will subsequently come under the command of the operations wing of the police headquarters. So you can't say it's not existing. It will continue to exist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our focus is to, through the operation deployment arrangement, enhance the overall capability of our officers. That is our objective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they will also combine the railway response team and the counter-terrorism response unit to beef up counter-terrorism efforts.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said it firmly opposes the US withdrawing export licences to telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, as it also vowed to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The remarks came after the US Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has revoked some export licences related to Huawei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, a Reuters report, citing sources, noted that the US government has withdrawn special licences that allows chip suppliers Qualcomm and Intel to sell order-generation semiconductors to Huawei for use in its laptops and handsets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing called the move by Washington “a typical practice of economic coercion” and a “violation to its commitment to not decouple from China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The US has generalised the concept of national security, politicised economic and trade issues, abused export control measures, and repeatedly imposed unreasonable sanctions and repression on specific Chinese firms. China is firmly opposed to this,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in response to media inquiry on the reported cancellation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It not only violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but also severely harms the interests of US companies. What the US has done has significantly violated its commitment,” the spokesperson added, citing that these actions are also in stark contrast to the US claim of “precisely defining national security”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei did not immediately comment on the decision by the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancellations came after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro, powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra9 processor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid spying concerns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University in Washington DC on Wednesday and arrested demonstrators, hours after dozens marched to the home of the school’s president as city officials prepared to appear before Congress on the protest’s handling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith were called to testify on Wednesday afternoon at the Republican-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, but the hearing was cancelled after the arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States, and increasingly in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges cracked down immediately. Others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District of Columbia police said officers moved to disperse demonstrators because “there has been a gradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.” It said 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Some protesters were pepper sprayed as police blocked them from the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George Washington University had warned of possible suspensions for continuing the camp on University Yard. Protesters carrying signs that read, “Free Palestine” and “Hands off Rafah,” also marched to school President Ellen Granberg’s home on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While the university is committed to protecting students’ rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,” a school statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, police detained 86 people following an operation to remove students staging a pro-Palestinian occupation at the Sorbonne university in Paris, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested in the police operation on Tuesday night were being held for a variety of public order offences, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include wilful damage, rebellion, violence against a person holding public authority, intrusion into an education establishment and holding a meeting designed to disrupt order. Some are also being held for participation in a group with a view to preparing violence or damage to property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before police moved in, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said there would never be a right to disrupt France's universities with such protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, pro-Palestinian protesters built barricades at the University of Amsterdam, using desks and railings to block off the canalside entrance in the heart of the city as they vowed to stay put until the institution severs all ties with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riot police used a bulldozer to knock down barricades at another University of Amsterdam site on Tuesday and detained 169 people, but said the university had not yet asked for similar intervention on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Lam says the injunction is not meant to restrict the normal operation of internet service providers. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752353_1_20240508203331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam said the government will ask internet service providers to remove the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong", adding that such a move will not hinder normal journalistic and academic activities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the ruling is not meant to target tech giants such as Google or Meta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the effect is to persuade the internet service provider not to provide the convenience and not to facilitate the commission of unlawful act. And that also makes it crystal clear that the injunction is not aiming at restricting the normal operation of any internet service provider," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Free flow of information is of crucial importance to Hong Kong. This is a core value that we will do our best to maintain and preserve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee also welcomed the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, he wrote that the injunction safeguards national security and the dignity of the national anthem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the song was used to incite acts endangering national security and "Hong Kong independence", causing harm to both the SAR and the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In banning the song, the Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling last year, with the three judges agreeing with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam added that the court ruling will not lead to unreasonable restrictions on freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Court of Appeal actually conducts the well-known proportionality test to consider whether a grant of injunction would in fact lead to any disproportional or unreasonable restriction on the freedom of expression," the secretary for justice said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But after conducting that proportionality analysis, the court came to the conclusion that in all the circumstances, the injunction would not constitute any unreasonable restriction on freedom of expression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that “preventing anyone from using or disseminating the relevant song with the intention of inciting secession and insulting the national anthem is a legitimate and necessary measure by the SAR government to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security”.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Presidents Xi Jinping and Aleksandar Vucic shake hands in a signing ceremony in Belgrade. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752350_1_20240508194909.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that a free trade agreement between China and Serbia will take effect on July 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is one of six measures announced by the president to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he met the press with his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, after they held talks in Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbia is the first European country to build such a community with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures announced by Xi, there will be more direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai and airlines will be encouraged to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou, and China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realise the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples," Xi said in a joint press conference with Vucic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vucic called Xi an “ironclad” friend and said his visit to Serbia is “historic” because it opens the path for even closer ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, the two countries said they decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday night on the second leg of his European tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes on the anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 1999 during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself," Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Maintenance work to close four MTR stations on July 28

<img alt="Passengers can still take the Tsuen Wan and Tuen Ma lines. Photo: MTR" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752330_2_20240508171958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Wednesday said it would close a major stretch of the Kwun Tong Line for a rare, full-day maintenance operation later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There will be no service between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on Sunday, July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, said all four stations affected would still be served by either the Tsuen Wan or Tuen Ma lines, while free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the asset renewal work would be completed in time for people to get to work on the following Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the reason why we chose the 28th of July is because it is in the middle of the summer holiday. We believe that quite a number of citizens will be on holiday on that day, and that students also have no school on that day. We are trying to minimise the impact to the passengers and also to the citizens in the town," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KH Lee, chief of the corporation's operations engineering maintenance, said they would replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station, adding the work was necessary based on asset condition and life cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are lots of complexity not only because of the preparation of those safety precautions, but also all the work associated with this sort of hangar replacement, like in the course of the hangar replacement, we have to relocate and dismantle some of the existing overhead line and also their parts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Upon completion of the work, we have also arranged tests to ensure every system is in good order before we resume the service, so there's a reason why we have decided to have a one-day closure together with the two non-traffic hours.That means before and after to complete the work in one go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added several stations would need to carry out similar tunnel facility renewal projects in the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people RTHK spoke to said repair work was inevitable for maintaining efficient railway services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There needs to be maintenance from time to time as facilities start to age, or there will be more signal failures in the future. That would lead to longer waiting times, which is very troublesome for people," said a man surnamed Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man named Tsoi said he would leave earlier than his usual time when using the train that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman named Lam said she is a bit worried that there will be huge crowds while travelling that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It could be quite disruptive to people especially since they are working during travelling hours at some of the busiest stations," she said.

    Court grants injunction over 'Glory to Hong Kong'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted a temporary injunction order banning the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their decision, judges Jeremy Poon, Carlye Chu and Anthea Pang said they agreed with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said criminal law alone could not achieve the purpose of safeguarding national security regarding the matter, since it is not practicable to bring proceedings against "unidentifiable" people online who commit offences in relation to the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that there had been "widespread and persistent" flouting of the law before and especially after the national security law came into force in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such is the seriousness of the criminal problems that the court must intervene immediately to prevent the continuation of the prevailing unlawful state of affairs; otherwise any further damage to national security would likely to be irreparable," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said the injunction was necessary to persuade internet platforms to remove "problematic" content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They agreed with a lower court ruling earlier that the injunction may have “chilling effects”, but said it has addressed concerns about the right to free expression by allowing exceptions for lawful action connected to the song, such as academic and reporting activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lower court had last year rejected the government's bid for an injunction, saying it would be "of no real utility". The Department of Justice appealed against that ruling.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)

 Labour minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said professionals who came to Hong Kong through a new admission scheme have created billions of dollars of economic output.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the second day of a talent summit in Wan Chai, Sun said the government recently conducted a study to see how they are doing in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We estimate that the more than 30,000 people who had arrived here through the Top Talent Pass Scheme in 2023 can bring in about HK$34 billion of direct economic contribution to Hong Kong a year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This means they help boost our GDP by around 1.2 percent a year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said many of these professionals moved to the SAR with their young families - with two-thirds of them being under 40 - and helped rejuvenate the city’s ageing society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said a memorandum of understanding newly signed between the 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) would help expats settle in the GBA.
