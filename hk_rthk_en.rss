<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia athlete Annie Cheung on Monday added a silver medal for Hong Kong, China in the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant, 25, was defeated by China's Lin Ximei 5-1 in the women's individual BC4 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin scored a point in each of the first two ends for a 2-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third end, a series of miscues by Cheung widened the gap, with Lin scoring three more times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung picked up one point in the final and fourth end but it was not enough to overcome the deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's victory in the final avenged her loss to Cheung in their inaugural pool match in the preliminary round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not very satisfied with my overall performance, especially in the final. I was too nervous, so I wasn't playing as freely as I should. But I am still very happy to be able to win a silver medal," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I try to regroup as quickly as possible... and I hope to achieve good results in the mixed pairs event."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will compete in the boccia's mixed pairs event alongside six-time Paralympian Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Cheung on winning the silver medal, praising her for staying resilient against the world's best athletes throughout the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, SAR table tennis player Leung Chung-yan ended his Paralympic debut when he was beaten in the last 16 of the men's MS-11 singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost 6-11, 11-8, 6-11 and 6-11 to Peter Palos of Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team have now captured one gold, two silvers and a bronze at the Paris Paralympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia player John Loung on Monday won Hong Kong's first gold medal in the Paris Paralympics, bowling his way to victory in the men's individual BC1 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Loung, who is competing in his fourth Paralympics, beat Jung Sung-joon of South Korea 4-1 to reach the top of the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete went ahead by scoring two points in end one, and then added an extra point in each of the next two ends, before Jung responded with a point in the final end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung cheered and waved to the crowd after his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on behalf of Loung after the match, his coach Marco Lau said the athlete did not think it was possible to reach the final, let alone win a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung also paid tribute to his coaches as well as veteran boccia star Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to our head coach, Kwok [Hart-wing], and other coaches who have helped me a lot. And also, thank you to Leung Yuk-wing, for assisting his teammates quite a bit in their training," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Loung on winning gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "John Loung demonstrated unwavering determination and superb skills in the competition, claiming the first gold medal for the Hong Kong, China Delegation at this year's Paralympic Games," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His gold medal is well-deserved. All Hong Kong people and I are thrilled and proud of his outstanding performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR has won three medals at the Paralympics so far, which include a silver and bronze in swimming.

    New World shares slump on profit warning

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New World Development's share price plunged to a 21-year low on the back of its expected net loss of HK$20 billion. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768743_2_20240902181343.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of New World Development, one of Hong Kong's major property developers, ended the day nearly 13 percent lower after it estimated a net loss of as much as HK$20 billion for the financial year ending in June.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shares fell to HK$6.74 in early trading, marking a 21-year low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finished the day at HK$6.83.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said in a Friday filing it expected a drop of as much as 23 percent in core operating profit from continuing operations due to a lack of revenue and it would have fair value and impairment losses of as much as HK$9.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with the continuous interest rate hikes experienced during the year as well as the depreciation of renminbi, the group expects to record a net loss," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company also said the provisions were one-off non-cash and unrealised items and did not affect the group's cash flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New World has one of the highest debt-to-equity ratios among Hong Kong's property developers and its de-leveraging plan has been closely watched over the past year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Hong Kong has not seen any major defaults by its property developers, like in China, investors worry about weakening liquidity for the sector due to sluggish residential and commercial property markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New World's full-year loss estimate follows a first-half net loss of HK$5.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JPMorgan analysts said in a note to clients that New World's loss "is not as drastic as the headline suggests", because its pro-forma core net loss may only be HK$2-3 billion if non-cash items like the impairment loss and losses on asset sales are excluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The net loss situation is more a status quo. For New World Development, the more important consideration is not earnings, but the balance sheet and refinancing ability," JPMorgan said, adding the developer secured HK$16 billion in loan arrangements in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New World is expected to report its earnings later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its stock has slid some 80 percent since its peak in mid-2021, just before the debt crisis in China's property sector began to emerge. It currently has a market cap of around HK$17.15 billion. (Reuters)

    SAR primed for new productive forces: Beijing official

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Beijing official in Hong Kong on Monday said the SAR is the most suitable place to develop new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a summit, Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, said talent is key, as he hailed Hong Kong's top-notch research and development teams, as well as its convenient global connections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre. Finance and innovation and technology are intertwined, and Hong Kong has incubated more than 4,200 start-ups. It is a petrol station for the development of new quality productive forces," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has unique and unparalleled conditions to develop new quality productive forces."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng also brought up "tourism is everywhere", a concept suggested by Xia Baolong, the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trade should think about how to make good use of the beautiful 1,180 kilometres of coastline and 263 islands, how to support Hong Kong's tourism with animation, performing arts, e-sports, healthcare, artificial intelligence and coastal sports, and how to provide a top destination for leisure and vacation for the more than 500 million middle- and high-class people on the mainland," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, at the same event, vowed to speed up the development of new quality productive forces and said overseas talent will be a focus for the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government is fully committed to providing broader space for entrepreneurship and employment for talents in innovation and technology, encouraging industry and academia to work together to cultivate them, and to offer them richer practical opportunities," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we continue to improve our talent schemes to attract more global talent and to become a place for high-end international talent to gather."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a newspaper interview, Lee said those who came to Hong Kong via various talent schemes generally earn more than the median monthly income.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Liberal Party on Monday called on the government to provide the TV rights for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles for free to major broadcasters in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party surveyed 1,047 people, with around 70 percent of them backing the idea of the government buying the official rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities secured the television rights for the Paris Olympics, enabling live broadcasts on four free-to-air television channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Southern District Councillor Jonathan Leung, who is also from the Liberal Party, said the free broadcasting rights had ignited an Olympic fervour across the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said the government should ensure that people in Hong Kong could watch the Los Angeles Games for free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This Olympics, we can see that the media tried so hard to broadcast, to show our citizens how good this Olympics is. I believe they all benefited from the free broadcasting this year," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they would [be] happy to see the government purchase the next Olympics broadcasting [rights], and they would share the benefit. I think it's good for all of us - the television, the media, and the citizens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to concerns over the remuneration local athletes receive, Leung called on businesses to offer more sponsorship and job opportunities to athletes.

    Mass strike brings disruptions to Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters stand around a fire on a highway during an anti-government rally in Tel Aviv calling for the release of Israeli hostages. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768725_1_20240902161400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rare call for a general strike in Israel to protest the failure to return hostages held in Gaza led to closures and other disruptions around the country on Monday, including at its main international airport. But it was ignored in some areas, reflecting deep political divisions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of Israelis had poured into the streets late Sunday in grief and anger after six hostages were found dead in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The families and much of the public blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying they could have been returned alive in a deal with Hamas to end the nearly 11-month-old war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But others support Netanyahu's strategy of maintaining relentless military pressure on Hamas, whose October 7 attack into Israel triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say it will eventually force the militants to give in to Israeli demands, potentially lead to more successful rescues and ultimately annihilate the group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, called for a general strike for Monday, the first since the start of the war. It aims to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking, health care and the country’s main airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airlines at Israel’s main international airport Ben-Gurion were halting outgoing flights between 8 and 10am. Those flights either departed early or were slightly delayed, and travellers were seen lining up at check-in counters despite the limited disruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arriving flights were continuing as usual during that time, according to the Israel Airports Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks, some large malls and government offices were all closed due to the strike and public transit was limited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Municipalities in Israel’s populated central area, including Tel Aviv, were participating in the strike, leading to shortened school hours and cancellations for public daycares and kindergartens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many municipalities, however, including Jerusalem, were not participating in the strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli media reported that the state appealed to a labour court to cancel the strike, saying it was politically motivated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations on Sunday appeared to be the largest since the start of the war, with organisers estimating that up to 500,000 people joined nationwide events and the main rally held in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli media estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 took part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are demanding that Netanyahu reach a deal to return the remaining roughly 100 hostages held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, even if it means leaving a battered Hamas intact and withdrawing from the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Israelis support this position, but others prioritise the destruction of the militant group over freedom for the hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has pledged “total victory” over Hamas and blames it for the failure of the negotiations, which have dragged on for much of this year. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A green turtle that was rescued in 2022 was released back into the sea on Monday, according to a spokesman from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The turtle had been under the care of Ocean Park Hong Kong (OPHK) since it was rescued by AFCD staff from waters near Chi Ma Wan Peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The green turtle weighs around 39 kilogrammes, and its carapace length measures about 66 centimetres. It was assessed by the veterinarians of OPHK as being in good condition and ready to return to the sea," an AFCD spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department is thankful to the veterinarians and staff of OPHK for taking care of it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers released the green turtle in the southern waters of Hong Kong, adding that a microchip, tag and satellite transmitter have been attached to it for future identification, and for tracking its movements and feeding grounds for conservation purposes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green turtles are a globally endangered species and the only sea turtle known to nest locally.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Monday said that public housing tenants would soon be able to enjoy a better living environment that is more age-friendly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as the Housing Bureau and Housing Authority offered a glimpse on their well-being design guide for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team came up with eight concepts - health and vitality; green living and sustainability; age-friendly; inter-generational and inclusive living; family and community connection; urban connectivity; upward mobility; perception and image - after visiting 26 housing estates across 17 districts to seek the views of over 3,000 residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, under the inter-generational and inclusive living concept, a special area would be set up for vehicles such as medical vans, allowing residents easy access to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It may not just serve the elderly persons, although sometimes the health-related mobile services may relate to the elderly persons more, but there are also mobile libraries which the children and young mothers would be very interested in," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other facilities to improve the living environment include items such as exercise stations at convenient locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also gave an example on how a facility could achieve age inclusivity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Very usually, we see the grandparents bring their grandchildren to the playground. So if the grandchildren were playing, where should the grandparents sit?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Can they sit comfortably under the tree when they watch the children play, and at the same time, can the grandparents can have a social chat to share necessary information? That is the kind of environment we want to create,” Ho added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pilot programme will be launched at five existing estates - Kai Yip Estate, Fu Shan Estate, Chak On Estate, Shui Pin Wai Estate, and Mei Lam Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is believed that Hin Fat Estate and Yip Wong Road Phase 2 (Yip Wong Estate) will be the first two projects built under the new guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho hopes consultants and designers can better utilise these guidelines, saying that those who do so will have a higher chance of being awarded the bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The details of the guidelines will be unveiled next Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calvin Au, a researcher at the think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation, welcomes the introduction of the design guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au told RTHK that the authorities have to design public housing based on the needs of residents there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different people have different needs. The challenges would be how to pick the right design recommendation from the guide to apply to the right estate," he explained
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the architect and policymakers, they really have to have a good sense of what is the population they are planning to serve, the data, so they know about the population mix and they know what they need."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The well-being design guide was proposed in Chief Executive John Lee’s maiden policy address back in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen reached the US Open quarter-finals for a second time with victory over Donna Vekic in a record late finish for a women's match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The encounter finished at 2:15am New York time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventh-seed Zheng won 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-2 against her 24th-ranked Croatian opponent who she also defeated in the Paris Olympics final four weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng will face Aryna Sabalenka next in what will be an Australian Open final rematch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At two o' clock in the morning, this is unbelievable. Thank you to the fans for not sleeping tonight and supporting me here," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donna is really tough to play in hard court. She put me in a lot of pressure. In France I was totally in control but today she hit really aggressive, it was really tough but a nice victory for me and I enjoyed it." (Agencies)

    More missile attacks on Ukraine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia pounded Ukraine's capital of Kyiv with missiles on Monday, while officials said falling debris from the downed weapons injured at least two people, sparking fires and damaging homes and infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's air defence units destroyed more than 10 cruise missiles and nearly 10 ballistic missiles, Kyiv's military administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air raid alerts went out across Ukraine for nearly two hours before the air force declared the skies clear. Neighbouring NATO member Poland activated Polish and allied aircraft to keep its airspace safe during the attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boiler house at a Kyiv water plant was partially damaged as was the entrance to a metro station doubling as a bomb shelter in the Svyatoshynksyi district, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app, though the station still operates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The district is home to a cluster of universities and schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency services also went to the districts of Svyatoshynksyi, Holosiivskyi, and Solomyanskyi, where debris fell from destroyed missiles, Klitschko added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solomyanskyi is home to a major train station and Kyiv's main airport. The historic neighbourhood of Svyatoshynksyi is on the city's western edge, while Holosiivskyi is in its southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came exactly a week after Moscow launched more than 200 missiles and drones on Ukraine, killing seven people and striking energy facilities nationwide in what Kyiv called the war's "most massive" attack. (Reuters)

    Mixed feelings on first day back at school

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong pupils on Monday had mixed feelings about going back to school, with some happy to see their old friends again and others saying they wished the summer holiday was longer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I slept at around 9.30 last night because I was playing with my dad. [I miss the holiday] because I still want to play," said one pupil studying at a Tin Shui Wai school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another pupil said she was nervous because there would be many new faces in class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Education Secretary Christine Choi wished pupils a good start to the academic year, and highlighted the need for mental health support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said as of July, more than 420 schools had signed up for the government's 4Rs Mental Health Charter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 4Rs stand for rest, relaxation, relationship and resilience, and the charter is designed to address the plight of students struggling with their mental well-being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know some schools have their own mental health support programmes for students in progress or in future," she told reporters at a secondary school in Tuen Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that as those plans are gradually integrated, more and more schools will participate in the 4Rs mental health charter, to encourage students to rest and relax, improve their resilience, and establish good interpersonal relationships."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau has sent six advisory letters to follow up on a primary pupil who has reportedly been absent from school for more than two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the bureau hopes to help the pupil get back to school as soon as possible by getting in touch with different stakeholders.

 The observatory on Monday said it might issue the Standby Signal No.1 between Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night, with Tropical Cyclone Yagi intensifying into a severe tropical storm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said Yagi would be within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong on Tuesday and then edge close to the coast of southern China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added there was a high chance Yagi would move towards the vicinity of the western part of Guangdong and Hainan Island and would further intensify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the observatory forecast Yagi could strengthen to a typhoon by Thursday.

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768686_1_20240902110322.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A far-right party won a state election for the first time in post-World War II Germany on Sunday and looked set to finish a very close second to mainstream conservatives in a second vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A new party founded by a prominent leftist also made a strong impact, while the parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular national government obtained extremely weak results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 32.8 percent of the vote in Thuringia in the country's east — well ahead of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main national opposition party, with 23.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Saxony, projections put support for the CDU, which has led the state since German reunification in 1990, at 31.9 percent and AfD on 30.6-30.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AfD made substantial gains in Thuringia and smaller ones in Saxony compared with the last state elections in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An openly right-wing extremist party has become the strongest force in a state parliament for the first time since 1949, and that causes many people very deep concern and fear,” said Omid Nouripour, a leader of the Greens, one of the national governing parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parties say they won't put AfD in power by joining it in a coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, its strength is likely to make it extremely difficult to form new state governments, forcing other parties into exotic new coalitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a historic success for us,” Alice Weidel, a national co-leader of AfD, told Germany media. She described the result as a “requiem” for Scholz's coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CDU's national general secretary, Carsten Linnemann, said that “voters in both states knew that we wouldn't form a coalition with AfD, and it will stay that way — we are very, very clear on this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weidel denounced that as “pure ignorance” and said that “voters want AfD to participate in a government.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deep discontent with a national government notorious for infighting, anti-immigration sentiment and scepticism toward German military aid for Ukraine were among the factors that have contributed to support for populist parties in the region, which is less prosperous than western Germany. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index fell 126.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to open at 17,862.59 points on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as investors in the US have reportedly been switching from tech stocks, following results from tech giant Nvidia, into shares more likely to benefit from this month's expected interest rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected to kick off a rate-cutting cycle at its monetary policy meeting on September 17-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the Hong Kong dollar pegged to the US dollar, any interest cut in the US should also lead to cuts in the SAR. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and Reuters)

  Ng returned to the pool one night after finishing sixth in the women's SM6 200 metres individual medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant was second at the halfway mark of the SB6 100 metres breaststroke final, before being leapfrogged by China's world-record holder, Liu Daomin, towards the end.
  <br/>

  Ng touched the wall at 1:34.15, nearly two seconds behind Liu for bronze, while Britain's Maisie Summers-Newton retained her gold.

    <br/>
    Debutant Annie Cheung also breezed her way to the gold medal match, after beating her Malaysian rival 7-0 in the women's individual BC4.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot passed his first major examination as Liverpool manager with a statement 3-0 win at Manchester United thanks to Luis Diaz's double and a Mohamed Salah strike on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slot has the unenviable task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp but has made a perfect start with a 100 percent record from three Premier League games to sit alongside Manchester City at the top of the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everything you want to see as a manager you saw in this game," said Slot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second consecutive defeat leaves United boss Erik ten Hag already under pressure just three games into the new season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman survived an internal review at the end of last season after overseeing the club's worst ever Premier League finish of eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But all the hallmarks of United's failings last season were exposed by the impressive visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not like I'm Harry Potter," said Ten Hag."We just had a third game in the season and again we have to build a new team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be fine," he added. "It's clear we have to improve but at the end of the season I'm quite confident that we will have a big chance to lift another trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Liverpool's ascendency over United during Klopp's reign, the German managed to win only two of his 11 away games against United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time Liverpool were ruthless and could easily have matched their record 5-0 victory away to United in 2021. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Coco Gauff was knocked out of the US Open in the fourth round on Sunday by American compatriot Emma Navarro after a serving horror show.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 13th-seeded Navarro took advantage of third-ranked Gauff's 19 double faults and 60 unforced errors to win 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 and set up a quarter-final against Spain's Paula Badosa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not the summer that I want," said Gauff who exited Wimbledon in the fourth round and suffered early losses at the Olympics, Toronto and Cincinnati.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I feel like there's 70 other players in the draw that would love to have the summer that I had even though it's probably my least well done during this time of the year," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff's defeat means that Serena Williams remains the last woman to successfully defend the US Open title back in 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Navarro had defeated Gauff at Wimbledon in July and was dominant again on Sunday from the outset. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patients will be able to pick up their medications at community pharmacies from next week, the Hospital Authority (HA) has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HA launched a medication delivery service last year, allowing patients to receive their medications at home or at the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it will expand this service and allow patients to collect their medications at over 100 community pharmacies, under Mannings and Watsons, from September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Chui, chief pharmacist with the HA, said it would provide one more option for patients, and they will be able to receive professional help as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the professional, the community pharmacists, provide counselling and also drug information to patients who want more information about their medication or drug treatment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So [it's] not only for the delivery of the drugs but also providing immediate service or professional service to the patient."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the HA would look into expanding the scope to cover more pharmacies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the HA also aims to encourage Hong Kong residents to make use of primary healthcare services to reduce the workload on public hospitals and clinics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Pharmacists in the community provide information, and also professional advice on how to prevent disease, how to improve patients' health overall. I think this is a good start to let our patients make use of healthcare professionals in the community," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Grigor Dimitrov returned to the US Open quarter-finals for the first time since 2019 with a five-set triumph over Andrey Rublev on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ninth seed Dimitrov came through 6-3, 7-6 (7/3), 1-6, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a clash with either Frances Tiafoe of the United States or Alexei Popyrin, the conqueror of Novak Djokovic, for a place in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Dimitrov made the semi-finals in 2019 where he was defeated by Daniil Medvedev having stunned five-time champion Roger Federer in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was playing fairly good," said Dimitrov, the oldest player left in the men's draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But for some reason my body got tired a little bit and he wasn't going to give up the match. I had stay patient. I think the biggest thing today was my experience."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dimitrov saved 13 of 18 break points in the match and credited long-time friend and six-time women's champion Serena Williams for a helping hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She gave me a good pep talk yesterday," he said of the US tennis legend who was watching the match in Arthur Ashe Stadium. (AFP)

 Teenage swimmer Jasmine Ng clinched her first Paralympic bronze medal for Hong Kong, China, in the women’s 100m breaststroke SB6 event, becoming the youngest Hong Kong Paralympic medallist.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old touched home in a time of 1:34.15, less than three seconds behind British Maisie Summers-Newton who smashed the Paralympic record.

    Gaza parents rush to vaccinate kids against polio

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A health worker administers the Polio vaccine to a Palestinian child in Zawayda in the central Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768629_1_20240901234439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ghadir Hajji rushed to a clinic on Sunday in hopes her five children would be among the first to get vaccinated against polio, which has re-emerged in war-ravaged Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "They absolutely have to be vaccinated," she told AFP as the family waited in line for a vaccine drive announced after health officials reported last month the first case of polio in the besieged territory in a quarter of a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We received text messages from the ministry of health and we showed up right away."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was joined by thousands of other Gazans whose fear of polio, which is highly contagious and potentially fatal, despite concerns for their personal security and rumours the vaccine would not be safe or effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polio-virus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water - an increasingly common problem in Gaza with much of the territory's infrastructure destroyed by Israel in its war against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one clinic alone in Deir el-Balah nearly 2,000 children were vaccinated on Sunday, said Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency had mobile teams going from tent to tent, marking kids' thumbs with ink once they received their doses, Wateridge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first doses were administered on Saturday to an unspecified number of children in the southern city of Khan Yunis, ahead of Sunday's large-scale rollout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign aims to vaccinate more than 640,000 children in the besieged Palestinian territory, devastated by almost 11 months of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the WHO said that Israel had agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in northern, southern and central areas to facilitate vaccinations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu however, has insisted that these pauses were not amounting to any kind of ceasefire in overall fighting in Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Charles Leclerc won the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday to delight Ferrari's massed ranks of fans as Lando Norris again chipped away at struggling champion Max Verstappen's lead in the Formula One drivers' standings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Monegasque Leclerc claimed victory at Monza for the second time after winning in 2019, holding off McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Norris in a thrilling race in which Verstappen finished nearly 38 seconds off the pace in sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huge roars engulfed the stands as Leclerc took the chequered flag after holding out on a set of hard tyres he had changed in his one and only pit stop on the 16th lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of his major rivals, apart from teammate Carlos Sainz who ended up finishing fourth, pitted twice and McLaren were hoping that the Ferrari pair would do the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But instead Leclerc managed to keep his tyres in good enough condition to stay ahead and in the end finish the race comfortably in front of Piastri, who had taken the race lead early on after a daring overtake manoeuvre on Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briton Norris, who clocked the fastest lap right at the end, will be disappointed by his finish after starting on pole but he managed to chop Verstappen's championship lead to 62 points with eight races remaining as his Dutch rival's barren run continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has now failed to win any of the last six GPs after claiming the honours in seven of the first 10, and his and Red Bull's dominance of F1 looks increasingly in question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth straight world title looked a near certainty when Verstappen won in Spain back in June, but since then he has only finished on the podium twice. (AFP)

    One in five teenagers suffer depression: survey

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One in five teenagers exhibited symptoms of depression or anxiety, according to a survey released on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service, an NGO providing mental health support and counselling, interviewed 1,646 secondary pupils between last November and April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 25 percent of the respondents even displayed "medium" to "severe" levels of depression. When asked to self-evaluate, many said they felt useless, had nothing to look forward to or hated their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 37 percent of them also expressed dissatisfaction with their academic performance, while one in four felt distressed about their appearance and body shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is "concerning", according to Scarlet Poon Fung Oi, the group's assistant chief executive officer who reported the findings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, she believed the existing three-tier school-based emergency system is effective in identifying pupils with suicidal risks or high mental health needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government introduced the scheme in December last year with an aim to offer timely assistance to students going through mental health issues. The response came after multiple teenagers took their own lives in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical psychologist Jeff Kei advised teenagers to proactively seek help when needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes we tend to avoid or even suppress our emotions. This may help us navigate the world when we are stressed but in the long run, actually it may lead to more emotional problems," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think the first thing teenagers can do is to recognise and acknowledge their feelings. There are many online services or resources that can help them enhance their emotional well-being. So, don't hesitate to look for these resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the new school year begins on Monday, Kei also called on teachers and parents to offer additional support to pupils grappling with mental health issues.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday that preparations are underway at the Kai Tak Sports Park for a grand opening ceremony in the first quarter of next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his social media page, Lee said he and a number of his top officials inspected the sports park last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the main structure of the public sports ground, indoor sports centre and main stadium are almost complete, while the interior decoration and landscaping construction are still in progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the inspection, I asked the working group to ensure that the Kai Tak Sports Park is successfully completed and opened as scheduled to consolidate Hong Kong’s strategic positioning as a city of major events. At the same time, I reminded staff to pay attention to implementation details, strengthen adaptability and ensure smooth operations after the park is completed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kai Tak Sports Park will conduct different drills and trial opening activities before its official opening to allow for adjustments… it will also adjust strategies as needed to improve response efficiency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a video posted on the CE’s social media page, the main stadium will have about eight floors, with a seating capacity of 50,000. There will also be 28 concession stands and five bars, with one being amongst the longest in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said many local sports stars and artists are slated to attend the grand opening ceremony next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes that the new, state-of-the-art venue will not only drive sports development, but also generate substantial economic benefits to Hong Kong by stimulating the growth of the performing arts, tourism and other sectors.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians engaged in a dialogue with their counterparts from Macau on the second day of their visit to the gaming hub on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eight gold medallists from the Paris Games, including table tennis star Ma Long, diver Quan Hongchan, swimmer Pan Zhanle and gymnast Liu Yang, sat down for a sharing session with elite athletes from the SAR at the Olympic Sports Centre in Taipa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They discussed how to deal with pressure and injuries during the exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan, who refreshed his own 100m freestyle world record en route to victory in Paris, revealed his ambition to further improve his time and "let the world see the limit of humankind".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes then took part in a brief game of table tennis, followed by a gymnastics demonstration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a banquet at the Wynn Palace hotel on Saturday night, Macau chief executive Ho Iat-seng expressed his gratitude to the delegation, and urged teenagers to learn from the role models on how to persevere and love the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team's packed schedule continues with a gala show at the Macau East Asian Games Dome on Sunday night, before wrapping up their visit on Monday with a community event.

    Israel recovers the bodies of six hostages

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768587_1_20240901131540.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages in Gaza, including that of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, US President Joe Biden said late on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas," Biden said in a statement issued by the White House. "I am devastated and outraged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that the bodies of Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino had been brought to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial estimation, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them," military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas and its armed wing did not immediately comment on the accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 40,691 Palestinians have been killed and 94,060 injured in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since October 7, the enclave's health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war was triggered when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, clashes broke out between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters in the occupied West Bank as Israel pushed ahead with a military operation in the flashpoint city of Jenin. Hundreds of Israeli troops have been carrying out raids since Wednesday in one of their largest actions in the West Bank in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goldberg-Polin, captured at a music festival near Gaza, appeared in a video released by Hamas in late April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world," Biden said. His parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, "have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express," the president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden vowed that "Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement, "I strongly condemn Hamas’ continued brutality, and so must the entire world. Harris, the Democratic candidate running to succeed Biden, said she and he would never waver in their commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden said he was "still optimistic" about a ceasefire deal to stop the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're on the verge of having an agreement," he said. "It's time this war ended."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden added that "people are continuing to meet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think we can close the deal, they’ve all said they agree on the principles." (Reuters)

    Rapper Fatman Scoop dies after collapsing on stage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Fatman Scoop has died, his family and manager announced on Saturday, after the 53-year-old artist suffered a medical emergency while performing on stage, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of hip-hop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scoop, best known for the hit tracks "Be Faithful" and "It Takes Scoop," collapsed on stage at Hamden Town Center Park, Connecticut and was taken to hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical staff apparently attempted to administer CPR while he was still on the stage, according to a video of the incident obtained by celebrity news site TMZ. He was then carried away on a stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a post on his Instagram account, his family wrote that "it is with profound sadness and very heavy hearts that we share news of the passing of the legendary and iconic Fatman Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fatman Scoop was known to the world as the undisputed voice of the club. His music made us dance and embrace life with positivity," they wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scoop's manager Birch Michael confirmed his death on Facebook, writing: "I love you Scoop. Thank you so much for everything you gave to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hip-hop star Missy Elliott wrote on X that Scoop's "voice and energy have contributed to many songs that made the people feel happy and want to dance for over two decades. Your impact is huge and will be never be forgotten."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Radio host Shelley Wade posted a photograph of herself with Scoop, writing: "We are losing too many of our hip-hop legends too soon. Rest easy, Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scoop briefly became embroiled in a political row in Australia in 2018 when the country's then-prime minister Scott Morrison posted a clip that featured his hit "Be Faithful."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morrison, a conservative evangelical Christian, deleted the post after his critics said the entertainer's lyrics were inappropriate and unparliamentary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's quite clear that that is not a song on my playlist," he later told reporters in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The uproar prompted a response from Scoop, who tagged Morrison in an Instagram post saying: "I am humbled to have my voice rocking in the highest offices of the Australian Government!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rapper defended his lyrics: "It's a fun PARTY SONG that has no NEGATIVITY or HARM in it!!" before extending Morrison a backstage invite to a festival appearance in Australia. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong has what it takes to be a regional processing hub for Australian exports, ahead of his five-day duty visit down under.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The financial chief departed for Sydney on Sunday. He will also visit Melbourne before returning to the SAR on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said he hopes to achieve three objectives in his latest trip, with luring investment being top of his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the highlights of this visit is to meet enterprises in the fields of biomedicine, new energy and fintech, and I will promote Hong Kong's strategic advantages and hopefully get them to set up shop in the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similarly, Chan also hoped to strengthen cooperation in green technology, citing his goal to develop Hong Kong into a "green finance centre" under this year's Budget.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also noted that Hong Kong imported HK$14.8 billion worth of Australian goods last year, including fresh produce, seafood and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia is now the city's second-largest source of imported wine by value, and the largest by volume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's highly interconnected and accessible air freight network, well-developed storage facilities and efficient customs clearance have made it a cost-effective transshipment hub for high-value goods," Chan explained, adding there is potential to further boost trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from meeting local business leaders, Chan will also attend an Asia Summit organised by the Australian Financial Review, and deliver a keynote speech.

    HK needs to beef up tech investment: Sun Dong

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong still has a long way to go before it can become a Silicon Valley-style international technology hub, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said the SAR has rolled out measures to boost the sector over the past two years, noting that the target of attracting 100 I&T enterprises to the territory within five years has been achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said there’s room to further boost investment in cutting-edge technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Hong Kong] government is investing more money on frontier technologies. Last year, it spent 1.07 percent of GDP on this, which is a record for Hong Kong. However, this is still low compared to nearby regions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, the mainland spends 2.7 to 2.8 percent of its GDP on research and technology. Cities like Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai spend even more, over 5 percent of their GDP."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the government needs to consider how to make the most out of its investments given the current financial climate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech chief also highlighted the need for the SAR to enhance its role as a super connector and super value-adder to lure more global talent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities said people who're caught feeding wild pigeons will no longer get any verbal warning and will instead face immediate, on-the-spot fines of HK$5,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said pigeon feeders will face instant enforcement measures, after an amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law came into effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Amendment Ordinance has already been in effect for a month," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enforcement officers will take immediate enforcement action without prior verbal warnings upon discovering any person who is found to be illegally feeding wild animals or feral pigeons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by the Legislative Council in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has also been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD noted that officers will step up patrols across the territory, and work closely with other department to conduct joint enforcement operations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's exports rose an 11th straight month in August, but the pace of growth was weaker than the previous month and market expectations as demand for computer chips slowed, while auto sales remained sluggish.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overseas sales by Asia's fourth-largest economy rose 11.4 percent year-on-year to US$57.90 billion, trade data showed on Sunday, slowing from a gain of 13.9 percent in the previous month, which was the fastest in six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also weaker than a 13 percent increase tipped in a Reuters survey of economists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Growth in semiconductor exports slowed to a five-month low, while auto sales fell for a third consecutive month due to temporary factors, such as wage negotiations and factory suspensions to improve production lines at some firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By destination, exports to China rose at a slower pace, but growth in US-bound shipments quickened. Exports to the European Union snapped a six-month run of declines and surged 16.1 percent to a record high of US$6.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, exports are heading towards a record-high performance this year, trade minister Ahn Duk-geun said. "Growing trends are seen across major export markets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports rose 6.0 percent in August to US$54.07 billion, after a 10.5 percent jump in July, which was the steepest since September 2022. It was slightly lower than a gain of 6.3 percent expected by economists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, the country posted a trade surplus of US$3.83 billion in August, wider than the previous month's US$3.60 billion. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A mural of Oasis stars Noel and Liam Gallagher in the Manchester suburb of Burnage, where the rock and roll stars grew up. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768546_1_20240901040839.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for next year's Oasis reunion tour sold out by Saturday evening though fans eager to see the band play live for the first time in 16 years complained of technical issues and long online waits that often ended in disappointment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fans trying to access the three websites selling the tickets – Ticketmaster, See Tickets and Gigsandtours – reported issues including error messages and being kicked off before they could purchase tickets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was expected that more than a million tickets for the band's gigs would sell out within minutes. Instead, the band announced all the tickets in Britain had been sold 10 hours later after many fans had spent the day in online queues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has got to be a fairer, simpler, more efficient way of selling tickets," said Dan Walker, the British TV presenter, on X. "In the queue, out of the queue, refresh / don’t refresh, wait in line, back of the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticketmaster earlier said its website has not crashed and the queue was moving along as fans bought tickets. Gigsandtours thanked people for their patience and said there had been "extremely high demand".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, some tickets were relisted on resale sites such as Viagogo for as much as US$10,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oasis announced 17 shows in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with the first due to take place in Cardiff in July 2025, followed by nights in Manchester – where the band was formed in 1991 – London, Edinburgh and Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group, whose debut album "Definitely Maybe" was released 30 years ago, split in 2009 when lead guitarist and main songwriter Noel Gallagher said he could no longer work with his younger brother, Liam, the band's main singer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At its peak in the 1990s, Oasis exemplified the soaring appeal of Britpop, with hits like "Wonderwall," "Live Forever" and "Champagne Supernova". But Noel and Liam were often in conflict and their strained relationship finally snapped in 2009 as they prepared to play a Paris gig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since their split, both brothers have continued their musical careers, but always against the backdrop of calls from fans for the band to reunite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gigs are expected to provide a multi-million dollar boost for Britain and Ireland's hospitality sectors. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Erling Haaland terrorises the West Ham defence again as City take top spot in the Premier League. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768543_1_20240901033649.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland's second successive hat-trick earned Premier League champions Manchester City a 3-1 win at West Ham United on Saturday, while Everton suffered a painful 3-2 home loss to Bournemouth and Aston Villa returned to winning ways as goals by Amadou Onana and Jhon Duran secured a 2-1 victory at Leicester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  City opened up an early two-point lead over last season's runners-up Arsenal, with Haaland following up last week's treble against Ipswich Town to record his seventh goal in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian calmly slotted past Alphonse Areola to put City ahead and, after West Ham equalised against the run of play through Ruben Dias' own goal, Haaland restored City's lead on the half-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland secured the win with another cool finish in the 83rd minute, charging on to Matheus Nunes' through ball and lifting his shot over substitute keeper Lukasz Fabianski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We played really well, it was an unfortunate goal against," City boss Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports. "The second half was more open but we controlled it better and the performance is good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Officially, the pre-season is now over. We played one game a week and it was a super season. Now they play two a week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton, under pressure after two league losses, opened up a 2-0 lead over Bournemouth in a seven-minute spell after the break through goals from Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth spent most of the game on the back foot, but with three minutes left they pulled a goal back when Antoine Semenyo poked home from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In added time, Lewis Cook's powerful header found the back of the net and Luis Sinisterra broke Everton hearts with the winner to leave the hosts rooted to the bottom of the table, booed by their own supporters at full time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After leading 2-0 goals until the 87th minute, Everton's defeat was the latest a team has ever been two or more goals ahead in a Premier League game they have gone on to lose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really let ourselves down in front of our fans," Everton captain Seamus Coleman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa's summer signing Onana touched in from close range after a clever free kick routine in the 28th minute to give his side the lead against Leicester. Hosts Leicester were more of a threat in the second half but Duran's 63rd-minute header proved decisive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford shrugged off the loss of star striker Ivan Toney as Bryan Mbeumo's double and a goal by Yoane Wissa earned a comfortable 3-1 home win over promoted Southampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow promoted side Ipswich Town were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Fulham and Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers played out a 1-1 draw at the City Ground. (Reuters)

 Seven people, including a six-year-old and 16-year-old, were killed when a bus overturned in the US state of Mississippi early Saturday, Warren County Coroner Doug Huskey said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two young victims were siblings, according to the coroner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mississippi Highway Patrol said the incident took place around 12:40am on Interstate 20 near Bovina in Warren County, east of Vicksburg, when a 2018 Volvo commercial passenger bus traveling westbound left the roadway and overturned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-seven passengers were transported to different hospitals with unknown injuries, the agency said. It said the co-driver was not transported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anytime you have people injured or killed, it's tragic but when you have a situation like this where you have multiple fatalities and multiple injuries, it makes it even worse," Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace told an ABC affiliate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huskey said most of the passengers on the bus were Latin American. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong, China's badminton and boccia players closed in on medals at the Paris Paralympics late on Saturday, though two swimming finalists missed out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In badminton, Daniel Chan, a bronze medalist in Tokyo, will take on South Korea's Yu Sooyoung in the semi-final of the men's WH2 on Sunday after comfortably topping his group by beating rivals from Chile and Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chu Man-kai, the top seed in the men's SH6 competition after taking silver in Tokyo, won all three pool games to earn himself a bye through the quarter-finals. He beat opponents from Britain, India and Indonesia to top Group A, and will go again in tonight's semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two women's boccia players also secured semi-final places in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After topping her group in the women's individual BC4, Annie Cheung took control of her quarter-final, beating Laissa Polyana Teixeira of Brazil 4-1. Cheung is at her first Paralympics and next takes on  Malaysia's Noor Askuzaimey Mat Salim in the semi-final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Yuen-kei had to come from behind to win her BC3 quarter-final against Kla-Han Ladamanee of Thailand, scoring twice in the final end to seal a 3-2 victory. She next faces Kang Sunhee for a place in the final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmers Tang Wai-lok and Andy Cheung missed out in the final of the men's  S14 200m freestyle, as Britain's William Ellard smashed the world record to take gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who won gold in the same event in the Rio 2016 Games, finished seventh while Cheung, who is making his Paralympic debut at the age of 19, finished eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ellard dominated from start to finish, taking more than a second off the record with a time of 1min 51.30 seconds. Nicholas Bennett of Canada and Australia's Jack Ireland took silver and bronze respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's Chan Yui-lam and Cheung Ho-ying bowed out in the semi-finals of the equivalent women's event. The S14 category is for swimmers with intellectual disabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang will be back in action in the S14 100m backstroke and the SM14 200m medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's sole para athletics representative, Yam Kwok-fan, missed out on a place in the final of the women's T36 200 metres, finishing fifth in her heat. She's got the 100m coming up later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in boccia, Hong Kong's Leung Yuk-wing saw his campaign end at the quarter-final stage in the men's individual BC4 event. After finishing second in his group, he was beaten 6-1 by Britain's Stephen McGuire in the early hours of Sunday. He'll be back later in the mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BC2 competition, Yeung Hiu-lam was beaten by Britain's Claire Taggart 3-2 in the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Sunday, John Loung of Hong Kong takes on Huadpradit Witsanu of Thailand in men's BC1 quarter-final.

    Rice sees red as Brighton halt Arsenal run

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton and Hove Albion ended Arsenal's winning start to the new Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at The Emirates on Saturday, with the home side holding on with 10 men after Declan Rice's second-half sending off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Arsenal dominated the first half and deservedly lead at half time after Kai Havertz finished brilliantly in the 38th minute, having been played in expertly by Bukayo Saka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes into the second half, however, Arsenal's task was made all the harder when Rice was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Brazilian striker Joao Pedro fired Brighton level 12 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides missed golden chances to win the contest late on, but they each had to settle for a point that keeps Arsenal and Brighton unbeaten from their three games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After narrowly missing out on their first Premier League title since 2004 last season, Arsenal started the new term in perfect fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With champions Manchester City also coming into this weekend's fixtures with two wins from two at the start of the new season, Arsenal know any slip-up, even this early in the campaign, could be costly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They appeared set to be course for a ninth successive league victory after a dominant first-half display. Skipper Martin Odegaard should have scored earlier in the opening period before Havertz lofted home his second of the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rice's second yellow for trying to stop Brighton taking a quick free kick, a decision that was met with consternation around the stands, turned the tide in the visitors' favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Boxing Day 2019 – Mikel Arteta's first game in charge of Arsenal – the Gunners have been shown 16 red cards in the Premier League, at least three more than any other side. But it was Rice's first red in his 245th Premier League appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following his last-gasp winner against Manchester United last weekend, Pedro reacted first after Yankuba Minteh's shot had been saved to pull Brighton level, and the game opened up thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saka could have snatched the win late on, while Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya had to be at his best on several occasions to keep Brighton from earning all three points, but both seemed content with a draw after an exhilarating tussle. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The national security police said on Saturday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention" in relation to a suicide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 41-year-old male suspect had allegedly put memorial light boxes in various places, while a 28-year-old woman is suspected of publishing falsified last words of the deceased.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said the contents provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers holding a court warrant searched the duo's homes in Kowloon and the New Territories yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They seized light boxes, materials for making the boxes and electronic communication devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were detained for investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay flight heading to Hong Kong from Kaohsiung remained grounded just before take-off after one of the aircraft's engines reportedly caught fire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline said the CX431 flight was scheduled to depart at 11.20 am on Saturday, but one of its engines encountered technical problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online videos showed that the flight was preparing for take off on the tarmac, when the engine suddenly shot out of flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A loud bang was heard, and the aircraft later came to a halt on the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline said no passengers or crew were hurt in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay apologised for causing an inconvenience and said it had arranged other flights for the affected passengers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Members of the national team on Saturday said their goodbyes to Hong Kong, saying they were delighted to meet the crowds and were surprised by their enthusiastic reactions, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meeting the press before their departure, weightlifter Li Fabin, who also visited Hong Kong with a delegation three years ago, shared his thoughts on the visit this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time there weren't that many crowds because of the pandemic…This time in Hong Kong, people have been incredibly enthusiastic, something I haven't seen before. The cheers and applause from the Hong Kong residents have deeply touched our hearts and are a strong source of support for us," the two-time Olympic gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also mentioned that he plans to defend his men’s 61 kg title at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving queen Quan Hongchan was asked about her secret to success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's all about staying calm, happy, and not overthinking," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha from the table tennis team visited the Hong Kong Sports Institute on Friday. She said she's thrilled to have had the chance to exchange and interact with Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel like Hong Kong’s overall table tennis standard has improved a lot. From my visit to the Sports Institute yesterday, whether in terms of training equipment or the logistical support, I think it’s getting better. I hope that we can all work hard together for the common goal of fighting for the country,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Synchronised swimmer Wang Qianyi and her elder twin sister Wang Liuyi will pursue PhD degrees at the Education University of Hong Kong in the coming academic year. She said they were looking forward to studying in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've always wanted to experience the campus atmosphere. We hope to enhance ourselves while enjoying the campus life and experiencing different aspects of life beyond training," Wang Qianyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday afternoon, the delegation left Hong Kong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, headed to Macau for a three-day visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official Facebook, Chief Executive John Lee thanked the delegation for bringing an unforgettable experience to Hongkongers and filling the city with a strong sports atmosphere in the past three days.

    Unions make appeals ahead of Policy Address

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The workers' rights groups made a “community version” of the Policy Address. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768482_1_20240902154822.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Various workers' rights groups on Saturday submitted a series of proposals to Chief Executive John Lee ahead of his third Police Address in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suggestions include calls for standard working hours, a higher minimum wage, universal retirement protection, and improved occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the organisations, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, urged the government to review a scheme that reimburses medical expenses for employees injured at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Up to now, the medical expenses [reimbursement] depends on the fee of the public hospital, so that the injured worker only can take back HK$300 per day for their medical expenses for treatment. We think that this amount is not enough for their treatment and recovery,” said Lam Ching-yee, the association’s organiser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also called for the cost of imaging examination services, such as X-ray scans, CT scans and MRI scans, at private clinics to be covered, allowing injured workers to quickly find out their treatment options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, unionists representing property management and security guards urged the government to promote a standard working week of 44 hours and raise the minimum wage to no less than HK$56 per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that security guards are overworked while receiving wages that are not livable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A carer concern group called for changes to the Social Welfare Department's caregiver allowance. It suggested eliminating the eligibility review mechanism, lower application thresholds, and allow caregivers to receive the allowance in their own name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many groups also pointed to the need for a universal retirement protection scheme, advocating for a tripartite contribution model where the government, large businesses, and individual employees all contribute to the pension system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Saturday entertained cheering crowds in Hong Kong by putting on spectacular sporting displays, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Divers and swimmers headed to Victoria Park swimming pool, with synchronised swimming twins Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi kicking off the ticket-only demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those taking a dive into the pool was fan favourite Quan Hongchan, who received roaring cheers. The 17-year-old won the women's individual and synchronised 10m platform competitions at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan, who brought along her famous collection of turtle toys, introduced herself to the audience in Cantonese and ended the post-demonstration interview with a signature blessing: " Kung hei fat choy!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow diver Chen Yiwen, who won two golds at the Paris Olympics, also climbed the steps to the springboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is interesting to be able to showcase diving in such way. It's not as serious as in competitions," Chen said. "We perform in an entertaining way, and we also interact with everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations at the pool later turned cheeky with a series of wacky dives and fun leaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai, athletes from land-based disciplines wowed spectators with showcases of gymnastics, badminton and table tennis, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton mixed doubles champions Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong demonstrated some techniques alongside women's doubles duo Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan, with the latter pair also trading partners with the SAR's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam for a showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To add some more fun, Sheng Lihao, who won in the men's 10m air rifle in Paris, also took a shot in badminton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team's clean sweep of gold medals in table tennis did not go unnoticed at the stadium amid loud applause from the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lucky spectator was picked to play against ping pong legend Ma Long, with women's singles champion Chen Meng guiding her, hand in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd also caught a glimpse of the breakdancing scene from bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, also known as "671".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rounding up the demonstrations in Wan Chai was a video speech from Hong Kong's sole two-time Olympic gold medallist, Edgar Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be able to appreciate the grace of so many world number ones at such a close distance is really a rare thing. It's pity that I am not in Hong Kong, so I can't be here in person to participate in this event," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's events marked the end of a visit by the national team to Hong Kong, which next heads to neighbouring Macau.

    Talent scheme focus is on abilities: Chris Sun

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Talent scheme focus is on abilities: Chris Sun" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768464_1_20240831111624.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The labour minister said on Saturday that the focus remains on the abilities as well as the perspectives of imported talents, instead of their nationalities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 95 percent of those coming to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme are from the mainland, but Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun emphasised that it does not make the scheme any less international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, the minister pointed out that most of the talent coming from Category C of the scheme - full-time bachelor's degree graduates in the past five years with less than three years of work experience - attained their degrees from universities in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While they may be mainlanders, they received their higher education in America. Obviously, they have a more international perspective. With these people in Hong Kong, I am sure they are going to bring benefits and will add value to our economy," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of talent is expected to apply for a visa renewal as soon as early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the bureau is still conducting a review of the scheme, which was rolled out in 2022, and plans to diversify its pool of overseas talent.

  The minister added that Malaysia will be the authorities' first destination in Southeast Asia, citing the compatibility with the ethnic Chinese community there who are mostly trilingual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said the government has approved 21,000 applications for the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed that if the shortage of local labour forces is alleviated, the authority will "definitely" reduce its quotas for imported labour.

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the new school year begins on Monday, a psychologist is urging parents to pay attention to their children's emotional, physiological and behavioural well-being.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheryl So, a senior clinical psychologist at Kwai Chung Hospital, stressed that students of different ages face different forms of stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While pre-schoolers struggle to leave their comfort zones and adapt to unfamiliar environments, primary and secondary school students are expected to learn to be independent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents are advised to look out for signs of potential problems such as depression, extreme mood swings, headaches, stomachaches, prolonged sleep disturbances, fear of separation from family or excessive self-criticism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If such symptoms persist for more than a month, they should seek professional help," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that teachers and parents can play different roles depending on the developmental stage of their students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like for kindergarten, for parents, I think the first day of school is better to give them a very positive goodbye. They have to leave familiar people. They have to go to some uncharted area, that is, school," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For more than two decades, the hospital has worked with the education sector and charities to raise awareness of mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 16,000 students from over 100 schools have taken part in programmes that facilitate interaction with people who have recovered from mental health problems, with the aim of combating stigma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We provide some talk on common mental health issues students will face. And then we'll also teach them some stress management, emotion regulation skills. We also provide some workshops to train them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How to deal with mental health issues... how to interact with a person in recovery... so through the contact with them, they will realise mental illness is not that horrible. And they will have a more accurate understanding of mental illness and better experience with people in recovery."

   Ng, who is competing in three events at the Games at the age of 14, clocked a personal best record of 3:11.95 in the women's 200 metres medley SM6 final in Paris, which was won in dominant fashion by British world record holder Maisie Summers-Newton.

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768437_1_20240831053139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen kept up the momentum from her victory in Paris with a cathartic win over Germany's Jule Niemeier at the US Open on Friday, while another Chinese woman, Wang Yafan, put out three-time Flushing Meadow finalist Victoria Azarenka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng breezed to a 6-2, 6-1 third round win over Jule Niemeier of Germany in 1 hour and 21 minutes,  exacting a bit of revenge on Niemeier, who eliminated her in this tournament in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I remember that match so clear," Zheng said. "I lost that match at midnight – it was a tough match and really painful. I remember I sat one hour in (the US Open site) at, I don't know, 3 o'clock, there crying by myself alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So today when I play against her, since the beginning I'm really focused, because I don't want that feeling to happen again to me. I'm glad I'm the winner today so I don't have to cry!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng next takes on Donna Vekic of Croatia on Sunday in a repeat of the Paris Games final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Wang recorded a 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 win over twentieth-seeded Azarenka to set up a fourth round tie against Paula Badosa, the 26th seed from Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Coco Gauff continued in her pursuit of recording back-to-back US Open titles by rallying to a 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Elina Svitolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Gauff overcame a mistake-filled first set by saving five of seven break points against the 27th-seeded Svitolina of Ukraine. The highlight of the match came in the third set when Gauff outlasted Svitolina during a fierce 37-stroke exchange that ended when the latter's backhand sailed wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She's a fighter," the 20-year-old Gauff said of Svitolina, a three-time major semifinalist. "I knew I had to play my best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff hopes to give the fans a thrill on Sunday when she vies for a spot in the quarterfinals against 13th-seeded Emma Navarro, who posted a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over 19th-seeded Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine. (Reuters/RTHK)

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768428_1_20240831043216.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose and the Dow scored a second consecutive all-time closing high on Friday, with Tesla and Amazon climbing after fresh US economic data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates modestly in September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US consumer spending increased solidly in July, suggesting the economy remained strong while prices rose moderately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are seeing another sign of being in a soft landing," said Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at Newedge Wealth. "It's another one of those Goldilocks kind of reports really threading a needle right down the centre. The market is really getting exactly what it wanted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "just-right" Goldilocks economy has steady growth, but not too much that it fuels excessive inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon.com and Tesla each jumped over 3 percent. Broadcom rallied nearly 4 percent, while Marvell Technology surged 9 percent after the chipmaker forecast quarterly results above estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's personal consumption expenditures report was the last major economic data release before the Fed's September meeting. Chair Jerome Powell last week expressed support for an imminent policy adjustment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Money markets suggest traders mostly expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, with odds of a 50 basis point cut dimming further after Friday's data, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday ended a tumultuous month on Wall Street after signs of a sudden moderation in the labour market in early August sparked fears of a US recession. The influence of the Japanese yen carry trade worsened the rout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares have rebounded since then, with the S&P 500 trading near record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.01 percent to end at 5,648 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.13 percent to 17,714 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.55 percent to 41,563 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the month, the S&P 500 rose 2.3 percent, the Dow added 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia rose 1.5 percent, rebounding from a 6.4 percent drop on Thursday after the artificial intelligence-chip bellwether failed to match sky-high investor expectations, despite upbeat results and a broadly in-line forecast. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian Supreme Court justice ordered on Friday the "immediately suspension" of social media platform X in the country, after a court-imposed deadline expired for the company to identify a legal representative in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is the latest chapter in an ongoing feud between Justice Alexandre de Moraes and Elon Musk, which also included the freezing of the satellite internet provider Starlink's financial accounts in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the decision, Moraes ordered the full and immediate suspension of X in the country until all related court orders on X were complied with, including the payment of fines amounting 18.5 million reais (US$3.28 million) and the nomination of a legal representative in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moraes ordered telecomunications regulator Anatel to implement the suspension order, and to confirm to the court within 24 hours that it has carried it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a bid to avoid the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent the blockage, Moraes said that individuals or companies who tried to keep access to the social network that way could be fined up to 50,000 reais a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  X said late on Thursday that it expected Moraes to order a shutdown "soon. Earlier this year, Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts implicated in probes of so-called digital militias accused of spreading distorted news and hate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk, denouncing the order as censorship, responded by closing the platform's offices in Brazil. X, formerly known as Twitter, said at the time that its services would still be available in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid the underlying feud over X, Brazil's Supreme Court also blocked the local bank accounts of the Starlink satellite internet firm, which is 40 percent owned by Musk, leading the company on Friday to ask the court to suspend that decision. (Reuters)

 President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed Ukraine's Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk on Friday, according to a presidential decree.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The dismissal was announced just a day after the Ukrainian military reported that an F-16 jet crashed and its pilot died while repelling a major Russian strike on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have decided to replace the commander of the Air Forces... I am eternally grateful to all our military pilots," President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his evening address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not give a reason for dismissal but mentioned that personnel must be protected, and that there was a need to strengthen the command level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's General Staff said that General Lieutenant Anatoliy Kryvonozhka would temporarily perform the duties of commander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian military did not provide a reason for Monday's crash but said the jet came down while it was approaching a Russian target. Oleshchuk said on Monday partners from the US were helping to investigate the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US defence official said that the crash did not appear to be the result of Russian fire, and possible causes from pilot error to mechanical failure were still being investigated. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong, China teenager Jasmine Ng placed sixth in her women's 200 metres medley SM6 final at the Paris Paralympics on Friday, with British world record holder Maisie Summers-Newton taking gold far ahead of the field.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu Daomin took bronze for the national team while Ellie Marks of the United States won the silver medal, albeit more than five seconds behind Summers-Newton, who went close to her own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who is taking on three events at the Games at the age of just 14, finished in 3mins, 11.95 seconds. She'd qualified fifith fastest for the final. She's next in action late on Sunday in the 100m breaststroke SB6 final and has the 100m backstroke event to come later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SM6 category denotes medley swimming races for athletes with a number of different types of disability including short stature, major limb impairment or loss in two limbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, boccia athlete Annie Cheung Yuen made it a clean sweep in group play, beating Phonsila Nuanchan of Thailand 5-2. After topping Pool C in the women's BC4 event, she takes on Brazilian Polyana Teixeira in the quarter finals on Sunday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Archer Wilson Ngai, however, went out in the round of 32, losing to Jere Forsberg of Finland, 142-137.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the national team, Hong Yang added a third swimming medal of the Games for China as he won the 200m individual medley SM6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Zhou Xia won China's first gold medal of the athletics events when she sprinted to the women's T35 100m title, for people with impaired coordination, in a time of 13.58sec. (additional reporting by AFP)

    Govt condemns remarks against Stand News verdict

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768396_1_20240830211335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday strongly condemned untruthful remarks smearing the freedom of press in Hong Kong, after former editors of the now-defunct Stand News were convicted of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in a statement, the authorities said officials from the United States and Western countries, anti-China organisations and some foreign media had made "untruthful and purely political" remarks regarding the judgment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said freedom of the press is protected under Hong Kong law, but it stressed that reporters must follow the principle of "responsible journalism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like all other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. Journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticising government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law," it wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the media and relevant personnel publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security or public order, or of public health or morals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities pointed out that the District Court had said the relevant reports and articles by Stand News were not based on facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reasons for verdict have also pointed out clearly that the ideology of Stand News was localism which excluded China, and that it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government during the 'anti-extradition amendment bill incidents'," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government added that the United States and Western countries had "double standards", as these countries have carried out enforcement actions against the dissemination of disinformation and incitement of hatred.

    WHO says mpox vaccines on way to DR Congo

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vaccines are prepared at a Bavarian Nordic production line. Photo: via Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768408_1_20240830233802.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation chief said on Friday that mpox vaccines were set to arrive in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the next few days to fight a new strain of the virus.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We hope to have the first delivery in the next few days, and then it will build up," Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at a media conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 230,000 mpox doses are immediately available to be dispatched, added WHO official Tim Nguyen. These doses were donated by the European Commission and Danish mpox vaccine manufacturer Bavarian Nordic, Nguyen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO has said that its partners can start buying mpox vaccines before they are approved by the UN health agency, lifting its usual rules in a bid to get inoculations to Africa faster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is currently reviewing applications for emergency licences for two vaccines made by Bavarian Nordic and Japan's KM Biologics. Tedros said these were expected to be granted in the next two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rosamund Lewis, the WHO technical lead for mpox, said she hoped the vaccines and other interventions by health partners would help cases come down again in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An mpox diagnostic manufacturer also expressed interest in securing WHO's emergency use listing for their kit a day after the agency opened the process, Tedros said without naming the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighbouring countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 18,000 suspected cases of mpox have been reported in Congo so far this year with 629 deaths, while over 150 cases have also been confirmed in Burundi, Tedros said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Friday showed off some of their skills and shared insights and stories from the Paris Games at an evening gala.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium was one of the events where local fans could interact with the competitors during their three-day visit to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening of the show, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong residents had been looking forward to meeting the elite athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the Olympics, Hong Kong had a fiery atmosphere for the Games, and residents watched free broadcasts through the night to support the mainland and SAR athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From watching the broadcast from ten thousand miles away, to seeing the athletes first-hand, I believe everyone is excited and looking forward to the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes shared positive vibes with Hong Kong fans, and showcased their skills at the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I, of course, have to play for my country on the court, but in life, I think we need to chill out, and be happy. I hope everyone can spend every day happily," table tennis player Sun Yingsha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shuttler Zheng Siwei said he missed his usual mixed doubles teammate Huang Yaqiong after being assigned a new partner. However, he was happy to be reunited with Huang at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People only cherish something after losing it. I believe everyone’s experienced this before. Please cherish the one who fights alongside with you and the one who accompanies you," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some national team athletes, such as table tennis player Fan Zhendong and diver Quan Hongchan, used Cantonese to greet the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few SAR Olympians, such as gold medal fencer Vivian Kong, and shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet, were also at the stadium and shared their experiences with the audience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday said it has fined WeChat Pay Hong Kong for failing to prevent risks associated with the financing of terrorism and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following an investigation, the digital wallet service provider was ordered to pay a penalty of HK$875,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said WeChat Pay Hong Kong does not have a robust system for conducting customer due diligence reviews upon incidents that pose a risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA executive director Raymond Chan urged mobile wallet service operators to strengthen their due diligence procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVF (Stored Value Facilities) licensees should apply enhanced due diligence measures on their customers in situations involving potentially high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing," Chan said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These enhanced due diligence measures should be effective in ensuring that the associated money laundering and terrorist financing risks are properly managed."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Social Workers Association (HKSWA) on Friday urged local employers to recruit more disabled people when considering their hiring needs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the number of disabled people who had attained a bachelor's degree from eight UGC-funded universities tripled to around 1,500 in the academic year spanning 2023 to 2024, compared to four years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKSWA recommended that companies be given training before hiring people with disabilities, so they can be assigned tasks according to their strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athena Ng, who is visually impaired, said she was worried about communicating with her peers in the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people rely on visuals on when they communicate. For example, they would point at a particular object when referring to it. But the visually impaired are unable to [do that], leading to communication issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng now works for a product development company that cooperates with the Hong Kong Blind Union to train the disabled as badminton racket stringers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Kwan Wing-fai revealed his company has employed four disabled persons - all but one suffered from hearing difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was concerned about their working abilities to begin with, but he found these worries were unfounded as they performed even better than able-bodied people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They completed the project on time and even completed it earlier than our target. I think they give me the confidence to employ the disabled again," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Kwan from the HKSWA's Professional Development Committee said many non-governmental organisations are doing a good job in supporting people with disabilities by providing them with training and counselling services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I think the government may do more, for example, the government can support NGOs, to give more resources to NGOs to promote or support enterprises to foster an inclusive culture in the business sector."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 11.8 percent in July compared to the same month last year, marking the fifth month of declines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Friday showed the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.1 billion in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slump follows a 9.7 percent drop in June and an 11.4 percent decrease in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined further in July from a year earlier amid the continued impact of the change in consumption patterns and the strong Hong Kong dollar," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More outbound travels by residents during the summer holidays was also one of the factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the government said challenges remain, but the authorities will continue to support small and medium-sized enterprises, including those in the retail industry.

 Typhoon Shanshan weakened to a tropical storm on Friday, but was still dumping heavy rains as it slowly churned through Japan, triggering transport havoc and landslide warnings, with up to six people killed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The storm, which at landfall was one of the strongest to hit Japan in decades, pummelled Kyushu island on Thursday with gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before making landfall, a landslide caused by the heavy rains preceding the storm killed three members of the same family late on Tuesday in Aichi prefecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi on Friday confirmed reports of one additional death, but said that "the relation to the typhoon was being studied".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more were feared dead and two others were missing, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight people were seriously hurt and 70 others had light injuries, Hayashi said, with many injured by broken glass after the typhoon smashed windows and ripped tiles off roofs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 200 buildings were damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rapid attribution analysis issued on Friday by Imperial College London, using peer-reviewed methodology, calculated that Typhoon Shanshan's winds were made 26 percent more likely by a warming planet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without phasing out fossil fuels, the root cause of climate change, typhoons will bring even greater devastation to Japan," said Ralf Toumi, director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coming storm prompted Japanese authorities to issue their highest alert in several areas, with more than five million people advised to evacuate their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday the Japan Meteorological Agency issued alerts for possible landslides in many parts of Kyushu, and as far away as Shizuoka on the main island of Honshu, the Tokyo region and nearby Kanagawa. (AFP)
