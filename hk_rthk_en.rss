<div class="itemFullText">
 Wong Chun-ting of Hong Kong put up a good fight in his round-of-32 men's table tennis singles match at the Paris Olympics, but he was no match for second-seeded Fan Zhendong of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan was off to a fast start, racing to a 2-0 lead by taking the first two games 11-5, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong came to life in the third game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He jumped out to leads of 4-0 and 5-1 before holding on for an 11-9 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fan simply proved too strong for his SAR opponent. He went on to capture the next two games 11-6, 11-3 to complete a 4-1 win in 36 minutes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Zhu Chengzhu on Wednesday bowed out of the women's singles event at the Paris Olympics, losing 0-4 in her round of 32 match against Japan's Miu Hirano.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy this time, and I enjoyed every game," she said after the match. "I think it’s normal whether I win or lose – there will be a women’s team battle next, so I will prepare well for every game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anything is possible because of this venue. Although I was not feeling as confident today, if I am confident, anything is possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Zhu is next set to compete in the women's team round of 16 next Tuesday, when the Hong Kong, China team take on Sweden at South Paris Arena 4.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official advance estimates released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compares with a revised 2.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed the second quarter growth to an increase in exports and investment spending, saying it expects the economy to continue to expand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year, but performance of the different economic segments may vary amid uncertainties on various fronts," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions, escalating trade conflicts, and US interest rate trajectory remaining not entirely clear may add uncertainties to economic sentiment and activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Natixis Asia Pacific economist Gary Ng said the figure for the second quarter was slightly higher than he expected, but pressures still remain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the other components, such as the contraction in the household spending and also the greater growth in the import of services, which is basically reflecting the outbound tourism and also the rebound in investment, which basically just get back to the pre-Covid level and is still 16 percent lower than 2018 for the same period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think these are all the sorts of pressures that I would see within the economy that can actually drag the growth rate further in the future."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific and HK Express passengers can now use their mobiles to check in baggage at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using the airlines' apps, passengers can get a printed tag at special channels and drop off their luggage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The function is only available to people with electronic travel documents who are flying to places where they don't require a visa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris Au Young, the general manager of data analytics at the Airport Authority, said the new bag drop service will save passengers time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So if we compare that method with the old method, the old method takes two minutes more. If we don't count any time used for lining up, the entire process is shortened from three minutes to only one," he told the media on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au Young said the authority hopes to expand the function so it can be used by 80 percent of passengers leaving Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings on Wednesday said its first-half pre-tax profit came in at US$21.6 billion, a 0.5 percent decline compared to the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it will pay an interim dividend of 10 US cents per share, the second payment this year following the 31 US cents announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC also announced a further three-month repurchase of up to US$3 billion, following the completed US$3 billion buyback announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With several major central banks seen likely to cut interest rates later this year, the group's outgoing chief executive, Noel Quinn, told an online press call that HSBC has reduced its sensitivity to interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we knew that interest rate declines were going to come at some stage, we've been investing heavily in building up alternative revenue growth options, mainly around wealth, international wholesale banking and international transaction banking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incumbent chief financial officer, Georges Elhedery, will step into the chief executive role in September following Quinn's retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery highlighted the bank's commitment to its core Hong Kong and UK markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bulk of our capital and resources are deployed in our four scale activities, that is Hong Kong, the UK, our international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities, and our wealth proposition, and that's in particular in Asia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm intending to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, intending to continue improving operating leverage, while maintaining a very strong discipline which is now embedded in the firm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has named Jonathan Bingham as the interim group chief financial officer, effective from September 2.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong University's Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it has developed a medical-grade smartphone stethoscope for early detection of valvular heart disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The faculty said the AI-powered software Vitogram has an estimated accuracy of 81 percent for detecting significant valvular disease, a level comparable to a doctor's assessment using a traditional stethoscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it does not replace the function of a doctor, you still need a doctor to perform comprehensive assessment on a patient for proper diagnosis, but our invention provides a very powerful disease screening tool," said Associate Professor Joshua Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitogram uses AI to measure heart sounds from four parts of the chest, with each measurement taking approximately 10 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho described the tool as an "AI doctor in your pocket" that allows anyone to conveniently assess their own health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university's Dr. Wong Chun-Ka said Vitogram is among the first software able to record and analyse heart sounds, as opposed to just a person's heart rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are able to detect structural diseases like valve disease, which is not possible using previous commercially available devices," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university is hoping that Vitogram will be available on the market in the next six months to a year and is looking to partner with healthcare organisations in places including Singapore and Malaysia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said Hong Kong will sign 13 agreements with Cambodia to boost trade and investment between the two places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Deputy Prime Minister Sar Sokha, Lee said Hong Kong will enhance collaboration with Cambodia across various sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Cambodia and Hong Kong will be closer than ever before. I'm confident we will work to further strengthen cooperation between the two governments, promote commerce, tourism, and cultural exchanges, strengthen people-to-people ties and jointly contribute to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said that the Trade Development Council will set up an office in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to promote business ties between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that he and Cambodian officials have discussed easing visa and travel rules to promote tourism in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Cambodia for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five new taxi fleets are expected to hit the streets within a year after beating several other applicants to win licences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities on Wednesday said they received 15 applications in total, but three did not meet the requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the chosen fleets, three will operate only urban taxis, while the other two will cover urban areas as well as the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms have a year to complete their preparations and will operate a total of 3,500 cabs, accounting for a fifth of the taxis in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said fleet operators will provide training for drivers and monitor their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said they have to offer a number of electronic payment methods as well as online car-hailing services with no cap on booking fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individual applicants may engage different partners for developing the online platform for them. There will be quite a room for development, taking into account their own market strategies and the clientele they are targeting. We do not stipulate the hard-and-fast rule on how the online services will have to be done," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For trips booked in advance, we will allow the flexibility for the taxi drivers to charge at a pre-agreed rate, or to charge according to the meter, plus an additional amount as the pre-booking fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers will be able to rate their taxi drivers with a complaint mechanism in place, the transport official said, adding that serious breaches could result in the termination of licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said car parks in Tsing Yi and Tai Po are in the pipeline for the taxis, and the authorities will look into whether to expand the scheme to grant more licences in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the fleet operators, Sino Development, said it will operate taxis across the city, including on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to make good use of our resources and operate all 1,000 taxis to provide quality services to citizens," said fleet operations manager Wong Tai-hoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For full-time cabbies, we will need 2,000 of them, on top of 1,000 part-time, substitute drivers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung from another operator, Big Boss Taxi Company, said the group already has a number of taxis in line with the requirement that vehicles in the fleets must not be more than three years old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Coming from the taxi industry, we already have on hand almost 200 taxis. They are ready to be deployed anytime. But we do want to have a more diverse fleet, which includes the premium taxis as well as the ones for wheelchairs," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Likely we will do a soft launch at the end of this year, maybe perhaps early next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fleet operator SynCab Service, for its part, said it will bring in over 120 new cabs before the end of the year, including six-seater, electric taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said reserving a journey in a six-seater is expected to cost 10 to 25 percent more than a taxi meter charge.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign business leaders on Wednesday said a new permit is providing easier access to the mainland, as the first batch of non-Chinese permanent residents in Hong Kong received their travel cards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Permit holders can travel to the mainland within the five-year validity period, with each stay not exceeding 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce, Dato' Gan Khai Choon, was among those collecting their permits at a China Travel Service centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we wanted to go to mainland China, in the early days, we had to apply for a visa like everybody else. But for Malaysians ourselves, we also needed to apply for permission from our Malaysian government to have a permit to go into China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When China and Malaysia had a better relationship, we could apply independently without the Malaysian approval. But even at that time, to apply for a visa, it was quite difficult because the process and passport requirements were quite cumbersome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the application process for the new permit was smooth with the application centre offering him a "first-class service", and that he's planning to travel to the mainland in the coming few weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former committee member of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, Alfred Buchner, received his permit after filing an application around three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hasn't travelled to the mainland for seven years, because he wanted to avoid the hassle of going through the visa application process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of suppliers which I see in China, where I have contact in China, so far only by email... With this travel permit, it's a big encouragement to visit China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buchner, who picked up his permit along with his family, said he would first travel to Shenzhen for a weekend trip.

    Olympic triathlon events to go ahead

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great joy that we received this news," Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. "Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five women representing 34 countries and regions will kick off the contest at 2pm Hong Kong time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Jason Ng will participate in the men's event, which begins at 4.45pm, immediately after the women's race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The results of the latest water analyses...have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place," Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris has spent US$1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, the Palestinian militant group and Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said in separate statements on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian’s swearing in ceremony on Tuesday. The Guards said the attack was under investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this morning, the residence of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was struck, resulting in his and one of his body guards' martyrdom. The cause is under investigation and will be announced soon," the Revolutionary Guards said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamist faction, Hamas, mourned the death of Haniyeh, who it said was killed in "a treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts on Iranian state television immediately began blaming Israel for the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israel had vowed to kill Haniyeh and other leaders of Hamas over the group’s October 7 attack on the country that killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel itself did not immediately comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel's war with Hamas since the October attack, more than 39,360 Palestinians have been killed and more than 90,900 wounded, according to health authorities in Gaza. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, says the city does not have sufficient sports venues. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764001_1_20240731110512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), Vincent Cheng, on Wednesday called on the government to provide more details about proposed new sports facilities, saying Hong Kong currently needs more venues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Cheng noted that proposals for new sports facilities, such as a fencing area and swimming pools, were put forward in the past two chief executive policy addresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't see the government earmarking any land or a firm timetable for when construction will be completed. It takes time to build such facilities and I hope the authorities will announce a timetable as soon as possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said new HKSI facilities will be completed by the end of the year, but they will not provide a significant increase in space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China Table Tennis Association coach Yeung Ping-chiu echoed Cheng's remarks, saying a lack of facilities poses a major challenge for various sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said its fighter jets "eliminated" Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in the area of Beirut on Tuesday, accusing him of being responsible for a rocket strike on the annexed Golan Heights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israeli air force fighter jets eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organisation's most senior military commander and the head of its strategic unit, Fuad Shukr, in the area of Beirut," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the commander responsible for the Majdal Shams massacre, in which 12 children were murdered after Hezbollah fired an Iranian Falaq-1 rocket directly at a soccer field in northern Israel on Saturday evening," military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a separate video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the right-hand man to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader and his advisor in planning and directing attacks and operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hagari said Shukr was a "senior terrorist who has the blood of Israelis and many others on his hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the Gaza war, Shukr directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets and UAVs, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said that in the 1990s the Hezbollah commander was "directly involved" in the abduction of the bodies of three Israeli soldiers -- Benyamin Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Sawaid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three were killed by Hezbollah while patrolling the security fence adjacent to Har Dov, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since then, he has planned and directed numerous terror attacks against innocent civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Israel wanted to end hostilities without any wider war with Hezbollah, its forces were ready for "any scenario," Hagari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah's ongoing aggression and brutal attacks are dragging the people of Lebanon and the entire Middle East into a wider escalation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we prefer to resolve hostilities without a wider war, the IDF (Israeli army) is fully prepared for any scenario." (AFP)

    Wong Ka-lee tells judokas Olympics not a pipe dream

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763678_1_20240731090156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Olympian Wong Ka-lee said she hopes her journey to Paris will inspire other young judokas to pursue their dreams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was the third judoka ever from Hong Kong to qualify for the Olympics, marking the return of a local judoka to the Games after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was eliminated in the women’s under 48kg competition by Austrian Katharina Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Wong believes her presence in the Olympics would show others that they too can make it to the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Younger [athletes] may think the Olympics are out of reach. But going to the Olympics this time can show them that it’s not. They can all do it,” she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete said her judo journey is far from over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics are a good experience. I see that I have obviously improved this year in terms of throwing techniques. I hope I can perform better in the next competition,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-time Olympian said she will stay in Paris to watch the matches of top judokas and visit wineries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said she will continue to sharpen her skills, and her next goal is the Asian Judo Open Hong Kong which starts in November.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq tumbled again while the Dow forged higher on Tuesday as investors continued to steer funds away from artificial intelligence equities toward other sectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing so-called "rotation" from tech giants to smaller and medium-sized company comes as some of the biggest tech companies are set to report quarterly results in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, noted that this buying trend may be almost over now that Microsoft, Nvidia and others have fallen significantly from their peaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent to 40,743.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.5 percent to 5,436, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.3 percent to 17,147.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft reported after the market closed on Tuesday, while Apple, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta will report over the next two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This rotation likely stops when we get the majority of these mega caps to report," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Procter & Gamble dropped 4.9 percent as it reported a seven percent fall in quarterly profits on flat sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowdstrike also plunged nearly 10 percent following reports Delta hired attorney David Boies to seek damages following an IT outage that threw the airline's operations into turmoil for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the deluge of corporate earnings, this week's calendar includes Wednesday's Fed decision, as well as monthly US employment data on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Siobhan Haughey is heading into the women’s 100m freestyle showdown as the favourite, after qualifying the fastest out of the 16 swimmers in the semi-finals at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey, who notched a silver in Tokyo, clocked 52.64 seconds, 0.08 seconds ahead of Australia’s Shayna Jack in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old SAR star was only fourth at the halfway mark, but moved past her rivals with a late charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Yang Junxuan also punched her final ticket alongside world recorder holder Sarah Sjoestroem, but Wu Qingfeng barely missed out on a spot after finishing ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the pool, China's Pan Zhanle also qualified fastest in the men's 100m freestyle semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world and Olympic record holder will go up against Australia's Kyle Chalmers, the 2016 champion who set a time of 47.58 seconds, 0.37 seconds slower than Yang.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States reclaimed the women's gymnastics team gold in dominant fashion on Tuesday, while Simone Biles took centre stage again with a captivating performance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biles, together with teammates Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Sunisa Lee, led wire-to-wire. They finished with a score of 171.296, 5.802 more than silver medallists Italy, while Brazil rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, winners at the 2008 Beijing Games, finished a disappointing sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a shocking withdrawal from the team event in Tokyo, Biles has cemented her status as the world's most decorated gymnast by clinching her fifth Olympic gold, and eighth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Americans already had gold in the bag when Biles brought the Bercy Arena crowd to their feet with a gravity-defying floor routine that featured two of her signature skills - a double back flip with a half twist and the "triple-double" of two back flips with three twists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-seven-year-old Biles is set to add more medals to her cabinet after qualifying to four individual events in Paris. (Additional reporting by AFP)

 Hong Kong, China badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu made a winning start in his maiden Olympic appearance, beating Mexico's Luis Ramon Garrido in the group stage of the men's singles tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee, the world number 17 who missed out on a spot for the Tokyo Games in 2021, overpowered his opponent 21-5 in the first game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 66th-ranked Garrido, who was also making his Olympic debut in Paris, took the ensuing game 21-15 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair exchanged leads in a nail-biting finale, but Lee eventually came out on top after pulling away late on to win 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top men's shuttler from the SAR next faces Chou Tien-chien of Chinese Taipei Wednesday evening, Hong Kong time. The winner of that match will advance to the round of 16, as Chou had already beaten Garrido earlier in their group tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a different story for another local badminton player, Happy Lo, who ended her Olympic journey after losing her second straight group match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supanida Katethong of Thailand beat Lo 21-14, 21-9.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Edgar Cheung's win over Fillippo Macchi has sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian fans. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763930_1_20240730221521.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China said it respects the decision of the referees in a controversy involving fencer Edgar Cheung's win over his Italian opponent in the individual foil final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The Olympic Games are the highest-level events in the world. As always, the SF&OC and athletes adhere to and firmly believe in the Olympic spirit, respecting all game results and referee decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian Fencing Federation earlier lodged a complaint against what it called “unacceptable refereeing decisions” in Cheung's 15-14 win over Fillippo Macchi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President of the federation, Paolo Azzi, said he was disappointed with the conclusion the match, adding that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been robbed of the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were two occasions where both fencers landed their touches, but the referees from Chinese Taipei and South Korea ruled that no point should be awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macchi wrote in his Instagram post that he didn’t want to blame the referees for his defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that for sure the refereeing could have been better. It's impossible to not call three touches but at the end of the day that's the nature of the competition," Nicola Lu, epee coach of SAR fencer Cedric Ho, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have external factors that we cannot control and we can only focus on doing our best and focusing on our own actions,” Lu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case also sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian netizens on the social media platforms of the two fencers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, felt it was unlikely that Cheung will be stripped of his gold due to Italy's appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don’t think it will affect [the result] because the referees were very careful. They made the judgement after watching video replays many times. Even when you ask [other] people to review the play, it will still be the same result," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that the referees must decide responsibly when it’s hard to tell who wins or loses, adding that it’s normal for people to have different interpretations.

 Chinese pair Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha captured the gold medal for the table tennis mixed doubles event at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, after defeating Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong of North Korea 4-2 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Chinese duo, who won the 2021 and 2023 World championships, beat their North Korean opponents 11-6, 7-11, 11-8, 11-5, 7-11 and 11-8 at the South Paris Arena 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, North Korea said they could learn from China after winning their first Olympic medal in eight years on Tuesday in Paris.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting fought hard in the bronze-medal match of the mixed doubles table tennis event at the Paris Olympics, but they weren’t able to make it to the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team on Tuesday lost 0-4 to South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon in a match lasting 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean pair were off to a quick start, winning the first game 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then raced to a 3-0 lead, taking the second and third games 11-7, 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong pushed hard to catch up in a nail-biting fourth game, but it eventually went to Shin and Lim, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although we missed the medal by a small margin, the fact that we got into the top four this time is already a big breakthrough," Doo said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because actually there were a lot of teams before whose ability were better or similar to ours. Including the semi-finals, we really did keep trying to become better. Even though the ending was not the best, we did try our best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the defeat, it's the best finish for Hong Kong in mixed doubles table tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's a bit of a pity, especially since we had a chance to get a medal both today and yesterday," Wong said. "Although we are not very satisfied with our performance today, we were already thinking hard and communicating with each other about any strategy we can have before the match."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Landslides in India triggered by pounding monsoon rains struck tea plantations and killed at least 108 people on Tuesday, with at least 250 others rescued from mud and debris, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The southern coastal state of Kerala has been battered by torrential downpours, with blocked roads into the disaster area in Wayanad district complicating relief efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "93 dead bodies have been found so far," Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters. "This is one of the worst natural calamities that our state has seen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 128 people had been hospitalised for treatment after their rescue, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wayanad is famed for the tea estates that crisscross its hilly countryside and which rely on a large pool of casual labourers for planting and harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several estates in the district were hit by two successive landslides before dawn when most of their inhabitants were asleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published by the National Disaster Response Force showed rescue crews trudging through mud to search for survivors and carry bodies on stretchers out of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homes were caked with brown sludge as the force of the landslide scattered cars, corrugated iron and other debris around the disaster site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army said it had deployed more than 200 soldiers to the area to assist state security forces and fire crews in search-and-rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kerala state excise minister M.B. Rajesh said more than 250 people had been rescued so far, The Hindu newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's office said families of victims would receive a compensation payment of US$2,400.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More rainfall and strong winds were forecast in Kerala on Tuesday, the state's disaster management agency said. (AFP)

    Gauff crashes out of Paris Olympics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gauff talks with an official during her match against Croatia's Donna Vekic. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763919_1_20240730203828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff was left in tears after getting into an extended argument with the chair umpire over a ruling during the reigning U.S. Open champion's 7-6 (7), 6-2 loss to Donna Vekic of Croatia in a Paris Olympics third-round singles match Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number two Gauff claimed she was "getting cheated" over a line call in the sixth game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She then walked over to talk to the official, and play was delayed for several minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball," Gauff said to Campistol. “It’s not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her first Olympic singles tournament – she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles – ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 32 degrees celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Ian Ho has been eliminated from the men’s 100m freestyle event on Tuesday at the Olympic Games, finishing 55th overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is competing for the second time at the Games, finished sixth in his heat with a time of 51.46 seconds, 2.62 seconds behind the heat 5 winner Lamar Taylor of the Bahamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's definitely a different experience, but it's a little more familiar, so I'm glad I can be here again,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. Swimming is a sport where you can focus on yourself and do the best race that you can, and that's what I've tried to do over the past couple of days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Alexy of the United States led all 79 swimmers with a time of 47.57 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only the 16 fastest from the heats qualify for the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will also compete in the men’s 50m freestyle in Paris.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have failed to advance in the women's doubles in badminton at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their final group match on Tuesday, the SAR duo lost to Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first game was a closely fought affair before the No 4 seed from China prevailed, 21-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second game was also close with the score tied several times early on, before Liu and Tan put on a late charge to come away 21-15 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did well because we didn't fear them for their ranking. Even when we were trailing by many points during the match, we absolutely didn't give up and we tried to fight point by point," Lianne Yeung said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair finished in third place in Group B with one win and two losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the group and Bulgaria came second, both advancing to the next round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports psychologist says the Olympic Games highlight how athletes need to work on their mental state if they want to perform well, and not just their physical fitness and sporting skill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Karen Lo, whose clients include SAR Olympic athletes, on Tuesday said athletes need the mental discipline to maintain composure and focus, even when things aren't going their way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to remain calm and focused when you're losing, and also even when you're leading by a couple of points because you want to continue to lead as well. These are skills that are not so related to your fitness level, or physique, or your strategy and tactics. This is more on the mental side of the game," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that athletes may face extra pressures, such as performance anxiety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Athletes are human beings, they struggle with their mental health just like anyone else in Hong Kong. However, their identity is an athlete, they might feel extremely nervous handling expectations from the local community, and also coaches, that might be unique from everyone else," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that athletes can make use of psychological workshops and sessions to identify the underlying reasons for any confidence issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun's hopes of capturing a medal at the Paris Olympics came to an end on Tuesday, after he finished last among six competitors in the first quarter-final of the men's rowing single sculls event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clocked in a time of seven minutes 13.7 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew I was competing against seeded players in the quarter-finals, so I tried to catch up with them in the first 500 metres," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it would be challenging, but I didn't want to give up. The process was difficult and I had only myself, from preparing for the match to drawing up a race plan."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will row again in the C and D semi-finals on Wednesday.

  Wang Wenbin, the Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, on Tuesday met Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived in the capital Phnom Penh as part of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Laos and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the meeting, Wang noted that he had earlier sent off another delegation led by former chief executive and vice-chairman of the nation's top political advisory body, CY Leung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With Lee and Leung visiting at the same time, this shows that Hong Kong attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperation with Cambodia and promoting China-Cambodia relations," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The chief executive's visit will certainly promote mutually beneficial cooperation between Cambodia and Hong Kong, and play a role in further boosting China-Cambodia relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE, for his part, stressed the importance of fostering ties between governments, and allowing companies to do business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of his departure to Cambodia from Laos, Lee congratulated and praised fencer Edgar Cheung and swimmer Siobhan Haughey for their outstanding performances at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said their performances showed the excellence of Hong Kong's athletes, while reiterating the government's commitment to sports development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese leaders signalled on Tuesday that the stimulus measures needed to reach this year's economic growth target will be directed at consumers, pointing to a "batch of incremental policy steps" to boost domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Politburo pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a "proactive" fiscal policy, and reiterated the need for a "prudent" monetary framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency reported "the meeting stressed that it is necessary to focus on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand, and the focus of economic policy should be more to benefit people's livelihood and promote consumption".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said policies should increase residents' income "through multiple channels" and enhance the "ability and willingness" of low- and middle-income groups to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said economic measures should improve elderly and childcare, and "weave a dense and solid social security net".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No specific steps were announced, but the leadership gave instructions for a "timely launch [of] a batch of incremental policy measures".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also warned that "adverse effects brought about by current changes in the external environment are increasing", while there are "many risks and hidden dangers in key areas".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have announced various measures in recent months to boost the economy. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Foreign Ministry's Office in Hong Kong said respect is key to developing sound relationships between the SAR and foreign governments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Commissioner Cui Jianchun on Tuesday said sanctions imposed by the West on the territory disrespect the city's authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to build a good, sound relationship, we have to respect each other. That means every country has to respect the Hong Kong SAR government. And whatever things happen, you cannot use your national law to become a long-arm jurisdiction to impose sanctions to other nations, to other individual companies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said none of the consuls-general he's met in Hong Kong were against the city having its national security laws, and that a majority of them supported the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commissioner also urged foreign governments to support Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said he hopes he could work with the SAR administration during his tenure on the accession bid, as the move would be conducive to the city's development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the recent visit to China by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, where he discussed the war with Russia with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and met Chief Executive John Lee in Hong Kong, the commissioner said the SAR government is sticking to international law and international norms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government, Hong Kong people love to support the peaceful dialogue, peaceful communication as quickly as possible... and to relieve, also to alleviate, to reduce the suffering of the people and to try to do good things for the international community," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui, a former ambassador, was appointed to the office in April this year, filling the post after his predecessor Liu Guangyuan was named a deputy director of the liaison office.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Tramways is celebrating its 120th anniversary, saying it aims to continue to contribute to the public transport system, attract more tourists and remain meaningful to locals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trams transport around 150,000 passengers daily, representing over 10 percent of the Hong Kong Island population and making it one of the busiest tram networks in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Managing Director of Hong Kong Tramways Paul Tirvaudey on Tuesday said the company seeks to balance modernisation of the system with preserving its identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our point is not to insert a modern tram... it is to insert modern components into the tram to keep the appearance while making a more modern system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said passenger numbers are gradually recovering post-Covid, but they are still down 10-15 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a celebration ceremony, Tirvaudey emphasised the firm's commitment to sustainability, saying it is building trams that are 30 percent more energy efficient, reusing old parts for new trams to create a circular economy, and conducting carbon footprint assessments to identify areas for improvement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are green. We are among the best in the class, but we work to be even better in the future," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Early morning landslides in India triggered by pounding monsoon rains have killed at least 10 people with hundreds more feared trapped under the earth, officials said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The southern coastal state of Kerala has been battered by torrential downpours, and the collapse of a key bridge at the disaster site in Wayanad district has hampered rescue efforts, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 have been confirmed dead so far, a district official in Wayanad told AFP on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army said it had deployed more than 200 soldiers to the area to assist state security forces and fire crews in search and rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of people are suspected to have been trapped," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had assured the Kerala government of "all possible help" with the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured," he said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More rainfall and strong winds were forecast in Kerala on Tuesday, the state's disaster management agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in parliament, said he was "deeply anguished" by the disaster. "I hope those still trapped are brought to safety soon," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they also bring destruction every year in the form of landslides and floods. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey's success in the water has inspired many of the SAR's young people to take up the sport, but there simply aren't enough public pools to go around, according to one expert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Swimming Teachers' Association, Li Chi-leung, told an RTHK programme on Tuesday that a lack of swimming pools means many grassroots children are unable to participate in the sport because it's out of their families' financial reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Parents want their children to learn look for swimming classes in the community, most of which are set up by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. But the department doesn't offer many classes, and during the winter there are very few classes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they sign up for private classes, it's very expensive to book a pool and private classes do have to make a profit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the government should build more indoor pools and keep them open all year round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey won bronze in the women's 200m freestyle final in Paris, becoming the first Hong Kong athlete to win three Olympic medals following her two at the Tokyo Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World Triathlon on Tuesday said the Paris Olympics men's triathlon event will be postponed by a day, after tests showed the water quality in the River Seine was not up to standard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The development means Hong Kong's Jason Ng is now scheduled to compete on Wednesday at 4.45pm. He was originally going to race at 2pm on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tests carried out in the Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held," World Triathlon said in a statement, adding the International Olympic Committee, Meteo France and Paris officials were involved in conducting the water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control, such as the rain which fell over Paris on 26 and 27 July, can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's triathlon event will also take place on Wednesday, with World Triathlon saying both events are subject to future water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris based hydrologist had earlier told RTHK that rainstorms in the 24 hours before a swimming event in the Seine could wash storm water off the land surfaces around the city, bringing pollution with it.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Monday following a choppy session to open a news-jammed week that includes major tech earnings and a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Investors are adopting a wait-and-see posture ahead of quarterly results from Microsoft, Apple and other tech giants, as well as a Wednesday Fed decision, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but could hint at a rate cut at its next meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.1 percent at 40,539.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 5,463, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also won 0.1 percent at 17,370.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech shares have been under pressure in recent weeks after leading the market for the first half of 2024, with investors shifting funds to other sectors due to concerns about excessive valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, McDonald's gained 3.3 percent despite missing analyst estimates as the company vowed to redouble efforts to win over value-focused consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts noted the fast-food chain had fallen 17 percent prior to the results, suggesting the negative news was priced in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's agenda also includes a monthly US employment report for July. (AFP)

 It was another action packed day on Monday at the Olympics in Paris with Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung making history for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung distinguished himself with the successful defence of his Olympic title in the men's individual foil while Haughey won a consecutive medal in the 200 free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China now ranks tenth in the medals table with China third in the tally with five golds thanks to efforts from their divers and shooters. Japan top the table ahead of hosts France.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king Edgar Cheung defended his Olympic gold medal in men's foil in dramatic fashion after making a brilliant comeback in the final match against Italian Filippo Macchi in the early hours of Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian pulled ahead 14-12, but Cheung immediately gained two points to bring the game into a tie-breaker for the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the score tied at 14-14, the fencing got even more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On two occasions, both fencers thought they had won the last point, but the judges said it was too close to rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After three attempts to break the tie, Cheung took home the win for Hong Kong, China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he couldn't believe he's the first athlete to repeat in men's foil in 68 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe [that I've won]...and being the first man to repeat in so long, actually, I really rather can't believe it," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of the best moments in my life. To have a gold medal in France, with a French coach, for me it's a wonderful day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he woke up not feeling too good, but when he fenced, it was different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said coach Greg Koenig told him not to focus on the judges' decisions late in the game, and focus on the next move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach, for his part, said he never doubted that Cheung could overcome his deficit at 12-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three last points, to be honest, I know he can do it. I will stay positive. I will send him my maximum positive energy because I know, three points in a row for him is absolutely nothing," Koenig said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory helped him claim his second gold in as many Games and becomes the first athlete from the SAR to grab consecutive Olympic titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong now has two gold medals in Paris, both in fencing, the most ever won at a single Games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, the Italian Fencing Federation has lodged an official complaint with the International Fencing Federation and the International Olympic Committee over what it considers to be unacceptable refereeing decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation President Paolo Azzi expressed his disappointment at the conclusion of the competition, claiming that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been unfairly denied the gold medal he deserved.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey won a consecutive medal in the women's 200m freestyle, earning bronze on top of the silver she won in Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong star was among the first to turn at the half-way point before her Australian rivals Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus turned up the heat in the second 100 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Callaghan pulled away from Titmus and Haughey in the last lap to win in an Olympic record time of 1 minute, 53.27 seconds, 0.54 seconds ahead of defending champion Titmus who settled for silver while Haughey picked up the bronze in a time of 1 minute, 54.55.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said after the race that her time wasn't as good as she thought it would be, but she's still satisfied with the result, saying the Australian swimmers were really strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said it was a special moment for her because when she won silvers in Tokyo, there were no spectators because of Covid, and she's glad that her parents were among many in the crowd cheering her on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star swimmer also thanked Hongkongers for staying up to support her and other SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you so much for everyone who's been waking up really early to watch our races, our matches and competitions," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really been on social media a lot these past few days, but I've received everyone's messages and all the love and support, so, thank you so much and please keep supporting us because it means the world to us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Haughey's third Olympic medal following the two silvers she won in the 100m and 200m freestyle events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is due to compete in the women's 100m free on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Summer McIntosh set the pool alight at La Defense Arena in Paris, with a commanding victory in the women's 400m individual medley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian won in a time of 4 minutes, 27.71 seconds, ahead of American silver medallist Katie Grimes and her bronze-winning US teammate Emma Weyant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh's triumph comes two days after taking silver behind Australian powerhouse Ariarne Titmus in the 400m freestyle on the meet's opening on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, the men's 200m freestyle a closely fought battle between at least six swimmers in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, it was Romanian teenager David Popovici who powered to the gold medal on Monday, edging Britain's Matthew Richards by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old touched in 1 minute 44.72 seconds ahead of Richards who took silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Luke Hobson took bronze in a frantic finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was Popovici's first Olympic medal after missing out in Tokyo where he came fourth and he also became the first Romanian male to win an Olympic gold in swimming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another gold for Italy as world record holder Thomas Ceccon won the men's 100m backstroke gold at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Xu Jiayu took silver, with 2016 gold medallist Ryan Murphy of the US taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also won silver in the women's 100m breaststroke as Tang Qianting finished just behind Tatjana Smith of South Africa who added the 100 breast title to the 200m gold she won in Tokyo three years ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese men's gymnastic team took home silver at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Tuesday, as two falls from one of the gymnasts in the final round proved to be too costly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan took gold on 259.594 points, a little more than half a point ahead of China. The United States got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China led by more than three points heading into the final round, with Xiao Ruoteng, Su Weide and Zhang Boheng up on the horizontal bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su slipped and lost his grip on the bar twice in his routine, for a subpar score of 11.6. Zhang was unable to make up for the deficit in the last routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China had taken the lead after the first three rotations, with exceptional performances on the rings, led by Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Liu Yang, and strong scores on the horse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan and Zhang then extended the advantage with slick moves on the parallel bars, with Zou getting 16 points on the apparatus, the highest individual score in the entire event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su had a night to forget as his slips also meant the chance at gold faded away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese themselves had to overcome a poor start to the competition to capture gold in the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China snatched bronzes in the same event at both the Tokyo and Rio Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung is through to the final of the men's individual foil after beating his Japanese opponent in the semis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung prevailed against Kazuki Iimura 15-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both fencers started the match with quick points, as they went neck to neck in a gripping semi-final match. Cheung was able to widen the gap and ultimately take the win with seconds still remaining in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said they are here for the gold once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He really could control his emotions. He showed real maturity in his fencing. Whatever the score was, he was really focused so it was amazing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still have one more match. We came here for the gold and we will give the maximum for the gold.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the second fencing medal for Hong Kong, China, given Cheung is guaranteed at least a silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also means Cheung becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to have a chance at defending their Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If he wins, Cheung would be the first man to defend an Olympic foil title since 1956.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will face Italian Filippo Macchi in the final at 4.10am Hong Kong time.

 Hong Kong’s windsurfers were finally able to make some waves in the south of France, with Mui Ma ranking fourth after finishing her first day of Olympic races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma finished sixth and fifth in her two races respectively. There are five races in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her fellow windsurfer Alex Cheng ranked 20th after his first race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s skiff sailors, Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth, remained in second to last place after completing half of their races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The windsurfing competitions were postponed for a day due to a lack of wind down in Marseilles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis stars Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting will play for a mixed doubles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, after losing to North Korea's pair 3-4 in the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an up and down match, with Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong, the lowest seed in this tournament, starting with a bang and taking the first game 3-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong then took the second game 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth-seeded Hong Kong pair then had a 2-1 edge after winning the third game 11-3. But they dropped the next two, 9-11, 9-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall at the South Paris Arena, Doo and Wong went on to win the sixth game 11-9 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's when the North Koreans went on the attack, as they jumped out to a 7-0 lead behind Ri's strong forehand smashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair fought their way back to make it 6-9, before eventually dropping the final game 6-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean giant killers had started the tournament defeating the world number two pair, Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan, in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo will face South Korea's Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon, who lost to China's top-seeded Sun Yingsha and Wang Chuqin in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, Wong said they gave it their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Facing these North Koreans, they're the so-called dark horses. But any team in the final four has to be very good. So actually, when we faced them, we felt we were the dark horses," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So on the table, we fought until the very end, but we failed. We will collect ourselves for the bronze medal match and hopefully we can win a medal for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal match will take place on Tuesday at 7:30pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British TV news presenter Huw Edwards, a household name in Britain, has been charged with three counts of making indecent pictures of children, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edwards, 62, was the BBC's highest paid news presenter and anchored the broadcaster's "BBC News at Ten" bulletin for more than two decades. He resigned in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with three counts of making an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child relating to images found on a child's phone, according to court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat," a London police spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Edwards was arrested on 8 November, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was bailed to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards was one of the main faces at the BBC until his departure, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation, and leading coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He quit on medical advice after allegations emerged that he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing council of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) on Monday expressed disappointment over what it described as  “misjudgments" by management in bypassing the council when it changed the university's emblem two years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After a council meeting to discuss the logo change, chairman John Chai said the whole project cost around HK$4 million, most of which was spent on hiring international branding consultants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the emblem to mark the university’s 60th anniversary in October 2022 drew criticism from students and alumni who were not consulted. The new logo was later shelved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The university council will learn from experience and take appropriate measures to improve university governance and try to avoid a repeat of a similar incident,” Chai told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chai added that the university president Rocky Tuan – who announced in January that he was resigning – should take full responsibility for the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Tuan was unable to attend Monday's council meeting due to a work trip. Tuan will leave his post in January next year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung overcame a partisan home crowd to edge out Enzo Lefort of France for a place in the semi-finals of the men’s individual foil on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lefort took control in the opening stages, with Cheung ending the first round down 3-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete was able to turn it around early in the second round, but the French fencer fought back, leading to a nail-biting back and forth that ended with the second round score at 13-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, knowing he would go out if he lost another point, scored two quick points in an intense final round to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, taking Hong Kong, China into the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When you fence against a guy who is a two-time world champion, who is playing in his hometown with all the public, of course it’s going to be hard, harder than usual but Ka-long found the psychological resources to put the last point, which is amazing regarding to the match, so I am very, very again proud of what he did,” said coach Gregory Koenig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to understand that even when you are tired, you have enough adrenaline to find the resources. You are tired but the psychological is the most important at this point. Even when you have pain everywhere, you have to think ‘OK I have pain, but this is life, this is how it is, I have to do what I know what to do’ and that is what he did in the last two points. The last two points were amazing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Koenig added that his next opponent Kazuki Iimura of Japan would definitely be a challenge, saying the Japanese fencer might be shorter than Cheung, but he moves very quickly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The American restaurant chain Outback Steakhouse announced it will shut down nine of its 19 outlets in Hong Kong. About 300 staff are expected to lose their jobs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outback said the affected eateries are located in Causeway Bay, Central, Mong Kok and other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will stay open until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the chain described it as a difficult business decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We remain committed to Hong Kong market with our 10 branches and will continue to serve customers with the same commitment to quality and excellence that they have come to expect from the Outback brand," the chain added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority said Outback has not made MPF contributions to about 40 employees in May and June, totalling around HK$60,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said it urged the chain to settle outstanding MPF payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority added that it has not received any complaints from Outback staff.

    Djokovic downs Nadal in Olympic blockbuster

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic and Nadal of Spain embrace after their match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763742_1_20240729223953.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic crushed Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in their blockbuster Olympics clash on Monday as the two titans met for the 60th and possibly final time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The showdown between the two most successful men's tennis players in history appeared to be fizzling out before a late fightback from Nadal enabled him to avoid his heaviest-ever defeat by Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very relieved," said Djokovic. "Everything was going my way, I was 6-1, 4-0 up but I played a sloppy service game and gave him chances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic's 31st win in a rivalry that began on the same Roland Garros clay courts in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb added: "I never thought back in 2006 that we'd still be playing each other almost 20 years later."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal admitted Djokovic was the "clear favourite" ahead of their first clash in more than two years, with the Spaniard a shadow of the player who reigned for the best part of two decades at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 14 of Nadal's 22 Grand Slams have come in Paris, the 38-year-old has been plagued by injuries in recent years and he has slumped to 161st in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His participation in the singles in Paris had been in doubt until the last minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic has not had a good season by his stratospherically high standards but the 37-year-old Serbian rose to the occasion in his pursuit of an elusive Olympic gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed raced into a 5-0 lead before Nadal finally got on the board but Djokovic closed out the set and surged 4-0 ahead in the second before Nadal offered some belated resistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal clawed his way back to 4-4 only for Djokovic to break once more, this time making no mistake as he put away his old foe and perhaps brought down the curtain on one of the greatest rivalries in the history of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a bronze medallist on his Olympic debut in 2008, goes on to face Matteo Arnaldi or Dominik Koepfer for a spot in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will turn his focus to the doubles where he is in a dream-team pairing with compatriot Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the reigning men's French Open and Wimbledon champion, takes on Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor later Monday in the singles. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Laos signed 12 MOUs to boost cooperation during Chief Executive John Lee's visit to the Asean member state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in a media briefing in the capital Vientiane on Monday evening as he wrapped his visit to Laos, he said there's room for the two sides to further enhance ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our two-day visit in Laos is fruitful. We have a total of 12 MOUs being exchanged, from trade and economic partnership, investment promotion, Customs collaboration, education exchange, logistics cooperation, to financial services and air services development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, I believe Hong Kong and Laos will have huge potentials and opportunities for cooperation, and there's ample room to grow in terms of trade and people-to-people exchange."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is an ideal platform for Laotian companies to tap into the Greater Bay Area market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that more cooperation between both the business sector between the two places and people-to-people exchange will help produce good benefits to the two peoples," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also thanked Laos for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the visit, he met with the leaders of Laos and visited places such as Vientiane Secondary School where students have been learning Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech at the school, he said Polytechnic University has signed an MOU with the school, offering scholarships to high-achieving students so that they can study at the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also pointed out Hong Kong recently relaxed the visa policy for Laotian talent to work or study in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee will head to Cambodia on Tuesday on the next leg of his three-nation visit which also includes Vietnam.

 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung advanced to the quarter-finals on Monday, after beating Mo Ziwei of China 15-10 in the last-16 of the men’s individual foil at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is ranked third in the world, started out strong earning himself an early three points to put him ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo was able to fight back, but Cheung maintained good defence to put him at an 8-6 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo then bounced back into the action, but he couldn’t overtake the SAR star, who won in two rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will play host France’s Enzo Lefort in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said Cheung has to be prepared to face Lefort and a strong home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He has really the perfect mindset. He is self-confident, he knows he can be strong and this is what I want from him. Now as you can see on the table, he will have to fence Enzo Lefort, which is really the ‘chouchou’ of the French public, so it’s going to be hard,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be like in Rio against the Brazilian guy. He has to face off. If you want to become an Olympic champion, you have to face these kind of matches where you have to fence against one guy plus five thousand people of the public, but he will be prepared for this.”
