 Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth will be the first Hong Kong sailors racing in Olympic 49er competitions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 49er is a two-handed skiff-type high-performance sailing dinghy, which requires the two crew members to work on different roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo told RTHK about their strong bond, which started in 2018 when they paired up.

 The Hong Kong market opened higher on Monday amid an announcement by the mainland central bank to cut two key lending rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 47 points or 0.27 percent at 17,465.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland stocks were mixed on Monday, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index down 0.14 percent to open at 2,978.19 points and the Shenzhen Component Index 0.06 percent higher at 8,908.21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the People's Bank of China announced it was cutting two key rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.35 percent from 3.45 percent previously, while the five-year LPR was reduced by the same margin to 3.85 percent from 3.95 percent .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Arthur Fils came out on top after a gruelling three-set encounter with Alexander Zverev to win the Hamburg Open on Sunday, defeating the hometown player 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/1).
 <br>
  <br/>
  After victory in Lyon last year, it is the 20-year-old's second ATP title as he confirms his position as one of the sport's leading next-gen players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 28 Fils overcame German top seed Zverev on the clay in Hamburg after just over three-and-a-half hours on court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew from the start it was not going to be easy. First set I was taking care of it, I think I had a little but of luck, but playing great. Then second set he managed to play better than me and to raise his level," said Fils during the trophy ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we closed the roof I knew it was going to be just a fight, like a dogfight. You just have to fight until the last point, until the last ball. I've practising for a long time for this kind of moment so I'm really happy to win it." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele said a "sense of calm" helped him win the British Open on Sunday as the American claimed his second major just two months after triumphing at the PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old Californian delivered a faultless, zen-like six-under-par final round at Royal Troon to emerge from a congested leaderboard and clinch the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele finished on nine-under par for the championship, two shots ahead of England's Justin Rose and Billy Horschel of the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele, who registered a major record of 21-under-par to win the PGA at Valhalla in May, is the first player to win two majors in a year since Brooks Koepka in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His victory on the west coast of Scotland completes an American clean sweep of the game's biggest titles in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought (winning the PGA) would help me and it actually did. I had this sense of calm, a calm I didn't have when I played earlier at the PGA," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was telling my caddie Austin (Kaiser) that I felt pretty calm coming down the stretch and he said he was about to puke on the 18th tee."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just told myself to just hit it down there and keep moving along," added the world number three, who described clinching the Open as a "dream come true". (AFP)

    Republicans say Biden should go immediately

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than a dozen Republicans called on US President Joe Biden to step down on Sunday after he ended his re-election bid, saying that his unwillingness to continue to campaign raises questions about his ability to continue to govern.
 <br>
  <br/>
  House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, US Senator JD Vance – the just-nominated running mate of Donald Trump in the November 5 election – and other lawmakers urged the 81-year-old incumbent to step down from office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden insisted in his statement that he would finish his term, which ends January 20, 2025, and fellow Democrats blasted the calls as "ridiculous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough," said Johnson, who is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's fellow Democrats for weeks had called on him to end his campaign after a disastrous June 27 debate against former President Trump in which Biden at times struggled to finish his thoughts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?" Vance tweeted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, including Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin, called on Biden's Cabinet to remove him from office by invoking the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution. Biden's Cabinet, composed of officials hand-picked by the president, is highly unlikely to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the resignation calls, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close associate of Biden, said, "I think that is ridiculous." (Reuters)

    Democrats rally behind VP Harris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kamala Harris hopes to make history as the first Black woman to be US president. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762584_1_20240722052554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many Democrats on Sunday quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After weeks of in-party fighting between Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind her is crucial just over 100 days before November's election. However, there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, not in his initial letter stepping down, but in a separate statement. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, lawmakers including US Senator Patty Murray, and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said on social media platform X. "Democrats – it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris "the American dream personified," noting she was the daughter of immigrants. "She is also toughness personified, rising from my hometown of Oakland, California, to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, others including Pelosi thanked Biden for his patriotism but did not yet throw their support behind Harris or any other candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Senator Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an open process to nominate Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats should have “an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party,” he said. “The debate in the Democratic Party is who can carry on the legacy of President Biden and defeat Trump.” (Reuters)

    Biden quits re-election bid, backs VP Harris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Donald Trump while endorsing Vice President Kamal Harris to replace him as the party's candidate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, in a post on X, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His initial statement had not included an endorsement of Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with an expression of support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major-party ticket in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party's nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's announcement follows a wave of public and private pressure from Democratic lawmakers and party officials to quit the race after his shockingly poor performance in a June 27 televised debate last month against Republican rival Trump, 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump's performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden's fitness for another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party's nomination for reelection since President Lyndon Johnson in March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Harris emerges as the nominee, the move would represent an unprecedented gamble by the Democratic Party: its first Black and Asian American woman to run for the White House in a country that has elected one Black president and never a woman president in more than two centuries of democracy.

    Team orders hand Piastri maiden F1 victory in Hungary

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Oscar Piastri takes the chequered flag in Hungary. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762573_1_20240722011022.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri said he realised a childhood dream on Sunday after claiming his maiden Formula One victory in a whirlpool of mixed emotions and vexed team orders as McLaren claimed an emphatic one-two at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After taking the lead at the start, when he passed pole-sitting team-mate Lando Norris, the 23-year-old Australian pulled clear to control the race until losing out in the pit-stops, when the Briton gained an advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren pitted him first for an 'undercut' to fend off seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes who finished third after surviving a skirmish with Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This resulted in Norris, who had superior pace, inheriting the lead, leading into the closing laps and receiving repeated orders to give back his position – and victory – to Piastri, who was struggling to close the gap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After prolonged strained dialogue on the team radio, Norris agreed to slow down and let Piastri pass him with three laps remaining, despite knowing he was losing a chance to cut substantially into Max Verstappen's lead in the drivers' championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A very special day for me," said Piastri. "This is the day I've dreamed of as a kid, to be standing on the top step of an F1 podium. A bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he was unfazed by the team orders arguments played out over the closing laps as McLaren asked Norris to slow down, preserve his tyres and allow Piastri to catch and pass him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer you leave it, of course, you get a bit nervous, but it was well-executed by the team and it was the right thing to do. I had put myself in the right position at the start," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the different strategies we had, my pace probably wasn't as quick as I would have liked in the last stint, but I was still in the right position to make it happen." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 State media on Sunday said rescuers had found the bodies of ten people swept away by flash floods in Sichuan province, as extreme weather continues in many parts of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official Xinhua news agency said 29 people remained missing after heavy rain triggered the flooding at a village under the city of Ya’an.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers were reported to be using drones, sniffer dogs and life detectors to search for the missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting the scene, Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing called for all-out efforts to rescue the missing. He also said efforts should be increased to prevent secondary disasters, such as mudslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said local authorities across the country should further strengthen preparations for heavy rain and flooding, especially in vulnerable areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Xinhua reported that 15 bodies had now been found after Friday’s collapse of a highway bridge in Shaanxi province. That disaster was also triggered by heavy rain.

    Chinese at more risk from brain complication: study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at the Chinese University's Faculty of Medicine say they’ve found that patients who are of Chinese ethnicity are at higher risk of death if they develop a complication linked to blood thinning treatment for heart disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The study analysed the clinical and imaging data of 232 patients who experienced an intracerebral haemorrhage between 2016 and 2021. It found that 70 percent of Chinese patients had a poor neurological outcome and almost 40 percent died within 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European and American studies, meanwhile, found that only around 50 percent of patients suffered severe neurological disability and there was a 28 percent mortality rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a very impactful finding,” said Dr Bonaventure Ip, an assistant professor of neurology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such a study has never been performed among the Asian or Chinese patients. That is exactly why we need to have a better management strategy for patients [with the disease]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Direct oral anticoagulants are widely used to reduce the risk of stroke, as the drug prevents clots from forming inside blood vessels. However, one in every thousand patients face the risk of developing intracerebral haemorrhage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings were released on Monday, to mark World Brain Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team said people should maintain healthy habits, such as eating a balanced diet, exercise regularly and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption. They say such habits are especially important for people with atrial fibrillation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team also urged people to immediately seek help if they experience symptoms of stroke, including inability to move one side of their limbs, facial asymmetry, drooling of saliva and slurring of speech.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal gets a hug from Nuno Borges after his defeat in the Bastad Open final. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762566_1_20240721222405.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal lost his first final in two years on Sunday as the Spaniard went down 6-3, 6-2 to Portugal's Nuno Borges at the clay-court Bastad Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish tennis great had shown signs of a return to form in Scandinavia as he made an impressive run to the final, just one week before tennis at the Olympic Games gets under way on the clay in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nadal, rather than celebrating his 64th title on the surface and first since Roland Garros 2022, was dominated by Borges as he struggled to find fluency with his serve and ground strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know what to say. I think I was wishing for this moment for a while already," said Borges in his post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's crazy, in tennis it doesn't happen when you expect it sometimes. I know we all wanted Rafa to win, a part of me wished that too, but something even bigger inside of me really pushed through today... I'm just really happy overall. I really don't know what to say, I'm very emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges was the first to make headway in the match when he broke the Spaniard's serve to go 3-1 up, with Nadal saving break points before overcooking a forehand down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 14-time French Open winner struck back immediately on the Borges serve, earning two break-back points before the Portuguese dumped a forehand into the net from inside the service box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But neither player could quite grab the ascendancy in the first set as Borges quickly ran up a 0-40 lead in the next service game, converting his second break point with a perfectly executed drop shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal was struggling to find his first serve but managed to hold just his second service game of the opening set to force Borges to serve one more time. The world number 51 kept his nerve to do just that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old showed signs of his old self serving at deuce in the first game of the second set with a booming forehand winner down the line, before he eventually held but that was one of the few highlights for Nadal on the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges then struck at 2-2 as he broke Nadal's serve for the first time in the second set and fourth time overall to edge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old followed it up by winning the next three games, sealing a maiden career title in his first-ever match-up against the former world number one with an ace. (AFP)

    Paris rejects 4,000 Games accreditation requests

<div class="itemFullText">
 French security services rejected more than 4,000 applications for Paris 2024 Olympics accreditations, including over espionage and cyberattack concerns, the country's caretaker interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gerald Darmanin said French authorities have so far checked close to one million accreditation requests for the Games that kick off on July 26 and had rejected 4,340 people, some over radical Islamist connections or suspicion of being foreign spies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to one hundred were rejected over espionage fears or concerns they were agents trying to get an accreditation using a different profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are probably not there to carry out attacks. But in addition to intelligence and traditional espionage, there is the possibility of accessing entry points into computer networks to carry out a cyberattack," Darmanin told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they had applied as journalists or technical staff and their countries of origin were Russia and Belarus, among others, which he did not name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we refused a large number of 'journalists' who claimed to cover the Games. On the other hand, we accepted the presence of Russians who work for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We apply the precautionary principle," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian journalists have been allowed to get accredited for the Games and have already arrived in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris will be deploying 45,000 security personnel to guarantee the safety of the Games and its unique opening ceremony along the river Seine where athletes will float on barges past hundreds of thousands of spectators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers have reduced the initial number of spectators from 600,000 to around 300,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To our knowledge, we have no known threat to the security of the Olympic Games," Darmanin said. "In the past days I did a new reconnaissance by boat on the Seine with the police. I confirm that the ceremony will take place in the format announced by the President of the Republic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the flow of the river and the low risk of bad weather, there is – to date – no identified threat to the Games. Neither our intelligence services nor the foreign services with which we coordinate have detected any foreign threat. But you have to stay very humble and focused." (Reuters)

    Bangladesh scraps most job quotas that sparked riots

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bangladesh's top court scales back job quotas that triggered days of deadly unrest. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762546_1_20240721170912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh’s top court on Sunday scaled back a controversial quota system for government job applicants after it led to nationwide unrest and deadly clashes between police and protesters that killed scores of people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court in its verdict ordered 93 percent of government jobs to be allocated on a merit-based system, leaving the remaining seven percent for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971 and other categories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the system reserved 30 percent of such jobs for the relatives of war veterans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's verdict comes after weeks of demonstrations — mostly led by students — that turned deadly on Tuesday after protesters began clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the week, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters who filled the streets and university campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporadic clashes in some parts of Dhaka, the capital, were reported on Saturday but it was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladeshi authorities haven’t shared any official numbers of those killed and injured, but the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported Saturday that at least 103 people have died so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the court's hearing, soldiers patrolled cities across the South Asian country, while a nationwide curfew and an internet blackout remained in force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the curfew will be relaxed from 3 pm to 5 pm on Sunday for people to run essential errands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government has declared Sunday and Monday as public holidays, with only emergency services allowed to operate. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Correctional Services Department (CSD) on Sunday said a 60-year-old man, who was remanded in custody at Pak Sha Wan Correctional Institution, had died at a public hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 60-year-old was accused of indecent conduct towards a child under the age of 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said he was suffering from liver cirrhosis, a condition caused by long-term liver damage resulting in scarring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was sent to hospital 10 days ago and was pronounced dead at 9 am on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CSD has informed the police and a death inquest will be conducted by the Coroner's Court.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US presidential candidate Donald Trump, holding his first campaign rally since surviving an assassination attempt a week ago, rejected concerns he was a threat to America's democratic system, telling the crowd: "I took a bullet for democracy."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I'm not an extremist at all," the newly-crowned Republican presidential nominee continued at the rally in swing state Michigan, dismissing his reported links to Project 2025, a manifesto from the Heritage Foundation that has been characterised by opponents as an authoritarian, right-wing wish list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he mocked the rival Democratic Party, roiled by unprecedented pressure for US President Joe Biden to abandon his re-election bid, amid concerns over his age and fitness to serve, if re-elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have no idea who their candidate is...this guy [Biden] goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That's democracy," Trump told the 12,000-strong crowd of supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fiery, but typically rambling speech, the Republican riffed on his hardline immigration views, espoused falsehoods about migrant crime, and repeated his baseless claim that Democrats "rigged" the 2020 election. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New guidelines on the corporate governance of sports associations are expected to be unveiled in mid-September, Hong Kong's sports bosses said on Sunday, stressing they were not trying to pinpoint any shortcomings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China has been conducting a review of the corporate governance of national sports associations in the SAR following an audit report in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary-general of the federation, said the sports governing body had submitted a plan to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not about fault-finding, picking out what is wrong. We always look at our national sports associations as our affiliates. They need our support, and what is right should stay, what is wrong should be changed. We need to keep up with the times. Times have changed and what's appropriate in the past may not be nowadays," Yang told a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[By doing so,] we hope the selection of athletes can meet our current requirements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Kenneth Fok said it's important for the sports governing body to conduct a "health check".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he urged people not to question the governance of the entire sports sector based on isolated incidents, saying that a majority of associations and organisations under the governing body had been able to promote sports development professionally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the upcoming Paris Olympics, Fok, who is also the federation's vice-president, said he believed there would not be blunders involving the national anthem at the Games as there were procedures in place to ensure the correct song was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe there will not be any mistakes at the Olympics, because it is the most sought-after event around the world. The organising committee would arrange for us to verify the national anthem and flags, and the whole process would require signatures," Fok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have to tell our athletes that some audience members are very enthusiastic and they will bring regional and national flags to the venues. But sometimes, they may have the wrong versions. So we have urged athletes not to take the flags given to them, because it would become their responsibility once they take the flags."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending 35 athletes to Paris, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fok called on the public to support them regardless of whether they win a medal or not, saying he was confident in the athletes' performance at the Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of a book fair in Wan Chai reminded exhibitors to comply with event regulations and all applicable laws in Hong Kong, including the national security law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Publisher Bbluesky, which is one of the exhibitors at the book fair, told RTHK on Saturday it was reminded by the Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which organised the book fair, to remove five titles from its booth, citing complaints and the perceived "sensitive" nature of their content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the books was one about media ethics by seasoned journalist Allan Au, and another written by former lawmaker and ex-prisoner Shiu Ka-chun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boundary Bookstore also said it removed four titles from its booth, after receiving the same reminder from the HKTDC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have the absolute and exclusive authority to determine our participation in the book fair, and what kinds of books we can have in the booth.They're exercising their rights, but it's a bit too stringent. It's also a bit hasty, because they only ask us to remove those books verbally - without providing any documentation," Leanne Liu of Boundary Bookstore told RTHK on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to questions from RTHK, a spokesperson for the HKTDC said the council would handle any complaints regarding suspected violations of event regulations in accordance with procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added the HKTDC would request exhibitors to stop displaying and selling the items in question when necessary.

    N Korea resumes trash balloon flights: S Korea

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korea says North Korea has resumed sending balloons carrying trash across the border into the South. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762522_1_20240721115803.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean officials said North Korea launched more balloons likely carrying trash towards the South on Sunday, days after Seoul restarted blaring anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts across the border in retaliation for the North’s repeated balloon campaigns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Cold War-style psychological battle between the two Koreas is adding to tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the rivals threatening stronger steps against each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North Korean balloons were flying north of Seoul, the South Korean capital, after crossing the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the public should be alert for falling objects and report to police and military authorities if they see any balloons on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea’s latest balloon-flying is the ninth of its kind since late May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has floated more than 2,000 balloons to drop waste paper, scraps of cloth, cigarette butts, waste batteries and even manure on South Korea, though they have so far caused no major damage in South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has said the balloons were launched in response to South Korean activists sending political leaflets to the North via their own balloons. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong should strengthen its online sales sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said online retail sales have surged nearly 60 percent between 2020 and 2023, reaching HK$32.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the growth, Chan noted that online sales in Hong Kong only accounted for eight percent of total retail sales, lower than the 28 percent seen on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was providing support to local small and medium enterprises to expand their business opportunities, by enhancing their popularity on mainland online platforms and gaining a deeper understanding of the online sales market in the rest of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the Trade Development Council would organise the first Hong Kong Shopping Festival next month, to help local enterprises enter the mainland market and revitalise Hong Kong brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 230 brands will have the opportunity to showcase their products, ranging from groceries to cosmetic items, on mainland online sales platforms during the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locally, Chan said three large-scale exhibitions - the book fair, sports and leisure expo, and a snack-themed exhibition - had attracted 760 exhibitors, serving as important promotion platforms for businesses in the city.

    Airports start to return to normal after global outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Planes were gradually taking off again on Saturday after global airlines, banks and media were thrown into turmoil by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Airport Authority said most systems are operating normally again, but contingency plans remain in place, and mainland state media said Beijing's airports had not been affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passenger crowds had swelled at airports on Friday as dozens of flights were cancelled after an update to a programme operating on Microsoft Windows crashed systems worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday, officials said the situation had returned virtually to normal in airports across Germany and France, as Paris prepared to welcome millions for the Olympic Games starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple US airlines and airports across Asia said they had resumed operations, with check-in services restored in Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand, and mostly back to normal in India, Indonesia and at Singapore's Changi Airport as of Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft estimated Saturday that 8.5 million Windows devices were affected in the global IT crash, adding that the number amounted to less than one percent of all Windows machines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services", it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft said the issue began at 1900 GMT on Thursday, affecting Windows users running the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Saturday blog post, CrowdStrike said it had released an update on Thursday night that had caused a system crash and the infamous "blue screen of death" fatal error message.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem, and the company's boss, George Kurtz, told US news channel CNBC he wanted to "personally apologise to every organisation, every group and every person who has been impacted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company also said it could take a few days for things to fully get back to normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's National Health Service was hobbled by the crash on Friday, preventing doctors from accessing patient records and booking appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "majority of systems... are now coming back online in most areas, however they are still running slightly slower than usual", an NHS spokesperson said, warning of disruption continuing into next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media companies were also hit, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its Friday morning news broadcasts. Australia's ABC also reported major difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian, British and German authorities warned of an increase in scam and phishing attempts following the outage, including people offering to help reboot computers and asking for personal information or credit card details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks in Kenya and Ukraine reported issues with their digital services, some mobile phone carriers were disrupted and customer services in a number of companies went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of this outage is unprecedented, and will no doubt go down in history," said Junade Ali of Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology, adding that the last incident approaching the same scale was in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some airports halted all flights, in others airline staff resorted to manual check-ins for passengers, leading to long lines and frustrated travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of US flights were grounded, although airlines later said they were re-establishing their services and working through the backlog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said Friday that "our understanding is that flight operations have resumed across the country, although some congestion remains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's largest airline Indigo said Saturday that operations had been "resolved", adding in a statement on X that the process of resuming normal operations would "extend into the weekend".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Low-cost carrier AirAsia said it was still trying to get back online and had been "working around the clock towards recovering its departure control systems".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said the issue was "not the result of or related to a cyberattack". (AFP)

Image: Courtesy of the HKO" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762502_1_20240721064733.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Monday morning said it expects the Standby Signal No 1 to stay in force until at least noon, though it's unlikely to issue a higher warning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number one signal was issued at 10.40pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of 4.45am on Monday, Tropical Storm Prapiroon was predicted to skirt more than 500 kilometres to the southwest of Hong Kong before moving away. It made landfall over Hainan Island at about 1.30am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unless Prapiroon intensifies significantly, the chance of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals will be rather low," the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with Prapiroon are affecting the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary, the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locally, winds were occasionally strong offshore and on high ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public have been advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile another tropical cyclone, Gaemi, is expected to move towards the seas east of Taiwan and intensify significantly in the next couple of days. It's expected to bring very hot weather with a few showers to Hong Kong in the middle of the week.

    Horschel leads Open one shot ahead of chasing pack

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Billy Horschel goes into the final day at Royal Troon just one shot in front. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762497_1_20240721041942.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American Billy Horschel leads the British Open at four under par heading into Sunday's final round after torrential rain and a swirling wind at Royal Troon blew the challenge for the Claret Jug wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Horschel leads by one from a group of six, featuring USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, South Africa's Thriston Lawrence and Americans Sam Burns and Russell Henley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler is just one shot further back at two under after battling to an even par round of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 12 players are within four shots of the lead for what promises to be a fascinating final round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader Shane Lowry had a day to forget as the 2019 champion crumbled in the sodden conditions to collapse from eight under par after seven holes to one under by the end of his round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Horschel was one of the big movers in a round that had allowed for lower scoring earlier in the day before the wind and rain picked up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting at two under, Horschel produced a sublime four-under 32 on the front nine thanks to birdies at four, six, seven and nine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bogey followed at 11 before another dropped shot at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown, ranked 272 in the world, had been set to lead heading into the final round until a double bogey at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he and Rose remain in the hunt to become the first English winner since Nick Faldo in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry began the day with a two-shot lead and extended that to three with a birdie at the par-five fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Irishman's round began to come off the rails with a double bogey at the 130-yard Postage Stamp eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worse was to come as five bogeys in eight holes on the back nine dropped Lowry back into ninth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh from his maiden major win at the USPGA, Schauffele is eyeing another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three moved to five under at one stage before bogeys at 11 and 18 knocked him back to three under after a round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll let myself dream tonight," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler is also right in the mix to win his third major and win for a seventh time in 15 starts this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A birdie at the third got the American off to a fine start but he then played the next 13 holes in two over before picking up a shot at the 17th to remain ominously poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The back nine, I think that was probably the hardest nine holes that I'll ever play," said Scheffler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence, Burns and Henley made the most of the benign early morning conditions to shoot through the pack to three under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence and Burns posted six-under 65s, while Henley made 66 to move into contention before the leaders had to face the worst of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time major champion Justin Thomas and former Masters winner Adam Scott also impressed to move to level par and remain on the fringes of the battle for the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the challenge from the big names on the breakaway Liv circuit failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jon Rahm slipped back to two over, while Brooks Koepka is back at eight over after a 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the loudest cheers of the week so far was reserved for Kim Si-woo after he produced the longest hole-in-one in British Open history on the 17th that brought him back to five over for the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was not doing very well, and then I was feeling terrible for my shots the last couple days. Then finally I got the best golf shot I've ever had this week," said the South Korean. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal reached his first final since winning the 2022 French Open, defeating Croatian qualifier Duje Ajdukovic in a three-set tussle in Bastad on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after his four-hour quarter-final victory, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was again tested to the limit by Ajdukovic, the world number 130 who had won just two tour-level matches before this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard rebounded from dropping the opening set to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, returning to the final of a tournament he won as a teenager in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will play Portuguese seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on Sunday as he goes in search of the 93rd singles title of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most recent triumph came two years ago at Roland Garros, when he won the tournament for a record-extending 14th time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal is using the event in Bastad as a tune-up for the Paris Olympics, where the tennis will be played on the clay at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762491_1_20240721013834.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall leader Tadej Pogacar won for a fifth time on this Tour de France on Saturday, moving to the brink of a third title, as defending champion Jonas Vingegaard came second and Remco Evenepoel dropped around a minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just Sunday's concluding time trial to come, two-time champion Pogacar has a five minute 14-second lead over Vingegaard as he effectively made sure of becoming the first man in 26 years to capture the Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's action culminated on the tough Col de Couillole climb where Evenepoel attacked Vingegaard in an attempt to take second place overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead he himself dropped around 53sec on the Dane, making it less likely the Belgian can claim second place after Sunday's time trial, where he is favourite for the stage win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel did however virtually guarantee third place overall and the white jersey as best young rider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic champion Richard Carapaz, regarded as the most combative rider on the 2024 Tour, will win the climb points jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carapaz came third on Saturday, won a stage and even took the yellow jersey for a day early in the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 3,498km on this 2024 Tour there remains just 34, a challenging run along the narrow, undulating corniche between the principality of Monaco, where many in the peloton live, and the French Riviera town of Nice. (AFP)

    Yemen's Houthi rebels say Israeli strikes hit Hodeida

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli warplanes struck the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida on Saturday, a day after a Houthi drone attack killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, the rebels said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a "brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Axios news outlet cited US and Israeli officials as saying that Israel carried out the strikes in retaliation for a Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi attack on Friday penetrated Israel's vaunted air defences and killed a civilian in a Tel Aviv apartment building, drawing Israeli threats of retaliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi-run health ministry said there were deaths and injuries in the Hodeida strikes but it did not give a toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Al Masirah television, it said several people suffered "serious burns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage aired by Al Masirah, which has not been independently verified, showed a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness in Hodeida reported hearing several large explosions and seeing smoke over the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel pumps across the city closed following the attack, the correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hodeida has been hard hit by a series of strikes carried out by Britain and the United States since January in response to attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis have attacked at least 88 commercial vessels since November in a campaign they say targets Israeli-linked shipping in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza war. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris claimed pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday ahead of Oscar Piastri as McLaren celebrated their first front row lock-out in over a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen took third in qualifying to start Sunday's race on the second row with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz for company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's under pressure teammate Sergio Perez crashed out in the first session, triggering a red flag and increasing pressure on his job as the Dutch driver's number two at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Ricciardo, a former winner at the circuit, produced a late flash of speed once Q1 resumed to top the times in his RB from Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes with the seven-time champion's teammate George Russell the big name absentee from Q2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris led the pack into the top-10 shoot out, with Hamilton, who broke his lengthy winless run at Silverstone last time out, sneaking through with the slowest time of the middle leg of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuki Tsunoda ended up in a wall in his RB, forcing a second red flag with just two minutes left and Norris and Piastri provisionally locking out the front row for McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen had to sit out the conclusion of qualifying when it resumed after Tsunoda's stricken RB was removed due to an issue with his car as McLaren sealed the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton is on the third row after the fifth fastest time ahead of Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari, Aston Martin duo Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll, with Ricciardo and Tsunoda completing the top 10.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 at 10.40 pm, as the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remains rather loose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tropical depression is expected to strengthen slightly and adopt a more northwesterly track during the day. The Standby Signal No 1 will remain in force at least until 5 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is now centred within about 700 kilometres of Hong Kong and may still affect us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with it and the southwest monsoon are covering the central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the present forecast, the tropical cyclone will intensify and gradually take a more northwesterly track, moving in the general direction to the vicinity of Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under its influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later tomorrow. There will be swells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.

    Bangladesh army on streets as police shoot protesters

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The military has been deployed to enforce a nationwide curfew. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762476_1_20240720212531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Soldiers were patrolling Bangladeshi cities on Saturday to quell growing civil unrest sparked by student demonstrations, with riot police firing on protesters who defied a government curfew.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's violence has killed at least 123 people so far, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, and poses a monumental challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government curfew went into effect at midnight and the premier's office asked the military to deploy troops after police again failed to subdue widespread mayhem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The army has been deployed nationwide to control the law and order situation," said armed forces spokesman Shahdat Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The curfew will remain in effect until at least 10:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday, private broadcaster Channel 24 reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Streets in the capital Dhaka were almost deserted at daybreak, with troops on foot and in armoured personnel carriers patrolling the sprawling megacity of 20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But thousands returned to the streets later in the day in the residential neighbourhood of Rampura, with police firing at the crowd and wounding at least one person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our backs are to the wall," protester Nazrul Islam, 52, said at the scene. "There's anarchy going on in the country... They are shooting at people like birds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals have reported a growing number of gunshot deaths since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of thousands of people" had battled police across the capital on Friday, said police spokesman Faruk Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At least 150 police officers were admitted to hospital. Another 150 were given first aid treatment," he said, adding that two officers had been beaten to death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protesters torched many police booths... Many government offices were torched and vandalised."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said that another two police officers were killed on Saturday, while four people admitted to intensive care succumbed to their injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more protesters were killed in the industrial town of Savar on Dhaka's outskirts, a major centre of Bangladesh's garment exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enam Medical College Hospital spokesman Zahidur Rahman confirmed the latter deaths, adding that "nine people came here with bullet wounds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, said that two of its leaders had been arrested since Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a planned diplomatic tour but abandoned her plans after a week of escalating violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has cancelled her Spain and Brazil tours due to the prevailing situation," said her press secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits families loyal to Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the first deaths on Tuesday, protesters have begun demanding Hasina leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not about the rights of the students anymore," said business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, at the scene of the Rampura protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are here as the general public now," he added. "Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre Prakash of Crisis Group said the lack of competitive elections since Hasina took office had led to mounting public frustration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With no real alternative at the ballot box, discontented Bangladeshis have few options besides street protests to make their voices heard," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rising death toll is a shocking indictment of the absolute intolerance shown by the Bangladeshi authorities to protest and dissent," Babu Ram Pant of Amnesty International said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities imposed a nationwide internet shutdown on Thursday that remains in effect, severely hampering communication in and out of Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government websites remain offline and major newspapers including the Dhaka Tribune and Daily Star have been unable to update their social media platforms since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh Television, the state broadcaster, also remains offline after its Dhaka headquarters was set on fire by protesters the same day. (AFP)

    Former world snooker champion Reardon dies aged 91

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world champion Ray Reardon, the coal miner who dominated snooker in the 1970s, has died at the age of 91.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Welshman Reardon had previously been diagnosed with cancer and passed away on Friday night, his wife Carol confirmed on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91," a World Snooker Tour statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jimmy White, one of snooker's most popular players, said on X: "Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978, earning an MBE in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed 'Dracula' after playing a session of the 1974 World Championship final in a cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket, Reardon rose to prominence as snooker became a popular sport in Britain thanks to the Pot Black television programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most," Reardon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He battled the flamboyant Alex Higgins in a long-running rivalry with the "Hurricane" that included an epic 18-15 defeat in the 1982 World Championship final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number one worked as a coal miner and was also a police officer for eight years before taking snooker by storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was fortunate to survive a mining accident when a 12-foot girder and a deluge of rubble crashed down on him while he was building a pit lane, leaving him trapped for three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right," he wrote in his autobiography.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon retired in 1991 at the age of 58 but remained in the snooker world, helping Ronnie O'Sullivan as a consultant during his run to the 2004 world title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Welsh Open trophy was named in Reardon's honour in 2016. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said young people from Hong Kong can play a key role in the nation's technological development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong said people in Hong Kong now had a better understanding of the country, as patriotic education had been integrated into their daily lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hoped the territory's young people can use their knowledge of technology to offer more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a relatively strong foundation in technology, and has many high-quality tech talents who love the country and Hong Kong," he said at an awards ceremony honouring the work of teenagers in aerospace innovation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an important driving factor in the country's development into an innovative nation... I hope Hong Kong teenagers can reach the peak of technology through their hard work and ambition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the country had high hopes that Hong Kong would develop into an international innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authorities will continue their efforts to nurture the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology is the primary productive force; talent is the primary opportunity; and innovation is the primary driving force," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government attaches great importance to the development of innovation and technology, making every effort to cultivate local talent and increase investment in the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that a Hong Kong resident had been selected for the national manned space programme, and he hopes more young people can aim to join developments in the national aerospace industry.

    Development chief welcomes approval of San Tin plan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn has welcomed a decision by town planners to approve zoning plans for San Tin Technopole, a project that will see the creation of an information and technology hub in an area that now contains fish ponds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Linn said the administration was now looking at ways to speed up the development process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Town Planning Board gave its approval on Friday, saying the decision was made after considering the views of various stakeholder groups, government responses, as well as hours of internal discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the majority of its members agreed the technopole is strategically important for development of the SAR’s technology sector, given its proximity to the Shenzhen IT zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Linn said the administration may speed up the work by selling plots at the same time as carrying out land formation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why is it beneficial if we can sell the land while land formation is under way? The developers who buy the land can immediately start working on building plans. This eliminates the need for everyone to wait for each other," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the administration will apply for funding from the Legislative Council's Finance Committee, saying that if land formation work can commence by the end of this year, the first batch of formed land could be ready in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about what conservation work would be conducted, given that some 90 hectares of fish ponds will need to be reclaimed under the development plan, Linn said the impact is less significant than it seems, saying that more than half of the fish ponds affected are already abandoned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development minister reiterated that the administration will stick to its promise and build a 338-hectare wetland conservation park alongside the technology hub as compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Science Park also welcomed the Town Planning Board's decision, saying the technology hub will provide additional space for research and collaboration between Hong Kong and the rest of Greater Bay Area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 State media reports say 12 people have been confirmed dead after a highway bridge partially collapsed amid downpours on Friday night in northwestern Shaanxi province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official Xinhua news agency says sudden heavy rain and flash floods caused the collapse in the city of Shangluo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said five vehicles that had plunged into the river below had been recovered as of Saturday morning. Rescue operations were continuing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua said at least 31 people remained missing. It reported that 17 cars and eight trucks had fallen into the river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Friday, officials in another city in Shaanxi, Baoji, said five people had been confirmed dead and eight others were missing following torrential rain earlier in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the city had suffered record daily rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.

    CS says govt in touch with Microsoft over outages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Saturday said the government is closely monitoring ongoing problems caused by Friday's global technology outage involving Microsoft systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech outage disrupted operations around the world on Friday, including halting flights and causing difficulties for the banking, health and media sectors in many countries. The problems have been blamed on a faulty software update issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that the SAR government's own computers were not affected, but officials were concerned and had been in touch with Microsoft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Chan said his deputy, Warner Cheuk, is monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government's computer system is not affected. The problem only affected particular airlines... But we're paying close attention to the incident, and we hope it returns to normal as soon as possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a problem affecting the whole world and it's an internal issue of the company. Hong Kong is not the only place affected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Airport Authority said operations at the Hong Kong airport had fully returned to normal on Saturday, with airlines' travellers registration systems restored. That followed the implementation of contingency procedures on Friday, including manual check-ins in some cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some flights scheduled for Saturday remained cancelled, including 20 from the Hong Kong Express.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some travellers arrived early at the airport on Saturday, with one getting there four hours ahead of her flight to Fukuoka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were afraid there would be a lot of people at the airport... but it's not the airline's problem, so I won't blame them," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist said his flight, scheduled for Friday night, was delayed for more than 17 hours, and he was furious about the arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only found out my flight was delayed after I waited at the airport for two hours. There's no compensation. They only allowed me to cancel the ticket. I'm very unsatisfied. I won't choose this airline anymore," he said.

    No rush to replace departed overseas judges: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Saturday said the Judiciary is in no rush to replace overseas judges who are departing the SAR's top court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two British jurists said last month that they were stepping down as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal, while a Canadian member has said she will not extend her term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked on a radio programme how the judges would be replaced, Lam said there were "no vacancies" right now and they would seek new members at an appropriate time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't rely on non-permanent or overseas judges to handle our daily work. This is not our aim... but we hope to keep this system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If some venerable overseas judges take part in our cases, it will have positive effects on the development of our common law system, helping us become internationalised and maintain high standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US congressional committee and commission earlier wrote to the Washington government, demanding it impose sanctions on SAR government officials, judges, prosecutors and police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there's nothing new with the calls for sanctions, describing the attacks as vague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are criticising ongoing judicial proceedings. They intend to interfere in our judicial proceedings or put pressure on our judges... We are most alert about this, and I feel disgusted," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the duties of Hong Kong courts would not be affected by calls for sanctions on judges.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Saturday that it would issue the Standby Signal No 1 at 10.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remained rather loose, though squally showers were covering central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm is expect to take a northwesterly track towards Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said that under the storm's influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days. Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shores and refrain from engaging in water sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Macau's forecaster issued Tropical Cyclone Signal No 1 on Saturday morning, saying it was expected to remain in force for the whole day. The meteorological bureau said it would consider issuing Signal No 3 during the day on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters say another tropical cyclone over the western North Pacific will move towards the seas near Taiwan in the next few days.

    "Govt not obliged to help displaced flat owners"

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"Govt not obliged to help displaced flat owners"' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762415_1_20240720180506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said the government isn’t obliged to provide extra help to flat owners who are forced to sell their homes under legal changes that will make it easier to redevelop old buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under changes approved by the Legislative Council on Thursday, the proportion of owners who have to agree to a redevelopment plan will fall to as little as 65 percent for properties at least 70 years old, instead of the previous 80 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said such deals were a matter for developers and flat owners, not the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The compulsory sales regime is to facilitate the redevelopment of our aged buildings in the private market," she told reporters after attending a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it is activities between the private owners of individual flats and those developers who are interested in acquiring their flats. So there is no question of the government going into this market and having flats built to rehouse those owners affected.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the government will assist minority owners in several ways, including establishing dedicated support centres that offer legal and valuation advice, as well as asking the Urban Renewal Authority to gather owners who would like their flats redeveloped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the development minister said that developers could be given the responsibility for land formation if they win tenders for sites in the huge Northern Metropolis development. She said the winning consortiums would also need to help build infrastructure and community facilities in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This approach will help reduce the cash flow burden on the government because we do not have to use public funding to do the site formation and other infrastructure on our own,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the fact that the government recorded revenue of less than HK$200 million from land sales in the first quarter, against a target for the full year of HK$33 billion. She said the situation may change as the year progresses, so there was no need yet to rethink the target.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations' highest court said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," President Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a swift reaction, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as "fundamentally wrong" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICJ opinion also found that the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the opinion "historic" and urged states to adhere to it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation," Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday, as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among the star names to miss the cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Only 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc, with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here," said Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also well in the running at one under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy's decade-long wait for a major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That four-hole stretch to start off is what cost me," said the Northern Irishman. "Twenty-two holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Express announced on Saturday that it was cancelling 20 flights as it continues to grapple with the effects of Friday's massive global technical outage, though four flights previously announced as cancelled have been reinstated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The low-cost carrier said its booking and online check-in systems had "largely resumed" after
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "HK Express confirms that the service system of our service provider Navitaire, which was previously impacted by the global Microsoft system outage, is gradually resumed," the airline said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are doing our best to ensure that all systems resume normal operation as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four flights that were reinstated, flights 172, 173, 552 and 553, will be moved to different take-off slots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is urging passengers whose flights have been cancelled not to go to the airport, but to make sure their contact information on the "Manage My Booking" app is up to date and to check their email regularly for the latest flight arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We appreciate our customers' patience and understanding," the airline said. "For other unaffected flights, passengers are advised to arrive at the airport as usual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Airport Authority said on Saturday that its operations had returned to normal. Contingency measures, including manual check-ins for some flights, had been in place on Friday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell decisively for a second straight session on Friday following a major IT outage that roiled many businesses at a time when analysts consider the market "overbought."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines, banks, TV stations and financial institutions were among those thrown into turmoil due to a faulty update to an antivirus programme for Windows systems from American cybersecurity group CrowdStrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outage added more uncertainty at a time when markets were already edgy over speculation that President Joe Biden will withdraw from the 2024 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 40,287.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.7 percent to 5,505, while the Nasdaq declined 0.8 percent to 17,726.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The market was extremely overbought so it was just a matter of time before we had a pullback," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far it has been relatively mild and I think earnings are going to be an important factor as to whether" the market keeps falling, Cahill said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Netflix fell 1.5 percent despite adding eight million new subscribers in the second quarter. But some analysts said the company's third-quarter revenue forecast was disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other companies reporting results, Travelers sank 7.7 percent, while American Express fell 2.7 percent and Schlumberger advanced 2.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company at the heart of the global outage, tumbled 11.1 percent. CEO George Kurtz announced that a fix had been rolled out for the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starbucks jumped 6.9 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that activist investor Elliott Investment Management had taken a stake in the coffee company. (AFP)

    Japan gymnast Miyata pulled from Olympics for smoking

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Teenage gymnast Shoko Miyata has been pulled from Japan's team for the Paris Olympics after being caught smoking and drinking, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old, a world bronze medallist and captain of Japan's women's gymnastics team for the Games, was sent home from their training camp in Monaco after admitting she had violated their code of conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With her confirmation and after discussions on all sides, it has been decided that she will withdraw from the Olympics," Japan Gymnastics Association (JGA) secretary general Kenji Nishimura told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said the association had been told that Miyata was seen smoking in a private setting in Tokyo some time at the end of June or beginning of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also reportedly drank alcohol in a room at Japan's national training centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoking and drinking are both illegal under the age of 20 in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said it was not clear whether Miyata was at a party or drinking alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being a member of the Japan national gymnastics team is a position where you have high demands on you all the time," said JGA chairman Tadashi Fujita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fujita said that Miyata was already back in Japan after leaving the team's camp and that the JGA would give her support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miyata won bronze in the balance beam at the 2022 world championships in Liverpool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the all-around title at Japan's national championships earlier this year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday he would meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi next week at an Asean ministerial meeting in Laos.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I speak to him on a fairly regular basis, and I'll be seeing him next week, in fact, in Laos," Blinken said during a security forum in the US state of Colorado, welcoming the dialogue with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not specify whether the two would hold a separate bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) foreign ministers meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite disagreements in several key areas, relations between the United States and China have stabilised since a summit between US President Joe Biden and his President Xi Jinping in November 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reestablished regular, high-level engagements between our countries, which is vitally important, because if you want to avoid any kind of unintended conflict, you have to start talking, you have to start communicating," said Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his second visit to China in less than a year, Blinken met in April with Xi, who called on the two countries to be "partners, not rivals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the top US diplomat spoke of a "steady pace" of meetings, including between the two countries' militaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important because we're able to communicate very clearly where we disagree. So China at least knows where we're coming from, just like we know where they're coming from," he said. (AFP)

    Pogacar closes on Tour triumph with stage 19 win

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tadej Pogacar overcame previous issues with altitude to claim stage 19. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762375_1_20240720013404.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tadej Pogacar climbed to a convincing victory on stage 19 of the Tour de France on Friday, extending his overall lead over defending champion Jonas Vingegaard to close on a historic Tour-Giro double.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With two tough stages remaining, the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France champion Pogacar leads Vingegaard by 5min 3sec while Remco Evenepoel remains third, now at 7min 1sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar is also two stages away from a Giro d'Italia and Tour de France double, which would be a first since 1998.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A dominant and confident Pogacar promised to attack here on the 'Queen' stage with its massive mountains and came into stage 19 with a 3min 11sec lead over Vingegaard, with Evenepoel at 5min 11sec in third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous weak moments for the Team UAE rider have come at altitude and in hot weather, as he let slip the last two Tour de France titles to the Dane Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So the 25-year-old will have been happy riding under overcast skies as the mercury dipped to 18.5 Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was plenty of altitude on the menu however as the pack first crossed the fan-packed Col de la Bonette, a 23km climb at 7 percent average gradient to the dizzying altitude of 2,800m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final climb to Isola 2000 ski resort is hardly less crushing and Pogacar attacked with a jaw-dropping 10km to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left his rivals trailing in his wake and chewed up the attackers one by one in quick succession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matteo Jorgenson was second on the day at 21sec, while Simon Yates had led much of the way but dropped to third at 40sec after Pogacar passed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Carapaz was fourth at 1min 11sec and Evenepoel fifth with Vingegaard on his wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eritrean break-out star Biniam Girmay retained the green sprint jersey ahead of Jasper Philipsen as the escape group took the intermediate sprint points way ahead of the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay and Philipsen have both won three stages on this year's race, while Pogacar has four. (AFP)

    Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong dies aged 80

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In power since 2011, Trong had enjoyed remarkable longevity in office. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762370_1_20240719235331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong died on Friday aged 80 "after a period of illness," the ruling Communist Party said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came a day after the party that Trong led said he would hand over power to focus on receiving medical treatment for an undisclosed medical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, state media announced Trong had passed away in the afternoon at a military hospital "due to old age and serious illness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be a special statement on the organisation of the funeral at the national level," state media added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's responsibilities have been handed to the country's largely ceremonial president, To Lam, a powerful former public security minister long seen as jockeying for the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Politburo calls on the entire party, people and army to have absolute trust in the party's leadership and state management," it said on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's communist regime, which is in the midst of a complete overhaul, has undergone a series of upheavals in recent months, with ministers, business leaders and two presidents all falling from grace as part of a vast anti-corruption campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was voted in as president in May by Vietnam's rubber-stamp parliament after his predecessor was forced to resign as part of the anti-graft drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said at the time that Lam, who was deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption matters, had weaponised investigations to take down his political rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Headed by the party general secretary, Vietnam's leadership structure gives the president the second-most authority, and also includes the prime minister and the head of the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's poor health had fuelled widespread speculation that he would not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress, which is expected to appoint a successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In power since 2011, Trong enjoyed remarkable longevity in office, during a mandate that rights groups say has coincided with increasing authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known for being a technocrat and on good terms with Beijing, he structured the party around himself, benefiting from a decade of economic growth that strengthened his legitimacy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US reporter Evan Gershkovich was sentenced by a Russian court on Friday to 16 years prison for "espionage", a verdict reached after just over three weeks of secretive court proceedings denounced by Washington as a sham.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia has a policy of not exchanging prisoners internationally unless they have already been convicted, potentially paving the way for the 32-year-old to be swapped in a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was sentenced to "punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of 16 years in a strict regime colony," Judge Andrei Mineyev said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich did not appear to react to the sentencing, standing in a glass defendants' cage in dark trousers and a T-shirt. He waved to his journalist colleagues as he was led away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wall Street Journal correspondent, who pleaded not guilty, became the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Cold War when he was detained in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the United States government and his employer believe are fabricated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist," the Journal's publisher Almar Latour and editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Press rights group Reporters Without Borders slammed the sentencing as "outrageous" and called for Gershkovich to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington believes he is being held as a bargaining chip to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His trial has moved rapidly since the first hearing in late June, with the prosecution and defence teams giving their final arguments on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other similar cases in Russia have dragged on far more slowly, with several weeks or even months between hearings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked on Friday, the Kremlin refused to be drawn into speculation about the prospect of a prisoner swap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin has provided no public evidence for the spying allegations against Gershkovich, saying only that he was caught "red-handed" spying on a tank factory in the Urals region and was working for the CIA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said on Friday that Gershkovich acted with "careful measures of secrecy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions are running extremely high between the countries over Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow and Washington have both said they are open to exchanging the reporter in a deal, but neither has given clues on when that might happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that talks between US and Russian special services over possible prisoner exchanges were ongoing, without naming any specific individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has implied he wants to see the release of Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted in Germany of killing a Chechen separatist commander. German judges said it was an assassination orchestrated by Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other US nationals detained in Russia are reporter Alsu Kurmasheva and ballerina Ksenia Karelina, who are both dual US-Russian citizens, and former US marine Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for spying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US-born son of Soviet emigres raised in New Jersey, Gershkovich had reported from Russia since 2017, still returning for reporting trips following Russia's Ukraine offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Moscow's isolated Lefortovo prison, he communicated with friends and family in hand-written letters that revealed he had not lost hope about his situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At his first trial hearing on June 26, he spoke briefly to greet journalists and appeared smiling and cheerful, while revealing that his head had been fully shaved, as it was on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A United Nations working group this month stated that Gershkovich's detention on spying charges was "arbitrary" and called for his immediate release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Evan has never been employed by the United States government. Evan is not a spy," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has warned US citizens still in Russia to "depart immediately" due to the risk of wrongful arrest. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it is highly concerned about a large-scale IT outage involving Microsoft systems, saying officials will keep a close watch on developments and prepare to react accordingly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the Deputy Chief Secretary will be responsible for monitoring the situation, adding that the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has been in touch with Microsoft, urging it to assist affected companies, and come up with remedial measures as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said government systems are running normally for the time being, and that the Airport Authority has triggered an emergency response mechanism to minimise disruptions to passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Productivity Council’s Computer Emergency Response Team (HKCERT), meanwhile, called on people to back up their important data to prevent information loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It advised organisations to enable offline access for applications and documents as well to minimise interruptions to everyday operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The response team also reminded firms to come up with contingency plans in case similar incidents happen again.

    HK airport hit by global IT outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) on Friday said contingency measures are in place after a number of airlines were affected by a global outage involving Microsoft systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the disruption affected five airlines, including Hong Kong Express, adding that these carriers had to switch to manual check-in, which was more time consuming and resulted in the delay of around a dozen flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dicky, a tourist from Thailand, said he had arrived at the airport hours before his flight but couldn't check into his HK Express flight to Bangkok
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I am not in a hurry today, so I still can wait, but I am not sure for some people... If someone is in a hurry, then there definitely will be a delay. I mean, if I cannot check in now, it means maybe the flight will be delayed because they just say, please wait a moment, and then when the time has come, they will call us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another traveller, surnamed Li, said his flight to the Thai capital was postponed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our travel plans will be slightly affected, for example the hotel arrangements, transportation and other issues. They might affect our itinerary. My kid may fall asleep very late tonight after arriving there. In such situations, we can only wait. There are no alternatives apart from waiting. I hope that the system will recover soon," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA said it has deployed additional staff to assist affected passengers, and that it is in close communication with airline operators to address the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said its computer system has been functioning normally despite the global outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said it will ensure that the operations of public hospitals will continue as normal, and that it will closely monitor the situation.

    Airports, broadcasters worldwide hit by tech outage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A checkout terminal at a Cole stores in the Australian capital of Canberra is hit by IT issues. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762322_1_20240719173253.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A global tech outage was disrupting operations in multiple industries on Friday, with airlines halting flights, some broadcasters off-air and everything from banking to healthcare hit by system problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United Airlines and Allegiant Air grounded flights citing communication problems. The order came shortly after Microsoft said it resolved its cloud services outage that impacted several low-cost carriers, though it was not immediately clear whether those were related.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A third party software outage is impacting computer systems worldwide, including at United. While we work to restore those systems, we are holding all aircraft at their departure airports," United said in a statement. "Flights already airborne are continuing to their destinations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's government said outages suffered by media, banks and telecoms companies there appeared to be linked to an issue at global cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to an alert sent by Crowdstrike to its clients, the company’s “Falcon Sensor” software is causing Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the “Blue Screen of Death”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alert, which was sent at 05.30GMT on Friday, also shared a manual workaround to rectify the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Crowdstrike spokesperson did not respond to emails or calls requesting comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no information to suggest the outage was a cyber security incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outages rippled far and wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The travel industry was among the hardest hit with airports around the world, including Tokyo, Amsterdam, Berlin and several Spanish airports reporting problems with their systems and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International airlines, including Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned of problems with their booking systems and other disruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Britain, booking systems used by doctors were offline, multiple reports from medical officials on X said, while Sky News, one of the country's major news broadcasters was off air, apologising for being unable to transmit live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks and other financial institutions from Australia to India and South Africa warned clients about disruptions to their services, while LSEG Group reported an outage of its data and news platform Workspace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon's AWS cloud service provider said in a statement that it was "investigating reports of connectivity issues to Windows EC2 instances and Workspaces within AWS."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear whether all reported outages were linked to Crowdstrike problems or there were other issues at play. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has partnered with its third tech company, Galbot, to further develop the city's AI sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company makes a humanoid robot, also named Galbot, which can complete basic household chores, such as hanging clothes, opening and closing drawers and pouring drinks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Wang, director of the PKU-Galbot Lab of Embodied AI, explained what the partnership with HKIC means for the development of AI in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Leveraging Hong Kong’s strong market resources, abundant talent pool, and broad international insights, we look forward to curating attention and building credibility in domestic and international markets. Concurrently, we will bring Hong Kong the most cutting-edge embodied AI technology and cultivate top-tier talent with multi-disciplinary capabilities,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The partnership is also aimed at opening up more avenues for discussion surrounding AI for the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 30 secondary school students were invited to a launch ceremony on Friday, to engage in dialogue with forum guests and interact with Galbot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We look forward to doing more with Galbot in terms of cultivating our young talent,” said Clara Chan, CEO of HKIC.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A baleen whale found dead off Sai Kung last year was killed by back and spine injuries that were likely caused by propellers of a “fast-moving vessel”, authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said they could not determine what type of vessel had hit the mammal, but ruled out the possibility it was a whale-watching or fishing boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sightings of the juvenile Bryde’s whale had led to people going out in boats to try to get a glimpse of it, and officials urged against any chases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An expert from Spain consulted on the matter narrowed down the time of the whale's death to between the evening of July 30 and the early hours of the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A necropsy also found two fresher wounds on the whale, including one near its blowhole and the other near the dorsal fin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can be concluded that the cause of death of this Bryde’s whale was a fatal boat strike,” the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The individual may have become separated from its mother or lost her, depriving it of maternal care and guidance. As a result, it was exposed to an unfavourable environment and local dangers.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Leung, who chairs an expert group on the conservation of marine mammals, said the boat involved was likely a dual propeller vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said no whale-watching activity was detected during the four days prior to the mammal’s death, and that fishing vessels generally do not travel at such high speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We cannot tell what kind of vessel it was, and also we cannot tell the size of the vessel,” said AFCD director Mickey Lai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But the only thing we know…the vessel striking the whale should be travelling at a very high speed. We are talking about over 10 knots or even faster. But for the exact speed, we can’t tell.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten knots is roughly equivalent to 18.5 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said officials will look into amending laws to designate temporary restriction areas more quickly, and banning whale-watching activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If the legislation can give us more power in imposing more control within the restriction area, and give us more flexibility, and also give us more power to designate this area in a shorter period of time, it can really help us to protect the whale within a really short period of time,” Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are talking about emergency situations, and everything has to be done within a very short period of time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration aims to put forward concrete proposals to the expert group in the third quarter of this year the earliest.

    New penalties facing public housing tenants

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Housing Authority could kick out any household that picks up 16 penalty points within a two-year period. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762295_1_20240719155226.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority (HA) on Friday announced new rules that punish public housing tenants for feeding feral pigeons or hanging objects from their windows.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HA, tenants will receive seven penalty points for "feeding feral pigeons or other wild animals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tenants will also be slapped with seven penalty points for "hanging or placing objects with potential risk of falling from height outside the window, balcony or façade".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, residents are restricted from placing objects in corridors or staircases only.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, tenants will receive 15 penalty points if they resist or obstruct the HA or its authorised personnel in carrying out their duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any household that accumulates 16 points within a two-year period faces eviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new measures will take effect in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enhanced measures aim to provide a clean, hygienic and safe living environment for public rental housing (PRH) residents and strengthen the effectiveness of enforcement," an HA spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the HA will step up promotion before the new regulations come into force.

 The Hong Kong Cruise & Yacht Industry Association announced on Friday that it has relocated to Singapore, saying it's following the lead of international cruise ships.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association said it made the move this month after taking into account operating costs and that a lot of international operators have switched their focus to the city state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's chief executive, Kara Yeung, said other cities did more than Hong Kong to support the sector's recovery after the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong was relatively lacking behind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only a few cruises came to the region this summer, and none of them call the SAR as their home port."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said Hong Kong has been promoting the recovery of the cruise industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said cruise ship arrivals this year have returned to pre-Covid levels, and it is working hard to increase the number of ship calls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The New People's Party on Friday called for a reduction in rents for retailers operating from government premises, to help them cope with a citywide slump in sales.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said it recently sent questionnaires to more than 400 stores across the city, with shopkeepers reporting a drop in customer numbers and an increase in store vacancies, particularly in Northern District and Tai Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five percent of the shops said their rent had gone up after the pandemic, while almost 60 percent said they had seen a fall in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent official figures showed retail spending in May was down 11 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party noted that many people are heading to Shenzhen at the weekend to make cheaper purchases, urging the government to help alleviate the pressure on local retailers with rent cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also suggested the government should come up with area-specific promotions to help all 18 districts in the city attract visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't believe that [Hong Kong] has lost the market competition. We can have different promotion techniques for the government to promote together with the districts other than doing the same thing in all 18 districts," said the party's vice-chairwoman Eunice Yung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that rather than focusing on special days, tourism promotions should be expanded to ensure a constant stream of visitors.

    Trump takes centre stage in Republican convention

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump, centre, along with members of his family and his running mate, JD Vance, second right, greet party faithful on the final day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump, sombre and bandaged, accepted the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday at the Republican National Convention in a speech that described in detail the assassination attempt that could have ended his life just five days earlier before laying out a sweeping populist agenda, particularly on immigration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 78-year-old former US president, known best for his bombast and aggressive rhetoric, began his acceptance speech with a softer and deeply personal message that drew directly from his brush with death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moment by moment, the crowd listening in silence, Trump described standing onstage in Butler, Pennsylvania, with his head turned to look at a chart on display when he felt something hit his ear. He raised his hand to his head and saw immediately that it was covered in blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin’s bullet would have perfectly hit its mark,” Trump said. “And I would not be here tonight. We would not be together.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump’s address, the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes, marked the climax and conclusion of a massive four-day Republican pep rally that drew thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to swing-state Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing political opportunity in the wake of his near-death experience, the often bombastic Republican leader embraced a new tone he hopes will help generate even more momentum in an election that appears to be shifting in his favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart,” Trump said, wearing a large white bandage on his right ear, as he has all week, to cover a wound he sustained in the Saturday shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While he spoke in a gentler tone than at his usual rallies, Trump also outlined an agenda led by what he promises would be the largest deportation operation in US history. He repeatedly accused people crossing the US-Mexico border illegally of staging an “invasion.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, he teased new tariffs on trade and an “America first” foreign policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also falsely suggested Democrats had cheated during the 2020 election he lost, despite a raft of federal and state investigations proving there was no systemic fraud, and suggested “we must not criminalise dissent or demonise political disagreement” even as he has long called for prosecutions of his opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not mention abortion rights, an issue that has bedeviled Republicans ever since the US Supreme Court struck down a federally guaranteed right to abortion two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump nominated three of the six justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump at his rallies often takes credit for Roe being overturned and argues states should have the right to institute their own abortion laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nor did he mention the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in which Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has long referred to the people jailed for the riot as “hostages.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indeed, Trump barely mentioned Biden, often referring only to the “current administration.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was Donald Trump who destroyed our economy, ripped away rights, and failed middle class families,” said Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, in a statement after the speech. “Now he pursues the presidency with an even more extreme vision for where he wants to take this country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention ends at an uncertain moment in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With less than four months to go in the contest, major changes in the race are possible, if not likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's appearance came as Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, clings to his party’s presumptive nomination in the face of unrelenting pressure from key congressional allies, donors and even former President Barack Obama, who fear he may be unable to win reelection after his disastrous debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long pressed by allies to campaign more vigorously, Biden is instead in isolation at his beach home in Delaware after having been diagnosed with Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention has showcased a Republican Party reshaped by Trump since he shocked the GOP establishment and won over the party’s grassroots on his way to the party’s 2016 nomination. Rivals Trump has vanquished – including senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis – put aside their past criticisms and gave him their unqualified support.

    'Higher people's confidence to boost domestic demand'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Einar Tanger says consumers should have confidence in the Chinese economy. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762259_2_20240719133037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing-based commentator said China is trying to boost people's confidence to help shore up domestic demand and overall economic growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The end of the Communist Party's third plenum on Thursday saw the adoption of a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively, with the goal of building a high-standard socialist market economy by 2035.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Latest government figures showed growth in the world's second-largest economy slowed to 4.7 percent in the second quarter, down from 5.3 percent in the January-March period. Retail sales also reported slower growth, from 3.7 percent in May to 2 percent in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of domestic demand, they're trying to instil confidence. They want people to believe in what the party is doing, the fact that China is 30 percent of the world's growth, that it continues to be the centre of manufacturing," Einar Tanger, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chinese consumers should realise that, that China is in a better position to weather the current storms and uncertainties that are being caused internationally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tanger said another key challenge for the authorities is to stabilise the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The real estate sector is a product of very large companies taking huge leverage. They were borrowing massive amounts of money on the expectation that they'd make lots of profits. Unfortunately, the demand did not justify supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government does not want to see a spiral of inflationary rises in housing prices because they're already too high. So what they're trying to do is to keep them steady. So you can expect them to continue to say, 'Look, if you've bought a house, we'll make sure that it gets finished,' but they're not going to put money into the pockets of these very wealthy developers who have not been very good businessmen."
