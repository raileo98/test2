<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)

    'Certain mosquito repellents fail to keep bugs away'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday said many mosquito repellents may not deliver on their marketing, with one brand it checked seemingly attracting the insects instead of keeping them away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Checks on Cherub Rubs Scatterbugs found that more mosquitos landed on the tester's forearm than before it was applied.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Of the 25 repellent brands examined, only one sample, containing Deet, passed the test perfectly, with no mosquitoes landing on the tester's arm.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some natural or herbal brands repelled certain types of mosquito, but not those that spread dengue fever.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, said consumers should choose the products carefully.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Mosquito repellent products with chemical or natural ingredients each have their own advantages and drawbacks. Consumers may consult physicians and pharmacists and choose suitable products according to usage and health conditions," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan also urged the makers of mosquito repellents to list out the ingredients in the label clearly and state whether the product is suitable for children.

    Spam call blocker apps pose privacy risk: watchdog
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday warned that the personal data of people who use apps to block spam callers could be at risk because some of these apps pass on the information to third parties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The watchdog investigated five such apps and found that two of them uploaded details from the user’s list of contacts onto their databases.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The council found that third parties could then access sensitive details including addresses and the monthly rents the contacts paid.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It's suspected these were extracted from the contact lists of landlords or property agents who also used the apps.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The council found that one of the apps would also access up to eight items of personal data, including names, photos and dates of birth, when registered via Facebook.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, reminded users to stay vigilant when using these apps.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Consumers should pay attention to the following when using blocker apps. Read the terms of service and privacy policy before use, and evaluate whether the blocker app is trustworthy and the permission is reasonably commensurate with the functions offered," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite the privacy risk, Chan also called on users to proactively report spam to help apps identify and block the latest telemarketing and spam calls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.

    Encampment on California campus cleared

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753383_1_20240516135013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday took back a lecture hall from pro-Palestinian protesters who for hours occupied the building at the University of California, Irvine, then cleared a student encampment that stood for more than two weeks, witnesses said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers from about 10 nearby law-enforcement agencies converged on the campus after university officials requested help because protesters had occupied the lecture hall, leading the school to declare it a "violent protest," police and university officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About four hours later, police had ejected the protesters from both the lecture hall and the plaza that had been the site of the encampment, according to the university and Reuters witnesses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The police have retaken the lecture hall," UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich said by telephone from the scene. "The plaza has been cleared by law-enforcement officers."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vasich said there were a "minimal number of arrests" and characterised the protesters as "begrudgingly cooperative."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The university said all classes would be held remotely on Thursday, asking employees not to come to campus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The demonstration at Irvine, about 65km south of Los Angeles, is the latest in a series of campus protests across the United States over the war in Gaza in which activists have called for a ceasefire and the protection of civilian lives while demanding universities divest from Israeli interests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UC Irvine protesters had established an encampment adjacent to the lecture hall on April 29 similar to those at other universities that have led to mass arrests and clashes with police elsewhere in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Wednesday, 200 to 300 protesters took over the lecture hall at a time when no classes were in session, Vasich said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police responded in riot gear and formed a barricade while an officer on a loudspeaker warned the crowd that they had formed an unlawful assembly and risked arrest if they remained, the Orange County Register reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Students chanted slogans, banged drums and hoisted banners, with rows of police standing nearby, Reuters witnessed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One banner hung from the building declared the site "Alex Odeh Hall," in honor of a Palestinian activist who was killed in a 1985 office bombing in the nearby city of Santa Ana.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Four adjacent research buildings with potentially hundreds of people inside were locked down, and those inside were instructed to shelter in place, Vasich said, though the university later altered that instruction and instead advised them to leave.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shortly before nightfall, police moved in on the lecture hall, then engaged in a tense standoff with protesters at the encampment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Helmeted police wielding batons formed a line against protesters. Police gradually moved forward, pushing the students back every few minutes, until the officers rushed the crowd and made more arrests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Before long most demonstrators had retreated, police held the otherwise empty plaza strewn with trash, and a few onlookers remained at the periphery. (Reuters)

    Survey suggests civil servant pay rises of up to 5.47%
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of a survey on pay trends have suggested rises of up to 5.47 percent for civil servants this year, while warning that it would be "premature" for people to presume the administration will adopt their figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The survey, based on data gathered from more than 110 private firms, points to rises of 4.01 percent for senior civil servants, 4.32 percent for middle-ranking workers and 5.47 percent for junior staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The numbers are not themselves recommendations in any way for an increase, decrease or anything. They are factors to be considered among a number of other factors," said Laurence Li, who chairs the Pay Trend Survey Committee.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's premature to try to forecast how these things will all be put into the pot."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government says other factors to consider when looking at pay rises for civil servants are the state of the economy, changes in the cost of living, the administration's fiscal position, pay claims from staff and civil service morale.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service Clement Leung was asked whether different weight will be put on the various factors when making a decision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Each year, in a way, is a separate exercise, because the economic situation, the situation of the government's fiscal position are different. Every time we will have to have two-way communications with our staff side's representatives," Leung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “That will be something that we will have to work on in the next few weeks, and particularly, listening to the views of our staff associations on their sentiments and their views on civil service morale, as well as their proposals."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, senior civil servants received pay rises of 2.87 percent, while those in middle and junior ranks got 4.65 percent. This was roughly in line with the results of that year's pay trend survey.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department on Thursday announced new ID card replacement arrangements as it prepares to move its headquarters from Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in the middle of next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From June 11, the new headquarters will start providing services, and the Registration of Persons office in Kwun Tong will also be relocated to Tseung Kwan O.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The main services provided by the Registration of Persons Office in Tseung Kwan O include applications for first registration of ID cards, replacement of ID cards due to due to defacement or loss, and amendment of registered particulars on ID cards," said assistant principal immigration officer Wong Ka-yee.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wong added that the Tseung Kwan O office will also handle the replacement of new smart ID cards during extended service hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 People who have applied for an ID card change on or before June 8 can collect their cards at a temporary office in Kwun Tong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, the Registration of Persons Office at Immigration Tower in Wan Chai will continue to provide ID card replacement services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 31 points in a triple-double, and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 104-92 to take a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference semifinal series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Doncic, the league's leading scorer in the regular season, had struggled some in the series against Oklahoma City.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Playing through a sprained right knee and a sore left ankle, he had averaged just 22 points on 39% shooting through the first four games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But in Game 5, he made 12 of 22 field goals and had 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his sixth career playoff triple-double.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Derrick Jones Jr. scored a playoff career-high 19 points and P.J. Washington Jr. added 10 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which shot 52.6% from the floor. The No. 5-seeded Mavericks can advance to the Western Conference finals with a win at home on Sunday morning Hong Kong time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 30 points for the top-seeded Thunder, but no other Oklahoma City player scored more than 13 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Mavericks won Game 5 on the road, just like they did in the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers. Dallas held Oklahoma City to 42.5% shooting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Oklahoma City tried to jump-start its struggling offense by replacing Josh Giddey with Isaiah Joe in the starting lineup. Giddey did not start for the first time in 229 combined regular season and postseason games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Dallas led by 15 in the second quarter and took a 54-44 edge into halftime. Jones scored 15 points before the break.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gilgeous-Alexander scored 14 points in the third quarter, but Dallas still led 79-67.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Thunder never got closer than seven points in the final period. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 2,500 policymakers, academics and medical professionals on Thursday gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for a two-day summit on health innovation and investment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The "Asia Summit on Global Health", jointly organised by the government and the Trade Development Council, features a series of thematic sessions on the latest trends in different medical sectors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the importance of public health.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Health is wealth. Health is an ever-revolving discipline that affects all of humanity. It affects the lives of every individual in any economy of the world, big or small, rich or poor, liberal or conservative. Public health is the foundation of society and the very basis of humankind to thrive," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also told the summit that the SAR thrives as an international metropolis that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the mainland and the rest of the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cao Xuetao, the vice-minister of the National Health Commission, told the same event that Hong Kong has been using its geopolitical advantages to promote healthcare development.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As an international centre for finance, shipping, trade, innovation and technology, Hong Kong has actively leveraged its advantage of having the strong support of the country and being closely connected to the world to innovate in medicine and health," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The mainland official added that it is crucial to work together and explore new opportunities in the field of medicine and health given complex changes in the international situation.

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping told Russian President Vladimir Putin that China-Russia relations today have not come easily and should be cherished and cared for by both sides, state media said on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi made the remarks when the two leaders met in Beijing, where he said China will be a good neighbour to Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "On this new journey, China will always be a good neighbour, friend and partner of mutual trust with Russia, and further consolidate the friendship of the people of the two countries," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China is ready to work together with Russia to achieve development and rejuvenation of our countries and uphold world equality and justice."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin is in China for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane in Beijing in the small hours of Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Later in the morning, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Putin at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During their meeting, Putin said: "Russia-China cooperation is not directed against any other power and is a stabilising factor for the world."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election, and the second in just over six months to China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Before his visit, Putin, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, had praised Xi for helping to build a strategic partnership between Beijing and Moscow based on national interests and deep mutual trust.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Ukraine, Putin said: “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means."
 <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jayson Tatum led Boston to their third straight Eastern Conference finals, a feat the team last accomplished in the 1980s when they did it for five consecutive years.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 25 points as the Boston Celtics overpowered the injury-hit Cleveland Cavaliers 113-98 to book their place in the Eastern Conference finals for the third straight year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The top-seeded Celtics won the series 4-1, yet they were pushed all the way by a battling Cleveland team.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cavs' hopes of clawing their way back into the best-of-seven series were rocked before the game as three of their top six players -- Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert -- were confirmed to be out with injury.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Cleveland shrugged off that setback to produce a battling performance that saw them get within three points of the Celtics midway through the fourth quarter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Evan Mobley was superb for Cleveland, pouring in a game-high 33 points while Marcus Morris Sr. added 25 off the bench.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yet just when Celtics fans at the TD Garden were nervously wondering if a shock defeat was on the cards, Boston stitched together a decisive 13-2 run -- crowned by a three-pointer from Tatum -- that left them ahead by 14 points at 101-87.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tatum, who also added 10 rebounds and nine assists, said Boston had prepared for a dogfight despite Cleveland's injury-stricken line-up.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Anybody who's played in this league understands what happens when somebody's best players are out," Tatum said. "The rest of the guys have more freedom. They play with a different level of confidence and they play different.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our mindset coming into this game was 'However long it takes, that's how long it takes'. We didn't expect to win the game in the first or second quarter. We grinded it out."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tatum said Boston were now determined to snap their dismal recent record in the Eastern Conference finals. Boston have lost in the Eastern Conference finals in four of five appearances since the 2016-2017 season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The superstar forward was one of six Boston players to finish in double figures. Al Horford shrugged off his recent struggles to post 22 points and 15 rebounds, while Derrick White scored 18.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Celtics will face either the New York Knicks or the Indiana Pacers for a place in the NBA Finals. (AFP)

    Canada wildfire doubles in size as thousands flee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Residents of Fort McMurray head away from their fire-threatened homes. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753344_1_20240516093213.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A wildfire in Canada's major oil-producing region doubled in size as it drew closer to the city of Fort McMurray on Wednesday, but officials were hopeful shifting winds could soon push it away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The blaze scorched almost 21,000 hectares of forest overnight as it came within 4.5 kilometres of the city, which was partly evacuated the day before.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alberta Wildfire spokeswoman Christie Tucker told a briefing that cooler temperatures and calmer winds were expected to "push the fire away from Fort McMurray" as well as weaken it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis urged residents to "remain vigilant," noting that "wildfire conditions can change and deteriorate rapidly."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For many, the fire has brought back terrifying memories of 2016 when a massive blaze gutted Fort McMurray, forcing its entire population of more than 90,000 to flee at a moment's notice.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm sure these memories will create fear and uncertainty for many in Fort McMurray and my sympathy is with everyone facing this situation, but safety must remain our top priority," said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, after 6,000 residents of four neighborhoods were ordered out on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many stores and schools were closed as a haze blanketed the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Freddy Saulnier, 51, who recently moved to Fort McMurray from New Brunswick on the Atlantic coast, says he is living "a nightmare."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Staying in a hotel room after being ordered to leave his home, he says he can smell the smoke. This fire "is a beast," he said. "It's almost like watching a horror movie, you don't know if the killer is hiding behind a tree, and it's eerily quiet at night."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After being pulled from the front lines the day before, firefighters were back on Wednesday along with water bombers dropping retardant, while heavy equipment operators built fire guards southwest of the town.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Canadian authorities have been bracing for another possibly devastating wildfire season, after the country's worst-ever last year saw flames burning from coast to coast and charring more than 15 million hectares of land. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United kept alive their hopes of salvaging a dismal season by qualifying for Europe as Amad Diallo's rocket inspired a 3-2 win against Newcastle on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Erik ten Hag's side are battling to secure a seventh place finish in the Premier League, which could secure a place in next season's UEFA Conference League.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United will qualify for the Europa League if they win the FA Cup final against Manchester City on May 25.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But if City triumph at Wembley then seventh will be enough for a Conference League spot.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And eighth-placed United are still in the hunt for that place after beating Newcastle to move level on points with the seventh-placed Magpies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Goals from Kobbie Mainoo, Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford gave United only their third win in nine league games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, United's goal difference is vastly inferior to Newcastle's, meaning they must better the Magpies' result in the last game of the season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United travel to Brighton on Sunday, while Newcastle head to Brentford.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Newcastle's defeat means fifth-placed Tottenham are guaranteed to be in the Europa League next season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sixth placed Chelsea won 2-1 at Brighton in Wednesday's other game to move closer to European qualification after a turbulent campaign.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead with the 22nd league goal of his superb season in the 34th minute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Christopher Nkunku doubled Chelsea's advantage in the 64th minute with his third league goal of an injury-plagued first season with the club.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mauricio Pochettino's side host Bournemouth on Sunday knowing a draw will be enough to earn a European berth, with fifth place still in play if they win and Tottenham lose at Sheffield United. (AFP)

    Zverev beats injury scare to reach Rome semis

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alexander Zverev celebrates his quarter final win. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753332_1_20240516080755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alexander Zverev reached his 18th Masters semi-final in Rome on Wednesday but only after a worrying fall which sparked memories of the horror injury he suffered at the French Open two years ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The world number five from Germany defeated Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 to set up a last-four duel with Alejandro Tabilo, the Chilean journeyman who had stunned Novak Djokovic earlier in the tournament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zverev's moment of concern came in just the third game on centre court at the Foro Italico when he fell on the clay and landed on his front.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 2017 champion cut his left wrist and a finger in the tumble and required treatment from the tournament physio before he continued the match.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zverev, 27, suffered a serious ankle injury at the 2022 French Open after falling on the clay of Roland Garros during his semi-final against Rafael Nadal and missed the rest of the season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Wednesday, however, he was able to dust himself down to defeat Fritz in 90 minutes, firing 20 winners with six aces and not facing a single break point.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chile's Tabilo will play his first-ever Masters 1000 semi-final at the age of 26, after seeing off unseeded Zhang Zhizhen of China 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 26 minutes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Women's second seed Aryna Sabalenka needed just an hour and 13 minutes to see off Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-4 on her way to the semis, improving her record against her Latvian opponent to three wins and no defeats.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sabalenka will next take on Miami Open winner Danielle Collins who eased past Victoria Azarenka 6-4, 6-3.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 26-year-old could get a rematch of the Madrid final which she lost in dramatic fashion to world number one Iga Swiatek earlier this month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rome is the first time since the 2013 French Open that the top three women have reached the last four of a WTA event of 250 level or higher, with Swiatek and world number three Coco Gauff in the other semi-final on Thursday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday after data showed a moderation in US consumer prices in April, boosting the chances for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All three major indices rocketed to fresh all-time highs after monthly US consumer prices came in slightly below expectations, with annual inflation at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage points from March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones gained 0.9 percent to 39,908, putting it back within striking distance of a first-ever close above 40,000 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 jumped 1.2 percent to 5,308, while the Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent to 16,742, notching a second straight record.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Retail sales were flat in April, missing estimates for a 0.4 percent increase.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The reports together "point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US stocks rallied in the first quarter on expectations for interest rate cuts, but hit obstacles later in the spring as Fed officials pushed back the timeframe for easing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Dell surged 11.2 percent after Morgan Stanley analysts lifted their price target on the technology company, highlighting its artificial intelligence offerings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Boeing slumped 2.1 percent after the Department of Justice said the company had breached a 2021 criminal settlement, potentially leading to criminal prosecution.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 GameStop and AMC Entertainment tumbled following two days of gains that prompted talk of a revived "meme stock" craze. GameStop dropped 18.9 percent, while AMC lost 20 percent. (AFP)

    English Premier League clubs to vote on scrapping VAR

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The EPL's controversial VAR system could be shown the red card in June. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753314_1_20240516022914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs will be given the chance to scrap VAR from next season when they vote on the controversial review system at their annual general meeting next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wolves have submitted a resolution to abolish VAR to the Premier League, triggering a vote of the top flight's 20 teams on June 6.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Molineux club said VAR is "undermining the value of the Premier League brand" after another season marred by a host of debatable decisions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In order for VAR to be axed by the Premier League, 14 of the 20 clubs will have to vote against it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wolves are expected to canvas other clubs in order to gain support before the meeting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 VAR was introduced in the Premier League in 2019 with the aim of helping referees avoid clear and obvious errors that had marred matches in the past.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But there have been numerous controversies surrounding the technology this season as Premier League managers and fans grow increasingly vocal in their disdain for the system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart," a Wolves statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wolves boss Gary O'Neil revealed he has regularly received apologetic phone calls from Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) chief Howard Webb after VAR decisions that went against his team.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The impact of VAR on goal celebrations, the length of time taken for checks and a lack of communication in the stadium are all issues that have irked supporters and cited by Wolves as reasons for scrapping the system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, the Premier League believes VAR is still a valuable tool.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The English top flight, which is in regular dialogue with referees' governing body PGMOL, believes the number of incorrect decisions would increase without VAR which could damage the competition's reputation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the Annual General Meeting next month," a Premier League spokesperson said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at Shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "However, the League fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL, to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The final of the Cheung Chau "Bun Scrambling" competition was held on Wednesday night at 12 midnight on the football pitch of the Pak Tai Temple Recreation Ground in Cheung Chau, rounding off a day of festivities attended by tens of thousands of people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Firefighter Yip Kin-man was crowned "Bun King" and nurse Kung Tsz-shan won the title of "Bun Queen."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nine male and three female finalists competed at the same time, clambering up a 14-metre-high mountain covered in 9,000 plastic buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They had to fill their own bags with buns totalling the most points within the time limit of 3 minutes, to win the coveted titles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kwok Ka-ming, a regular contestant and one of the favourites for the men's title, won the “Full Pocket of Lucky Buns” prize for snatching the most buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cheung Chau Bun Festival originated as a ritual for people to pray for safety from a plague.

    Biden, Trump to hold first presidential debate in June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CNN will host the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753306_1_20240516001511.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to hold a first presidential debate in June after the Democratic incumbent challenged his rival to "make my day" and the scandal-plagued Republican quickly responded he was ready to "rumble."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CNN announced it will hold the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Biden proposed a second debate for September and Trump accepted.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden, 81, had set out his own terms for the debates with political showman Trump, such as time limits for speakers and having no live audience – a condition CNN said it had agreed to.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In his first formal debate offer after months of stalling, the Democrat also shunned the traditional calendar proposed by the commission that has run debates since 1988 as he sought to exercise control over the format.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump, 77, accepted the dates even as he set out a starkly different vision with a larger venue for "excitement purposes" and accused the Democrat of being afraid of crowds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal," Biden said in a video on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'll even do it twice."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden also trolled Trump over his ongoing criminal hush money trial in New York, which features a mid-week break, adding: "So let's pick the dates Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CNN said in a statement that the debate would be held at its studios in Atlanta in the "crucial battleground state of Georgia."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "To ensure candidates may maximise the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present. Moderators for the debate and additional details will be announced at a later date," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden's debate offer appeared to show him taking the calculated risk of putting Trump back into American living rooms ahead of November's election, hoping it could reverse the Republican's poll lead in a series of battleground states.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden campaign has increasingly been trying to remind voters of what they say is the true face of the mercurial president who lost in 2020, amid what they fear is Trump "nostalgia" in some quarters – even as the Republican details his stark vision for an authoritarian second term in various interviews.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For his part, Trump has previously said he would debate his rival "anytime, anywhere" as he seeks to portray Biden as old and incapable of leadership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After Biden's challenge, Trump – who avoided any debates with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination this year – said he was "ready to Rumble!!!" for the proposed June and September debates. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753303_1_20240515231847.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia Prime Minister Robert Fico was on Wednesday shot multiple times and rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries after a cabinet meeting, officials said, in an attack condemned by EU chiefs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico, a populist leader accused of being Kremlin-friendly, has been prime minister since last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Today, after the government meeting in Handlova, there was an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Robert Fico," the government said in a post on social media.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He is currently being transported by helicopter to Banska Bystrica in a life-threatening condition, because it would take too long to get to Bratislava due to the necessity of an acute intervention," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico was shot multiple times, said a post on his official Facebook page.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We confirm the attack on the prime minister," police spokesman Matej Neumann said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Handlova local hospital director Marta Eckhardtova said "Fico was brought into our hospital and he was treated at our vascular surgery clinic."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was unable to describe his injuries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dennik N daily said its reporter heard several shots fired and then saw security guards lift the premier off the ground and into a car.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The newspaper also reported that police had detained the suspected gunman.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slovak President Zuzana Caputova said she was "utterly shocked by today's brutal and reckless attack on Slovakia's prime minister... which I condemn in (the) strongest possible terms."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I wish him a lot of strength in this critical moment and early recovery," she said on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also called the news of the attack "shocking."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I hope the prime minister will get well as soon as possible. We must not tolerate violence, it must have no place in society," he said on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: "Robert, my thoughts are with you in this very difficult moment."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As well as his current stint as premier, Fico also headed the government in 2006-10 and 2012-18.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since he was elected last October, Fico has made a string of remarks that have soured ties between Slovakia and neighbouring Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He has notably questioned Ukraine's sovereignty and called for a compromise with Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also sparked mass protests with controversial changes, including a media law that critics say will undermine the impartiality of public television and radio.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a press conference following the shooting, MP Lubos Blaha from Fico's Smer party lashed out against his critics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "You, the liberal media, and progressive politicians are to blame. Robert Fico is fighting for his life because of your hatred," Blaha said. (AFP)

    US consumer inflation eases slightly to 3.4 percent

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The CPI data helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates in a bid to bring inflation back down to its long-term target of two percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US consumer inflation eased slightly last month, according to US government data published on Wednesday, a positive sign for President Joe Biden ahead of November's election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The data supports the Biden administration's messaging that the US economy has turned a corner, as it looks to quell consumers' concerns about the impact of rising prices going into the likely rematch against former president Donald Trump.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage point from March, the US Labour Department said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monthly inflation came in at 0.3 percent, slightly below expectations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CPI data also helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates to their highest level for 23 years in a bid to bring inflation back down firmly to its long-term target of two percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It marks the first month of slowing annual data since January, although both the annual and monthly figures remain too high.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline," the Labour Department said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items," it added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A widely-watched inflation measure excluding volatile food and energy prices also eased last month, rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down from 3.8 percent in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The so-called "core" inflation index rose 0.3 percent in April from a month earlier, according to the Labour Department, also slightly lower than in March. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former SAR football internationals Lam Ka-wai and Lo Kwan-yee received the perfect send-offs before their retirement as they led Hong Kong Rangers to a 1-0 victory against Kitchee in the Sapling Cup final on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rangers still have a game to go in the Premier League season, but the veterans decided to make the cup final at Mong Kok Stadium their last game before hanging up their boots.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Midfielder Lam, a traditional number ten, captained underdogs Rangers, who took the lead late in the first half when striker Nassam Ibrahim scored a header from close range.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Defender Lo, 39, came on as a substitute in the second half to fortify Rangers’ defence, which stubbornly turned away the Kitchee advances for a magical victory.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After the game, Lam, 38, thanked both Rangers and Kitchee, a club he also spent more than a decade with, for giving him the opportunities as a player.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The playmaker said he was particularly grateful to his mother club Rangers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “After Covid, I was a jobless footballer for a period of time. They quickly called me and asked me to join the team,” Lam said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lo, for his part, said jokingly he’s upset that Lam didn’t thank him. But he wanted to thank his teammate anyway, saying they’ve gone through so much together in their careers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam was capped 51 times by Hong Kong, China, scoring nine goals. Lo also found the net nine times during the 53 games he represented the SAR.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Singapore will maintain their ties as both “complementors” and “competitors” as they navigate their way through an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, a veteran businessman with cross-market experience in both places said on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The remarks came as the Lion City ushered in a new era, with finance minister Lawrence Wong becoming the city-state’s first new prime minister in 20 years, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong who becomes senior minister of the cabinet.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think it's very positive,” said Dennis Chiu, chairman of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association (HSBA).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “He [Wong] really reflects the meritocracy system of Singapore, because he came from the very bottom of the ladder and then worked his way all up. He is very much a student of the Singapore system to show that.. in Singapore, anybody has a chance to reach the very top,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When asked how the new leadership might impact the business ties between the Lion City and the SAR, Chiu, who is also the executive director of Far East Consortium International and has straddled Hong Kong and Singapore for three decades, said he expects there will be “continuity” in terms of trade and business cooperation between the two places.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Singapore and Hong Kong have always played a complementary and competing role. And when you compete, you actually pick up good points from the other, so I think we are mutually learning from each other, but we also compete for the same dollar of investments,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I really don’t see there will be huge changes, but I think we will perhaps see how changes in the world will affect Hong Kong and Singapore,” he added, warning that geopolitics has become the most challenging factor affecting all economies, especially open economies like the two cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “You have to be neutral and to not choose a side,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The real estate veteran also said Hong Kong and Singapore could continue to cooperate in areas such as technology and digitisation, adoption of artificial intelligence, and green transition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Hong Kong, frankly speaking, has the huge market of China and the Greater Bay Area, [but] Singapore has Southeast Asia as its very important market. Those will always be the strengths of both of the cities’ finances,” Chiu added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think he [Wong] will be able to continue to carry on Lee's systems with him, we do not expect any new changes for the time being, but we want to see how he will be tested when new issues, such as Covid and international crises, come up,” he said. "This is something we all do not know."

    'Fare rise gives cabbies few thousand more a month'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 A taxi trade representative on Wednesday said cabbies are expected to earn thousands of dollars more every month when fares go up, but the sector is experiencing high operating costs and a change in passenger habits.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From July 14, there will be a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ng Kwan-shing of the Taxi Dealers & Owners Association said he believes the fare rises will mean cab drivers will earn around HK$100 extra for each shift, or an additional several thousand every month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he told an RTHK programme that both insurance and car maintenance cost more now, and that it's been challenging for nighttime taxi drivers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because passengers have changed their habits, there's been less business. I hope that after the fare hike, the government could help with the financial situation, allowing more individual visitors [to Hong Kong], so that we could get more business," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the same programme, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee ruled out the taxi trade's suggestion of a regular mechanism to review fare rates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade understands its own operating situation best... They may not submit [an application] every year, and it depends on changes to its operations and whether there is a need to ask for fare adjustments," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Every time we receive [an application], we will handle it cautiously and act as the gatekeeper. I think this approach has always been taken and is effective. So we don't have any plans to change it for the time being."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee added that how much cabbies earn is not the sole factor in deciding on fare adjustments.

 Indonesian rescuers raced on Wednesday to find dozens of people still unaccounted for after flash floods and cold lava flow that inundated neighbourhoods and swept away houses over the weekend left 67people dead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hours of torrential rain on Saturday caused mud and rocks to flow into districts near one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, sweeping away dozens of houses and damaging roads and mosques.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The national disaster agency chief Suharyanto on Wednesday said dozens remained missing, with the figure increasing periodically.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rescuers said many of the retrieved bodies were found in or around nearby rivers after locals were swept away by the deluge of volcanic material, mud and rain that tore through neighbourhoods.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Heavy equipment was deployed to clear debris from the areas worst hit by flooding, which has affected transport access in six districts, said Suharyanto, who goes by one name.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 3,300 people have been forced to evacuate from affected areas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To aid the rescue effort, authorities on Wednesday deployed weather modification technology, the term Indonesian officials use for cloud seeding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In this case, it is being used in a bid to make clouds rain earlier so the rainfall's intensity is weakened by the time it reaches the disaster-struck area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indonesia is prone to landslides and floods during the rainy season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2022, about 24,000 people were evacuated and two children were killed in floods on Sumatra island, with environmental campaigners blaming deforestation caused by logging for worsening the disaster.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trees act as a natural defence against floods, slowing the rate at which water runs down hills and into rivers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Children dressed up as Hong Kong celebrities, star athletes, deities and even government officials on Wednesday as thousands of people flocked to Cheung Chau for the island's annual bun festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Queues formed from the morning at shops offering buns stamped with peace messages, with sellers pleasantly surprised by the turnout.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We expected that there would be a drop of 10 to 20 percent in the visitor numbers when compared with last year. But the situation is better than our expectations," said one storekeeper surnamed Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think people want to experience the festive vibe, while hoping this can bring them peace and luck."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A man surnamed Wong told RTHK he was waiting patiently to get his hands on more than 10 buns in different flavours, for him and his family.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have waited for an hour. But I'm fine with queuing. It's not a big deal. It's just once a year. I've been coming to the festival for 12 years, since 2012," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I just hope everything goes smoothly and I wish for good health. The Cheung Chau residents believe that, so I just follow the local customs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the main highlights of the festival, the Piu Sik Parade, got underway in the afternoon, with children dressed up as various characters making their way through the island's streets on stilts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mini versions of star fencer Cheung Ka-long and swimmer Siobhan Haughey were in the Olympic spirit ahead of the upcoming Paris Games, while there were also sightings of Dragon Ball characters and Hong Kong singer and actor Aaron Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One child played security minister Chris Tang and another came as Executive Council convenor Regina Ip to explain Article 23 laws to the crowds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another child was decked out as an officer of the Environmental Protection Department, on duty to promote the city's planned waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alice, an exchange student in the SAR, hailed the atmosphere of the parade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's the drumming, all the little kids, everyone's smiling, happy. I like the lion dancers, the dragons. It's really nice, it's a really good day, lots of sun, so it's good fun. I'm staying around till the bun climbing," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indian tourist Azaira told RTHK the parade was "phenomenal".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's amazing, something I've never seen. But I think most importantly, it's the effort that everyone has taken to make this day so special," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I know it's Buddha's birthday and the costumes, the time, the effort that's taken to put into this. And of course the walking around in this heat.... I love it."

    'Social worker board vets applications individually'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board has stressed that the statutory body reviews every application on a case-by-case basis, after the government suggested the board might have erred in renewing and approving licences from people who had committed serious crimes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers, increasing the amount of appointed members and enabling "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Wednesday said there was an urgency to make legislative amendments, and that there were "very obvious cases" that had deviated from the spirit of the law in the eyes of the public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Let's say the board approved the renewal of someone who was involved in drug possession or trafficking. I am not saying this is wrong. But it was not reasonable to approve the application, when many people within the Social Workers Registration Board had strong opinions and huge concerns about it," Sun told an RTHK programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, argued on the same programme that people who had done something wrong in the past should be given a second chance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "From the day the board was formed till now, we still review every single application on a case-by-case basis. Even if someone has a criminal record, we will still consider [the application]," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some people had committed crimes when they were young. But after many years and undergoing social work training, they had reflected and changed... Even among recipients of 'Ten Outstanding Young Persons' were people who had committed crimes like drug possession or trafficking. Does it mean society should not give them the opportunity to change?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The proposed reforms will increase the number of board members from the current 15 to 27, with all required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seventeen members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tin Shui Wai secondary school says a teacher who failed to return as scheduled on Sunday from a study trip to the mainland came back to Hong Kong the following day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Education Bureau earlier said the teacher in question didn't make it back on May 11 after a four-day mainland study tour to Wuhan for new hires. It said it would require the teacher and the school to submit a report on what happened.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CUHKFAA Thomas Cheung Secondary School said late on Tuesday that the teacher returned to the SAR on the morning of May 12.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school has reported the incident to the incorporated management committee and established an investigation committee to follow up on the matter," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school is also maintaining close contact with the Education Bureau to learn about and handle the relevant incident. No further comments will be made at this stage."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Internet users had claimed that a secondary school teacher from Hong Kong had been arrested during a trip to Wuhan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday that it will comply with a court ruling and restrict viewing in Hong Kong of 32 banned links related to the song "Glory to Hong Kong", effective immediately.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action comes after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order last week banning the 2019 protest song.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the injunction helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A displaced Palestinian boy from Rafah arrives in Khan Yunis camp in Gaza. Nearly 450,000 people have been displaced from Rafah since May 6, according to the UN. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753223_1_20240515102851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden's administration informed Congress on Tuesday of a $1 billion weapons package for Israel, official sources told AFP, a week after threatening to withhold some arms over concerns of a Rafah assault.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The administration informally notified the weapons package to Congress, which will need to approve it, a US official said, while a congressional aide who also requested anonymity said the weapons bought from US weapons makers amounted to around $1 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The weapons would come out of a major $95 billion package recently approved by Congress in defense support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and the Biden administration has repeatedly said it planned to go ahead and appropriate the funds through purchases from US manufacturers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the deal comes a week after Biden warned he may withhold bombs and artillery shells to Israel if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went ahead in defiance of US warnings with an assault on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than one million Palestinians have taken shelter after half a year of war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden administration also confirmed last week that for the first time it had halted a shipment including 2,000-pound bombs, fearing they would be used with devastating risks for civilians in Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Congress could still block the weapons sale to Israel, with left-leaning members of Biden's Democratic Party outraged by the toll on civilians in the Gaza war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the overall package passed despite opposition from the left, with the rival Republican Party almost unanimously in support of arms for Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Wall Street Journal first reported the new arms package. It said it could potentially include $700 million in tank ammunition and $500 million in tactical vehicles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden administration, while increasingly critical of Israel, has made clear it will continue to support its ally's security and pointed to US assistance last month in shooting down Iranian drones launched in retaliation for a strike on a diplomatic facility.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental," Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told reporters on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs because we do not believe they should be dropped in densely populated cities. We are talking to the Israeli government about this," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the massive Israeli retaliation, the Biden administration has twice cited emergency needs to avoid the regular 30-day review by Congress of military transfers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Critics also point out that the Biden administration has sent a regular flow of weapons unknown to the public as they fall below the threshold for congressional notification. (AFP)

    Riots rock France's New Caledonia over voting reform

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French MPs attend a debate on the constitutional bill aimed at enlarging the electorate of the overseas French territory of New Caledonia, at the French National Assembly in Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753219_1_20240515095233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person was killed, hundreds more were injured, shops were looted and public buildings torched during a second night of rioting in New Caledonia, authorities said on Wednesday, as anger over constitutional reforms from Paris boiled over.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protests against the reform turned violent Monday night, with shots fired at security forces, vehicles torched and shops looted in the worst unrest the French overseas territory has seen since the 1980s.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response, authorities deployed a heavy security contingent, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and closed the main airport.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "More than 130 arrests have been made and several dozen rioters have been taken into custody and will be brought before the courts," the French High Commission of the Republic in New Caledonia said in a statement early Wednesday morning.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Describing the "serious public disturbances" as ongoing, the High Commission decried widespread looting and torching of businesses and public property, including schools.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that classes will remain scrapped until further notice and the main airport shut to commercial flights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The unrest flared as lawmakers in France debated a bill that would increase the number of people eligible to cast ballots in the territory's provincial elections, a change critics fear could marginalise Indigenous people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Following lengthy and at times tense debates, the National Assembly in Paris adopted the reform shortly after midnight, by 351 votes to 153.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Afterwards, French President Emmanuel Macron appealed for calm on all sides.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the Noumea Accord of 1998, France vowed to gradually give more political power to the Pacific island territory of nearly 300,000 people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Under the agreement, New Caledonia has held three referendums over its ties with France, all rejecting independence. But independence retains support, particularly among the Indigenous Kanak people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Noumea Accord has also meant that New Caledonia's voter lists have not been updated since 1998 -- meaning that island residents who arrived from mainland France or elsewhere in the past 25 years do not have the right to take part in provincial polls.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The French government has branded the exclusion of one out of five people from voting as "absurd", while separatists fear that expanding voter lists would benefit pro-France politicians and reduce the weight of the Kanaks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland scored twice to settle Manchester City's nerves as the Premier League champions beat Tottenham 2-0 to take a giant step towards a historic fourth consecutive English title on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Norwegian forward tapped home a pinpoint Kevin De Bruyne cross early in the second half to score City's first-ever league goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and netted a late penalty to seal the three points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It takes Pep Guardiola's team two points clear of Arsenal at the top of the table and means victory at the Etihad against West Ham on Sunday will make them champions for a fourth straight season, regardless of the Gunners' result against Everton.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 No team in English top-flight history has ever won four titles in a row.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Defeat for Spurs also guarantees that Aston Villa will finish in the fourth Champions League spot, joining City, Arsenal and Liverpool in Europe's top-tier competition next season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The build-up to the game in north London was dominated by a fierce debate over whether home fans wanted their own team to lose in order to leave City in the driving seat, with Arsenal their nearest challengers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Spurs supporters made their feelings towards their bitter local rivals clear in the opening minutes, with chants of "Stand up if you hate Arsenal" ringing around the stadium.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Both sides settled quickly and Spurs had the first sight of goal when a raking ball from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg found Brennan Johnson on the right.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Johnson squared for Rodrigo Bentancur, who unleashed a fierce shot that Ederson tipped over.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario kept out Phil Foden's close-range shot after 15 minutes with a strong right hand.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City, who came into the match on an unbeaten run of 21 matches, were short of their fluent best while Spurs struggled to put the finishing touches to their attacking moves.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The game opened up towards the end of the first period, with City defender Josko Gvardiol flashing a shot over the bar from a tight angle but the sides finished the opening 45 minutes with just one shot on target apiece.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Moments after the re-start Vicario was forced to dive full length to keep out a stinging De Bruyne effort while Son Heung-min went close at the other end after being found by Johnson.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But City broke the deadlock in the 51st minute when Bernardo Silva found De Bruyne in the box and the Belgian crossed for Haaland to slot home from point-blank range.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thousands of Spurs fans chanted "Are you watching Arsenal" as the City fans celebrated in their corner.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The game then became disjointed as first De Bruyne was hurt by a Pape Sarr tackle on his ankle before Ederson took a blow to the head in denying Cristian Romero and was replaced minutes later by Stefan Ortega.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The German was called into action immediately, keeping out substitute Dejan Kulusevski's close-range shot with his legs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visitors' hearts were in their mouths when Son burst through with five minutes of normal time remaining but Ortega saved with his legs when he seemed likely to score.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Guardiola fell to the ground, clutching his head in disbelief.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead City were awarded a penalty when Pedro Porro brought down substitute Jeremy Doku and Haaland smashed home in the 91st minute to spark wild celebrations from the players in front of the City faithful, taking his league tally to 27 goals for the season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year's treble winners will prepare for Sunday's finale knowing they stand just 90 minutes away from creating another slice of football history. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq finished at a new record on Tuesday as US stocks rallied, shrugging off data that showed April wholesale inflation that topped expectations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-focused index closed at 16,511, up 0.8 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 39,558, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,246.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US wholesale prices jumped by 0.5 percent in April, much above estimates in a dynamic that could keep Federal Reserve interest rates higher for longer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, analysts noted that the gain was offset by a revision to the March report, which showed wholesale inflation cooling in that period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The numbers were more or less in line," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, who pointed to Wednesday's consumer price report as a key test for stocks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the first quarter as "notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," adding that "we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet rose 0.6 percent as the tech giant highlighted its artificial intelligence offerings at a developer conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Home Depot dipped 0.1 percent after reporting a decline in first-quarter revenues as it pointed to "continued softness" in some consumer segments. The home-improvement retailer confirmed its full-year forecast.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 GameStop jumped 60.1 percent and AMC Entertainment 32 percent in a revival of the so-called "meme stock" craze from 2021. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai rights activist detained on royal defamation charges died on Tuesday while on hunger strike in custody, the kingdom's department of corrections said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Netiporn Sanae-sangkhom, an activist from the pro-democracy "Thaluwang" group, had been held in pre-trial detention since January.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was charged under Thailand's tough royal insult laws over a royal motorcade protest in 2020 during the peak of the kingdom's youth-led pro-democracy movement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some of the world's strictest lese-majeste laws protect King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each offence carrying a potential 15-year sentence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 28-year-old went on hunger strike shortly after detention to protest against the Thai justice system, and was immediately transferred to the medical correctional hospital over health concerns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the statement released by the department of corrections, Netiporn – also known by her nickname "Boong" – suffered from weak legs and arms as well as anaemia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She refused "minerals and vitamins" given by the hospital, the statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "She had a cardiac arrest on Tuesday morning and wasn't responsive to the treatment, which led her to die peacefully at 11:22 am (0422 GMT)," the statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that the hospital will conduct an autopsy to identify the cause of death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Southeast Asian regional branch of the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it was "deeply disturbed" by Netiporn's death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We call for transparent & impartial investigation into her death & care. Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental rights," the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the Human Rights Lawyer Association, there are at least two political prisoners in Thailand who went on hunger strike.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2023, two Thai hunger strikers held under royal insult law were given temporary release over health concerns. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert was fined US$75,000 by the NBA on Tuesday for what the league called "making an inappropriate and unprofessional gesture" questioning "the integrity of the league and game officials."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Frenchman Gobert was seen by television cameras rubbing his thumb on his fingers in a "money-sorting" gesture during Minnesota's 115-107 loss to defending NBA champion Denver on Sunday at Minneapolis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The move came after Gobert was whistled for a foul with 4:10 remaining in the fourth quarter, his second foul in as many Denver possessions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gobert won his record-tying fourth NBA Defensive Player of the Year award last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The defeat left the T-Wolves and Nuggets level at two wins each in their best-of-seven Western Conference second round series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The NBA said the fine takes into account Gobert's "history of improper conduct toward game officials."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gobert was fined US$100,000 by the NBA on March 10 for making the same gesture in a 113-104 overtime loss at Cleveland two nights earlier.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After that contest, Gobert said gambling was hurting the sport. (AFP)

    Palestinians rally at historic villages in Israel

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people took part on Tuesday in an annual march through the ruins of villages that Palestinians were expelled from during the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wrapped in keffiyeh scarves and waving Palestinian flags, men and women rallied through the abandoned villages of Al-Kassayer and Al-Husha – many holding signs with the names of dozens of other demolished villages their families were displaced from.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Your Independence Day is our catastrophe," reads the rallying slogan for the protest that took place as Israelis celebrated the 76th anniversary of the proclamation of the State of Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The protest this year was taking place against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Gaza, where fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas has displaced the majority of the population, according to the United Nations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among those marching on Tuesday was 88-year-old Abdul Rahman al-Sabah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He described how members of the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary group, forced his family out of Al-Kassayer, near the northern city of Haifa, when he was a child.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They "blew up our village, Al-Kassayer, and the village of Al-Husha so that we would not return to them, and they planted mines," he said, his eyes glistening with tears.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The family was displaced to the nearby town of Shefa-Amr.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But we continued (going back), my mother and I, and groups from the village, because it was harvest season, and we wanted to live and eat," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We had nothing, and whoever was caught by the Israelis was imprisoned."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Palestinians remember this as the "Nakba", or catastrophe, when around 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the war that led to the creation of Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who managed to remain in what became Israel presently number about 1.4 million, around 20 percent of Israel's population. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank's long-term target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The first quarter in the United States was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," the head of the US central bank said during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected," he continued. "And so what that has told us is we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Fed has held interest rates at a 23-year high as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After making progress for much of last year, the rate at which consumer prices have been rising has accelerated since the start of 2024, pushing back expectations of interest rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Powell said that, while he still expected inflation to move back down towards the levels seen last year, "my confidence in that is not as high as it was having seen these readings in these first three months of the year."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But despite the recent uptick in inflation, Powell said he did not think it was necessary to raise rates from their current "restrictive" levels.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is," he added. (AFP)

    Georgia passes so-called 'foreign influence' bill

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Georgian police were out in force to stop protesters interrupting the passage of the bill. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753183_1_20240515002412.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia's parliament on Tuesday adopted a controversial "foreign influence" law that has sparked weeks of mass protests against the measure, which Brussels has warned would undermine Tbilisi's European aspirations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmakers voted 84 to 30 in favour during the third and final reading of the law, which was widely denounced as mirroring repressive Russian legislation used to silence dissent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The vote came as street protesters skirmished with riot police outside the building in the centre of the capital, where demonstrations have taken place over the last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scuffles had broken out inside the chamber earlier as opposition lawmakers clashed with members of the ruling Georgian Dream party.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Critics say the bill is a symbol of the ex-Soviet republic's drift closer to Russia's orbit over recent years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Around 2,000 mainly young protesters gathered outside parliament and chanted "no to the Russian law," as news spread that lawmakers had adopted the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tbilisi has seen weeks of mass rallies over the bill that culminated on Saturday, when up to 100,000 people took to the streets in the largest anti-government rally in Georgia's recent history.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EU has said the law is "incompatible" with Georgia's longstanding bid to join the 27-nation bloc, while Washington has warned its adoption would signal Tbilisi's departure from the Western orbit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The US Assistant Secretary of State, James O'Brien, on Tuesday met in Tbilisi with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, whose office said each had "expressed their concerns" over recent developments in Georgia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UK Secretary of State for Defence, Grant Shapps, labelled the foreign influence law an act of "Russian interference in Georgia."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov hit back, accusing the West of "undisguised interference in Georgia's internal affairs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said that he would be travelling on Tuesday to Georgia together with his counterparts from Iceland, Estonia and Latvia to express "our concerns."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Both protesters and the ruling Georgian Dream party have vowed not to back down and fresh rallies have been called.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some protesters say their ultimate goal is to vote out Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill requires NGOs and media outlets that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as bodies "pursuing the interests of a foreign power."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia has used a similar law to silence public figures and organisations that disagree with or deviate from the Kremlin's views.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EU on Tuesday repeated its position that the bill undermines Tbilisi's desire to move closer to the bloc.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "EU member countries are very clear that if this law is adopted it will be a serious obstacle for Georgia in its European perspective," said its spokesman, Peter Stano.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, Georgia was granted official EU candidacy, and Brussels is set to decide in December on the formal launch of accession talks – an unlikely prospect after the law's adoption.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with the government, has vowed to veto the law, though Georgian Dream has enough lawmakers in parliament to override her veto.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This law is taking away my future," 19-year-old protester Anano Plievi said outside parliament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am angry, and proud of all these people at the same time. We are going to keep going towards Europe."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian society is staunchly anti-Kremlin. Georgia's bid for membership of the EU and NATO is enshrined in its constitution and – according to opinion polls – supported by a majority of the population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 NGOs and government critics have reported months of intimidation and harassment in the run-up to the bill being reintroduced in a targeted campaign that has escalated amid the tensions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian Dream has depicted the protesters as violent mobs, insisted it is committed to joining the EU, and said the bill is aimed at increasing transparency of NGO funding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The controversy surrounding the bill comes five months before a parliamentary election seen as a crucial democratic test for the Black Sea country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

    Mixed reactions to approved taxi fare increases

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 People are divided over the authorities' move to approve an increase in taxi fares, with some saying the rise is affordable and others complaining about poor taxi services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Executive Council has approved a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning from July 14, the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs, and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A student RTHK spoke to in Kowloon Tong said the fare increase is acceptable. However, he acknowledged that frequent taxi users may not be happy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am not a frequent user, so I think it is still affordable. But for some people, they may travel quite frequently on taxis. This may be a consideration for them," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A mother who often takes her children by taxi thinks that taxi drivers deserve a higher income for their hard work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think it's a big deal. I think they deserve more money because they work really hard and very long hours. Life has become more expensive, so we have to also expect that this increase needs to happen for the drivers, right?" she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A passenger said that taxi drivers should improve their services before they are allowed to increase their fares.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The price is a bit high considering their performance. The taxi service is so bad in Hong Kong. Nowadays, we don't have a way to reflect the performance of the taxi drivers. If they behave badly, we don't have a way to complain," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A taxi driver said he's worried that the fare hike could lead to a further drop in passenger numbers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "My concern is that if fares increase, we might see a drop in the number of passengers. Business is already tough, especially during the evening shift when fewer people go out."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, another taxi driver believes passengers will find the fare increase acceptable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's a reasonable increase. Passengers will eventually get used to it. Considering inflation, a slight rise in taxi fares should be acceptable to them," he said.

    Exco approves HK$2 rise in taxi flagfall rates

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi fares are set to go up after the Executive Council approved increases for cabs on Tuesday, but it was far from the jump the trade had asked for.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The industry had suggested a HK$5 increase in the flagfall for urban taxis, and set the initial charges for other cabs at HK$28.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead, the flagfall for urban taxis will increase from HK$27 to HK$29, while the starting rates will be HK$25.5 in the New Territories and HK$24 on Lantau.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The incremental charges will also be raised, with a 20-cent increase per metre jump for the first-tier distance after flagfall for urban taxis. Passengers of green and blue cabs will see the incremental rates after flagfall rise from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For second-tier distances, there will be an increase of 10 cents for all three types of taxis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The new fares are expected to take effect from July 14 after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A government spokesperson said it is important to review taxi fares to ensure a stable supply of services to cater for passengers' needs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade is facing genuine difficulty in maintaining the financial viability of its operation at the current taxi fare level," a statement read.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade hopes that an increase in taxi fares would raise the income of front-line drivers and attract more newcomers to join the industry, while at the same time encouraging taxi operators to improve their services and invest more in new facilities, thereby enhancing the overall taxi service quality and fostering the healthy development of the trade in the long run."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government also noted the approved increases were lower than the levels proposed by the taxi trade, adding the fare hike would “inevitably lead to higher transportation expenses for passengers”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Taxi charges last went up in July 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Kremlin also confirmed the trip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    Exco endorses plan to reform social worker board
   </title>
   <link>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers that will change the composition so that appointed members outnumber those elected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on the revamp, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the sector doesn't need to worry about the autonomy of the Social Workers Registration Board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At present, six of the board's 15 members are appointed, eight are elected and there is one official from the Social Welfare Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In future, 17 members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, Sun said governance of the body must be improved because it has deviated from the spirit of the law. He said, for example, the board had appointed to its disciplinary body a social worker who was facing a charge of rioting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun told reporters on Tuesday that in future, all board members must take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The board exercises public authority. What this means is that the registration of Hong Kong's 27,000 social workers, the disciplinary hearings involving them, all these are to do with public authority," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So requiring members of a statutory body exercising such authority to swear allegiance, this is only natural. It will ensure that members can safeguard our national security and that they uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the SAR government."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun said at least 14 of the 27 members of the board in future will be social workers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Everyone needs to understand that the source of social workers should actually be diverse. Some of them would be elected, others would be appointed," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The diversity at the board means that some of the social workers might be renowned professors, some might be respected leaders at social welfare organisations. This would allow for the board's operations to be more diverse and balanced."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the board will also be tasked with setting continuing professional development requirements for the sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government added in a statement that the relevant legal changes, if passed by lawmakers, will enable "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said the proposed legal changes will be gazetted on Friday, with a bill to be tabled to the legislature on May 22.

    'HK keen to promote global cooperation for prosperity'

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Tuesday said that Hong Kong is well-positioned to promote global collaboration and contribute to world prosperity, as the city kicked off its first-ever conference with a focus on geopolitics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at the inaugural “Global Prosperity Summit 2024”, Ip warned that Hong Kong faces a “high degree of global geopolitical risks” due to the looming threats of “rising polarisation and political violence”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said these threats were challenging global governance, and have led to protectionist policies of tariff hikes, financial sanctions and export controls to “deny developing countries’ access to advanced technology”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The world is being factored into opposing geopolitical blocks, the free trade and investment environment over the past decades, which have helped hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, seems to belong to a bygone era,” Ip said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “With national elections in 64 countries, affecting 49 percent of the world’s population, taking place this year, politics seems to trump economics everywhere,” she added, noting that signs of polarisation and political violence were also on the rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ip said Hong Kong has a keen interest in promoting ways to resolve such issues, as it is a small but open economy that has a high degree of exposure to global risks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are a very international and cosmopolitan society, and we are very well-connected. We understand the cultures and political systems of mainland China as well as the culture and systems of the West, so we are well positioned, really, to maximise our role as a super connector and an intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world,” she told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Ip told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme the SAR is a very suitable place to host the prosperity summit given its reputation as a meeting point between East and West.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “This summit showcases Hong Kong as a platform for international dialogue and communication, because we are able to bring together experts, prominent scholars, former senior officials from all over the world to debate on the issues,” she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “When we have a free trade investment environment, everybody benefits, and we don’t want this to stop,” she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three-day summit event is sponsored by local businesses and the government and is co-hosted by the think tank Savantas Policy Institute which Ip chairs, covering topics such as de-globalisation, technological cooperation and climate change.

    Advances in imaging tech gives hope to stroke patients

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HKU researchers say advances in imaging technology have allowed more stroke patients to be treated effectively. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753099_1_20240514114851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A study from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday showed that more than a third of stroke patients who were treated beyond the traditional six-hour golden period had recovered well, offering hope to those once thought untreatable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The researchers studied more than 50 stroke patients who were treated beyond six hours, with the most notable case being a patient who was treated 22 hours after his stroke.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the HKU researchers, Associate Professor of Surgery Kevin Cheng, explained that the key to this medical breakthrough lies in advances in imaging technology, which now allows doctors to assess the proportion of brain cells that can be saved, enabling more targeted interventions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In the past, if we just base on a plain CT scan, we cannot estimate the area of the brain having damage. We can just see if there is any blood," he said
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But with the advancement in the CT perfusion, we can differentiate...which part of the brain is still salvageable and the total volume and the mismatch ratio. So these factors are very accurate and can help us to accurately differentiate those patients who can benefit."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acute ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Brain cells can quickly die while the flow of oxygen and nutrients is restricted, leading to loss of brain function, paralysis, speech problems and even death.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Tuesday said the SAR saw 3.4 million visitor arrivals in April – a 17 percent increase year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said provisional figures show about 2.5 million of the arrivals, or 73 percent, were from the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said there was an increase of more than 50 percent in arrivals from other countries compared to April last year, with a more than 80 percent rise from Indonesia, driven by the end of Ramadan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, visitor arrivals from long-haul markets such as the US and Canada increased by more than 80 percent year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said about 14.6 million visitor arrivals were recorded in the first four months of the year, which was double the figure from the same period in 2023.

    Interfering with HK's trade offices will backfire: CE

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.

    Tourists from 8 mainland cities to get HK$200 vouchers
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists hailing from eight mainland cities will be welcomed with HK$200 vouchers for restaurants and shops, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, the central government added eight new cities, including Urumqi, Hohhot and Heilongjiang to the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), allowing residents to travel to the SAR without joining a tour group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he expects visitors from the eight cities to provide a large boost to Hong Kong's tourism sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The IVS is the main source of tourists for Hong Kong. It contributed 60 percent of all mainland tourist arrivals last year. The eight cities come with large populations and they also have significant economic growth, with high spending power," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The eight cities are located in the north, northwest and northeast of China respectively. They are further away from Hong Kong, when compared with the other cities under the IVS. This will bring in a lot of overnight visitors, largely increase per capita spending, and revenues from tourism and related sectors will increase exponentially."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee said the authorities have a series of measures to attract more tourists, including the HK$200 vouchers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that a drone show at the weekend received rave reviews.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our purpose is to let locals and visitors feel the joy, when they participate in these activities. We hope to use activities to bring liveliness, and use liveliness to bring more money," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people were injured on Monday after a sightseeing helicopter to Mount Aso, an active volcano in Japan, needed to make an emergency landing due to an engine failure mid-flight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Japanese pilot and two Hong Kong tourists were on tour to the Aso Nakadake Crater in Kumamoto prefecture, when the incident occurred at noon during its return to base.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The helicopter's engine failed and an emergency landing was made on a grassy field near the mountainous area, where all three were sent conscious to hospital for treatment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Immigration Department has followed up on the case with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Consulate in Fukuoka to provide assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit meant to reassure Ukrainians of continued American support and flow of weapons as Russia pummels the northeastern Kharkiv region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marking his fourth visit to Kyiv since the start of the war in February 2022, Blinken arrived by overnight train from Poland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Blinken will aim to reassure Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of enduring American support and deliver a speech focused on Ukraine's future.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kyiv has been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Russian troops have slowly advanced, mainly in the Donetsk region to the south, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of troop manpower and artillery shells.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia's forces hold a significant advantage in manpower and munitions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was trying to accelerate "the tempo of the deliveries" of weapons to Ukraine to help it reverse its disadvantage. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Tuesday said a secondary school teacher failed to return to Hong Kong after taking part in a four-day mainland study tour last week, following claims online that the educator was arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An online forum post suggested that a teacher of a subsidised school in Tin Shui Wai was picked up by mainland authorities while on a trip to Wuhan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said a mainland study tour for new teachers in Wuhan, which was held between May 8 and 11, wrapped up as scheduled, but it was notified that one member could not return to the SAR along with the group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Education Bureau attaches great importance to the discipline of participating teachers, and has required the school submit a report. The bureau will also comprehensively review relevant information and handle the case seriously. No further comments will be made at this stage," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The bureau will maintain close contact with the school and continue to follow up on the incident."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Education authorities also said teachers participating in mainland study tours must depart and return to Hong Kong as scheduled, and that they are reminded to be careful with their words and actions and to be law-abiding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Any cases of professional misconduct would be strictly followed up in accordance with the established mechanism, the bureau added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 RTHK has reached out to the school in question for comment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753080_1_20240514102308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics fought off a spirited challenge from short-handed Cleveland Monday, beating the Cavaliers 109-102 to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference semi-final series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jayson Tatum scored 33 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jaylen Brown added 27 points for the Celtics, who will try to finish off the best-of-seven series at home on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cavaliers were dealt a heavy blow when Donovan Mitchell, who had averaged more than 35 points over the six prior games, was ruled out with a calf injury, joining starting centre Jarrett Allen on the sidelines.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 NBA superstar LeBron James, who led the Cavs to their only NBA title back in 2016, was sitting courtside, but with Mitchell absent the Cavs ultimately didn't have enough firepower.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cavs kept the pressure on, taking the lead briefly on Darius Garland's driving basket early in the third quarter – their first lead since the first quarter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the Celtics quickly reasserted themselves and led by 10 going into the final period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cleveland, on the back of 30 points from Garland, pulled within five points three times in the final four minutes, but Brown, fed by Tatum, connected on a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that effectively sealed it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a game of runs," Tatum said after the Celtics struggled to put the depleted Cavaliers away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's not going to be perfect every single time. They're going to make shots, but it's our job to figure it out." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, preparing for his first professional fight since 2005, warned YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on Monday that his life will be on the line during their July 20 bout.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 57-year-old Tyson, speaking at New York City's Apollo Theater during a press conference to promote a fight against an opponent who is 30 years his junior, said he wants to show the world he is still a great fighter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I really like Jake a lot but once he's in that ring he has to fight like his life depends on it, because it will be," said Tyson.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The heavyweight bout at the Arlington, Texas home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys will be contested over eight two-minute rounds with each fighter using 14-ounce gloves. The outcome will be included in both fighters' professional boxing records.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tyson, who said he requested the shorter rounds because he feels it will lead to greater action and a more entertaining fight, shot back at critics who suggested he is making a big mistake by returning to boxing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The people who said that wish they were up here," said Tyson. "Because no one else can do it. Who else can do this? Who else can shut the sporting world down, no one else can do it. So you got the both of us.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We're friends, but in that ring we're not going to be friends."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tyson also said he did not hesitate at the chance to fight Paul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It was a no-brainer," said Tyson.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He was the new up and coming guy on the scene and I like shaking the sports world to it's core and I'm doing it now. It's just something I want to do."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Paul, a 27-year-old YouTube influencer-turned-boxer, has won nine of 10 boxing matches with six knockouts against a mix of celebrities and middling fighters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He suffered his sole career boxing loss in February 2023 when he lost a split decision to Tommy Fury, the half brother of World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Tyson Fury. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel battled Hamas in Gaza on Monday, including in far-southern Rafah, despite US warnings against a full-scale invasion of the crowded city and of the threat from post-war anarchy or insurgency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Clashes also raged in northern and central Gaza as Israel marked a sombre Memorial Day, followed by Independence Day from Monday night, more than seven months into the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israelis marked a moment's silence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that "our war of independence is not over yet. It continues even today... We are determined to win this struggle."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 AFP correspondents in Gaza reported helicopter strikes and heavy artillery shelling in the east of Rafah, as well as battles in northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel last week defied a chorus of warnings -- including from top ally Washington which paused a shipment of bombs -- and sent tanks and troops into the east of Rafah to pursue militants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The city on the Egyptian border had been sheltering 1.4 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations, but Israel's military operation sparked an exodus of nearly 360,000 people from Rafah so far, said the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agency warned that "no place is safe" in the territory, much of which has been reduced to a grey landscape of rubble.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington had not seen any credible Israeli plan to protect civilians in Rafah, and that "we also haven't seen a plan for what happens the day after this war in Gaza ends".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Israel's on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas," he told NBC. (AFP)

 Substitute Jhon Duran scored two late goals as Aston Villa fought back to salvage a 3-3 home draw with Liverpool on Monday and take a significant step towards a place in the Champions League next season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A match that started with Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez conceding a shocking second minute own-goal turned into a thriller with Duran coming on to save the night with goals in the 85th and 88th minutes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Villa are now on 68 points with one game remaining, five clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur who have two matches still to come.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Liverpool were gifted the opener when Argentine international Martinez fumbled a tame Harvey Elliot cross, desperately clawing the ball across the line and into his own net.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Villa, who would have secured fourth place with a win and must now wait for Tottenham's home game against title-chasers Manchester City on Tuesday, equalised 10 minutes later through Youri Tielemans.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cody Gakpo made it 2-1 to the third-placed visitors in the 23rd, after a VAR check for offside, and Jarell Quansah then headed in off the post from a free kick for his first Premier League goal in the 48th. (Reuters)
