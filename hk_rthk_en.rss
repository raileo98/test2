<div class="itemFullText">
 Scotland recorded an increase in drug deaths last year, official figures showed on Tuesday, as the country continues to have one of the highest rates of such deaths in Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deaths by drug misuse have blighted some of Scotland's poorest communities for decades and are often branded its "national shame."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Records of Scotland (NRS) said drugs claimed the lives of 1,172 Scots in 2023 – up 121, or 12 percent, from 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland had recorded its lowest drug death figures in five years in 2022, sparking hopes that the country had turned a corner in its fight against drug misuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 279 fewer people died from drug misuse that year compared to 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer-term trend shows that drug misuse deaths are still much more common than they were over two decades ago," said Phillipa Haxton of the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opioid drugs – such as heroin and methadone – were implicated in 80 percent of all drug deaths last year, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures also highlighted a growing threat from super-strong synthetic opioids such as nitazenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They showed that the number of men who died from drug misuse rose by 113 in 2022 to 805 last year, with men twice as likely to die as women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cities of Glasgow and Dundee had the highest rates of death, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People in the most deprived areas of Scotland are more than 15 times as likely to die from drug misuse compared to people in the least deprived areas," said the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland regularly appears at the top of studies measuring drug deaths per million people in European countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the UK, the drug misuse mortality rate was 2.7 times higher in Scotland than in England and Northern Ireland using data from 2022. (AFP)

    US official says Netanyahu remarks 'not constructive'

Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766963_1_20240821021949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US official on Tuesday criticised "maximalist" remarks attributed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on maintaining control of the Gaza-Egypt border, saying it was not helpful to reaching a ceasefire with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Maximalist statements like this are not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line," said the senior official travelling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the Middle East, requesting anonymity to talk about sensitive discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such remarks "certainly risk the ability of implementing-level, working-level and technical talks to be able to move forward (once) both parties agree to a bridging proposal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that Blinken stood by his public statement in Tel Aviv on Monday that Netanyahu had agreed to a US proposal to bridge the gaps on a ceasefire laid out on May 31 by President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, in reported remarks to families of victims of attacks, said that Israel would insist on maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor between Gaza and Egypt which Israeli forces seized from Hamas in the more than 10-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We saw the prime minister's comments, especially on some of these items. We're not going to negotiate in public," the US official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that such "technical" issues would need to be ironed out in further discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing Secretary Blinken and the United States are convinced of is the need for getting the ceasefire deal across the finish line," the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be additional conversations on technical specifics, many of which of course are being discussed in the press, which is certainly not helpful to the process," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States expects diplomacy to move forward this week between Israel and Hamas on reaching a ceasefire, despite uncertainties in particular on Hamas's response, the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We fully expect this process to continue into this week," the official said, without confirming any formal meeting this week involving Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House last week, when presenting the bridging proposal in Doha, said that it expected new talks on finalising the deal to take place later this week in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived in Doha late Tuesday for talks with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, after meeting the leaders of Egypt and Israel. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Vladimir Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766960_1_20240821011916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday likened Ukraine's incursion into Russia to the 2004 Beslan school massacre, in which some 330 people died in a hostage siege.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin visited the school for the first time in almost 20 years, paying tribute to the victims at memorials, including a cemetery and the site of the destroyed school, where Chechen militants took more than 1,000 people hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meeting mothers who lost children in the siege, Putin said that Russia's enemies are again trying to destabilise the country, referring to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just as we fought the terrorists, today we have to fight those who are carrying out crimes in the Kursk region," Putin said, referring to Ukraine's cross-border offensive that began two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But just as we achieved our goals in the fight with terrorism, we will achieve these goals also in this direction in the fight with neo-Nazis," Putin added, sitting opposite three women from the Mothers of Beslan group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And we will undoubtedly punish the criminals, there can be no doubt of that," Putin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mothers of Beslan group has long called for an objective probe into the attack and the Russian authorities' response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The September 2004 siege lasted some 50 hours, ending in a gunfight when Russian special forces stormed the building following explosions in the school gym, where the hostages were being held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege in the Caucasus region of North Ossetia came amid a guerilla insurgency by Islamist Chechen separatists, branded "terrorists" by Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin launched a major Russian offensive to quash Chechnya's armed bid for independence in late 1999, weeks before becoming president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war against the Chechen insurgency helped fuel Putin's initial popularity, but at the end of 2019 he described the Beslan siege as a "personal pain" that would remain with him for life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin and the Kremlin were criticised for their handling of the attack at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the meeting with Putin, the Mothers of Beslan complained that Russia's investigation into the school siege has never been completed, the group's co-chairwoman Aneta Gadiyeva told the Agentstvo news outlet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This part of the meeting, unlike Putin's remarks about Ukraine, was not televised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gadiyeva said Putin told the women that he had not known this and would ask the head of the Investigative Committee to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that Russia's handling of the siege had "serious failings" in terms of preventing the attack and its use of excessive lethal force and called on Moscow to take measures to establish the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came two years after Chechen fighters took hundreds hostage in a Moscow theatre, a stand-off which saw more than 130 killed – most by sleeping gas pumped into the theatre by Russian special forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack," the Kremlin press service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also laid red roses at a monument to members of Russia's special forces who died during the storming of School Number One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An "international cultural and patriotic centre for the prevention of terrorism" has been set up at the site of the former school, the Kremlin's press service said on Telegram. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World men's number one Jannik Sinner has been cleared of fault or negligence after failing two drug tests in March, the International Tennis Integrity Authority (ITIA) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An independent tribunal accepted Sinner's explanation that the contamination of banned substance clostebol happened when a member of his support team applied an over-the-counter spray on to treat a small wound of their own earlier this year, the ITIA said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That support team member applied the spray between 5 and 13 March, during which time they also provided daily massages and sports therapy to Sinner, resulting in unknowing transdermal contamination," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ruling is subject to appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the ITIA added. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday said it opposes a report by Bloomberg which quoted US firms as saying they were concerned about the city’s proposed new legislation to enhance cybersecurity of critical infrastructures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bloomberg said in its report earlier that some US tech firms had warned that the proposed cyber regulations could grant the SAR government “unusual access” to their computer systems; and giving authorities “overly broad powers” could threaten the integrity of service providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article also said the American Chamber of Commerce and Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce have also submitted letters during the public consultation period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR administration called Bloomberg’s report biased, saying it had taken the views of the submissions out of context.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the one-month consultation of the legislative framework ended on August 1, the HKSAR Government received 53 submissions, in which 52 submissions supported the legislation and made constructive suggestions, including those from the Asia Internet Coalition, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,” a government statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The proposed legislative framework only concerns protecting the Critical Computer Systems (CCSs) of the Critical Infrastructure Operators (CIOs), which in no way involves the personal data and business information.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out that similar legislation already exists in other jurisdictions, such as the mainland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the European Union and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “CIOs have the responsibility of properly responding to cyberattacks. Only when a CIO is unwilling or unable to respond to an incident on its own would the Commissioner's Office consider applying to a Magistrate for a warrant to connect to the CCSs or install programmes in the CCSs in view of necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and public interest,” the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the administration will continue to engage industry stakeholders in formulating the legislative regime and the related Codes of Practice.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Democratic Republic of Congo Health minister Samuel-Roger Kamba announces a dramatic rise in cases in his country.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mpox outbreak is not another Covid-19, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday, because much is already known about the virus and the means to control it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While more research is needed on the Clade 1b strain which triggered the UN agency into declaring an international health emergency, the spread of mpox can be reined in, the WHO's European director Hans Kluge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mpox is not the new Covid," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know how to control mpox. And, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether," he told a media briefing in Geneva, via video-link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July 2022, the WHO declared an emergency over the international outbreak of the less severe Clade 2b strain of mpox, which mostly affected men who have sex with men. The alarm was lifted in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We controlled mpox in Europe thanks to the direct engagement with the most affected communities," said Kluge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robust surveillance, investigating case contacts, behaviour changes in the affected communities and vaccination all contributed to controlling the outbreak, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said the risk to the general population was low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we going to go in lockdown in the WHO European region, (as if) it's another Covid-19? The answer is clearly: 'no'," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is spreading mainly through sexual transmission among adults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said it was also possible that someone in the acute phase of mpox infection, especially with blisters in the mouth, may transmit the virus to close contacts by droplets, in circumstances such as in the home or in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The modes of transmission are still a bit unclear. More research is required," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency was not recommending the use of masks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not recommending mass vaccination. We are recommending to use vaccines in outbreak settings for the groups who are most at risk," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO declared an international health emergency on August 14, concerned by the rise in cases of Clade 1b in the DR Congo and its spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two subtypes of mpox: the more virulent and deadlier Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is a new offshoot of Clade 1, which is now called Clade 1a.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clade 1b outbreak in northeastern DRC was first detected in September last year and is spreading rapidly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Smallwood, WHO Europe's emergency operations programme area manager, explained that the split of Clade 1 into 1a and 1b reflects "change in the evolution of the virus."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1a traditionally has outbreaks resulting from infections from sick animals, with some limited follow-on transmission between humans at the household level, or within communities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with Clade 1B, "we have not isolated or detected zoonotic transmission of Clade 1b," said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it seems to be a strain of the virus that's circulating exclusively within the human population."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts are trying to work out if there is a difference in disease severity between Clades 1a and 1b.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The available vaccines were originally developed for smallpox, and are effective against other viruses in the wider orthopoxvirus family, such as mpox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two mpox vaccines have been used in recent years – MVA-BN, produced by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, and Japan's LC16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also ACAM2000, a second-generation smallpox jab approved in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether a person vaccinated post-exposure to mpox goes on to develop the disease depends on the early administration of the vaccine, said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vaccines can also be used preventatively in people likely to be exposed to the virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jasarevic said results from effectiveness studies indicated that a good level of protection was provided against mpox following vaccination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty secondary students who recently returned from a young astronaut training camp have described their experience as rewarding and inspirational, saying they hope to follow in the footsteps of China's astronauts and make history one day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The teenagers were selected from a pool of around 200 applicants and went through a rigorous screening process, with three rounds of interviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over nine days from late July, they visited the Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Gansu province and the National Time Service Centre in Xi'an.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They even got a chance to meet Liu Yang, China's first female astronaut who was part of the Shenzhou-9 mission in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 of the students met the press at the Space Museum in Tsim Sha Tsui on Tuesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Alex Ngan, who said he was impressed by the progress achieved by the nation on space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went from a satellite that could only know how to repeat one singular song to a space station - it's simply unthinkable," the year eight student from the Canadian International School of Hong Kong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To see the sites that these historic events unfolded and to actually hear from the professionals that work in this field is an amazing experience and I will remember it forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng Tin-ho, a secondary five student from Tsang Pik Shan Secondary School, was touched by the professionalism of workers at the space centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They work in very remote locations, far away from their families and had to endure extreme temperature changes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But they remain dedicated, devoting their lives to what they are most passionate about. I hope I can do the same in the future and contribute to society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest tour was fully sponsored by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now in its 13th edition, the training camp admits 30 students every year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has approved 11 nuclear reactors across five sites, state media reported, as the country continues its push to combat rising emissions from fossil fuels.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Premier Li Qiang presided over a State Council executive meeting on Monday that gave the green light to the projects, Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China National Nuclear Power received approval for three reactors, the company said in a statement on WeChat, while State Power Investment Corp said it had received approval for two units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CGN Power Co, the listed unit of China General Nuclear Power Corp, said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing that it received approvals for six reactors in three sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China currently has 56 operating reactors, accounting for around 5 percent of its total electricity generation, according to the World Nuclear Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new reactors will be spread across Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, China Energy News reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Business news outlet Jiemian reported the total investment for all 11 reactors was expected to exceed 220 billion yuan, with construction taking around five years. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the United Front Work Department has stressed that the continuous development of the One Country, Two Systems principle in Hong Kong is playing an important role in China's reunification.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a speech at a conference held in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Shi Taifeng said the SAR is key to the country's reunification efforts, adding that compatriots in the city have all along loved the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continuous development of the implementation of One Country, Two Systems in Hong Kong will provide important reference and play an important role realising the complete reunification of the motherland," Shi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are more confident and capable than ever before to realise the nation's reunification."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Politburo member said that "Taiwan independence" is a dead-end and the initiative to resolve the Taiwan issue has always been on the side of the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current situation across the Taiwan Strait is complex," Shi said in the speech at the Overseas Chinese World Conference for Promoting Peaceful Reunification of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anti-China forces in the West have resorted to any means to inhibit China's development and intensified their efforts to use Taiwan to contain China. The Democratic Progressive Party has been stubbornly insisting on 'Taiwan independence' and inciting cross-strait confrontation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of Beijing's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said seeking reunification is an aspiration of the Chinese people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History has shown that all attempts to oppose China and seek independence would not succeed. When it comes to safeguarding national unity, no one should misjudge the country's firm determination and strong capabilities," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, called on people to "tell the good story of China's reunification".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's success since its return to the motherland has fully demonstrated that One Country, Two Systems is a good system for solving problems left over by history, and for promoting world peace and development," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1,200 people attended the conference in Hong Kong, the second time the SAR has held the event.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures released on Tuesday showed that overall consumer prices in Hong Kong rose by 2.5 percent last month compared with the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That inflation figure was larger than the corresponding increase of 1.5 percent in June and was the highest since November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed higher inflation data to the end of concessionary measures for ratepayers in June, and a rise in transport costs to and from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term. Domestic costs may face some moderate upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties," a government spokesman added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers are being urged to be more supportive of gamers, after a teenager from the SAR was crowned the world’s best Pokémon trainer this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng Yip-kai, who played under the username of “yekai0904”, took home Hong Kong's first Pokémon GO World Championship title and a US$20,000 prize after pulling off a 3-1 win against a Dutch opponent in the grand final in Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, 16, who bowed out early in last year’s competition in Japan, said in a post-match interview that his victory was proof of his dedication to the game and had been a chance to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former Hong Kong Pokémon Go team leader, Sam Cheung, told RTHK that there are currently about 50 active competitive players of the mobile game in the city and Cheng was the SAR’s sole representative this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Cheng had received criticism and insults following his early elimination last year, but showed his resilience with a victorious comeback this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he hoped Cheng’s success will change what people think of gamers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If you watch any live streaming of the Pokémon GO World Championship, you could see on many occasions Cheng used fluent Mandarin and English to do interviews. This shows that he could sharpen his language skills while playing video games. I believe if parents read Cheng’s story they will change how they view gamers,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lai Ching-lung from the University of Hong Kong sponsored Cheng's trip to Japan last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was happy to learn about the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai added that he hopes more people will participate in Pokémon GO and help pay for young gamers to compete overseas.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives from Israel at El-Alamein in Egypt on the next leg of his Mideast trip to secure a truce in Gaza. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766883_2_20240820165113.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Egypt on Tuesday for talks on a Gaza ceasefire as he pushes Hamas to accept a deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday, will afterwards head to Qatar, which along with Egypt is brokering negotiations for a truce in the 10-month Gaza conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His departure from Tel Aviv came as an Israeli kibbutz community announced the death in captivity in Gaza of 79-year-old hostage Avraham Munder, underlining the urgency of a truce and hostage release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kibbutz Nir Oz said Munder had endured "physical and mental torture for months" and called his death "murder". There was no immediate comment from his captors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat flew to El Alamein, the Mediterranean city famous for a World War II battle in 1942, to speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at his summer palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will then head to meet Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha, the scene of ceasefire talks last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Doha negotiations, the United States presented proposals to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas and seal the May 31 ceasefire blueprint laid out by US President Joe Biden, who has faced growing domestic criticism over the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said on Monday that Israel had accepted the US proposal and that he would speak to Egypt and Qatar to gauge the reaction of Hamas, which has no direct relationship with the United States as it considers the militants a terrorist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is, I think, a real sense of urgency here, across the region, on the need to get this over the finish line and to do it as soon as possible," Blinken said on Monday in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States is deeply committed to getting this job done, to getting it done now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also said the ceasefire proposal could be the "last chance" for a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He played down a public rejection by Hamas of the modifications in the latest proposal and said Israel was ready to send a delegation to new talks later this week, which the United States previously said would take place in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A series of reports suggested that Israel has raised new conditions in recent talks, including insisting on control of the Gaza border with Egypt that Israel seized from Hamas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property company Kaisa Group on Tuesday announced an offshore debt restructuring agreement with a key group of bondholders, swapping existing debt into new notes and shares in the company.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-based developer has been working to restructure its offshore debt since defaulting on US$12 billion in offshore bonds in late 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The restructuring plan also covers other debts, including loans and yuan-denominated asset-backed securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa is the second-largest offshore debt issuer among Chinese developers after China Evergrande Group and in 2015 became the first among its peers to default on dollar bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa said in a filing it will issue six tranches of senior notes maturing from 2027 to 2032 with 5 percent-6.25 percent cash interest and eight tranches of mandatory convertible bonds maturing from 2025 to 2032, which will be converted into shares in the company based on an allocation ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To facilitate deleveraging and enhance liquidity, the company added sponsors including chairman Kwok Ying-shing may contribute 115 million yuan of shareholder loan via one or more rights issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa may also elect to propose a management incentive plan to issue up to 3.33 percent ordinary shares of Kaisa and distributed to its personnel after a tranche of the new notes has been fully redeemed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa is due to face a winding-up petition hearing in Hong Kong on September 9, and a debt restructuring agreement will help to push back against the petition. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An emotional Joe Biden won a huge ovation as he gave a farewell speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, after Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance to thank him for being an "incredible" US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I love you," the tearful 81-year-old told the crowd to deafening cheers, less than a month after dropping out of the White House race against Donald Trump and passing the torch to his vice president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden took to the stage to chants of "We love you Joe" from the same party which had pushed him out over concerns about his age, in one of the biggest political shocks in US political history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We both know we have more to do, but we're moving in the right direction," he said, referring to himself and the 59-year-old Harris, who, in the space of a few breathtaking weeks, has turned the presidential race upside down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president has injected new life into the Democratic Party and wiped out Republican rival Donald Trump's lead in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She heaped lavish tribute on Biden, even breaking with tradition to speak on the first night of the convention in praise of her boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president Joe Biden," said Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are forever grateful to you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he has been so often in his five-decade-long political journey, Biden was surrounded by family, with wife Jill Biden and their daughter Ashley introducing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Joe and I have been together for almost 50 years. And still, there are moments when I fall in love with him all over again," the first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats are in an exuberant mood in Chicago, daring to hope for victory in November that seemed inconceivable just weeks ago after Biden's disastrous debate against Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Monday's first night of the convention was an emotional one on many levels, and for many of the key players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hillary Clinton, who lost against Trump in 2016 in her own bid to become America's first woman president, backed Harris to finally break the glass ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Something is happening in America, you can feel it -- something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time," the former secretary of state and first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris will formally accept the party's nomination on the final day Thursday, in her biggest chance yet to define her candidacy in front of a huge audience of tens of millions of American voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her star turn will cap a week where the biggest names from the party's past will endorse her as its future, with former president Barack Obama speaking on Tuesday, and ex-president Bill Clinton introducing Harris's running mate Tim Walz on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    US blames Iran for Trump campaign hack

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US security agencies on Monday said Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier in August that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns," the security agencies said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former president Trump's campaign, which the [intelligence community] attributes to Iran," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations denied the country's role in the hack and challenged Washington to release evidence for the claim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such allegations are unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing," the mission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbours neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the US presidential election. Should the US government genuinely believe in the validity of its claims, it should furnish us with the pertinent evidence -- if any -- to which we will respond accordingly," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States goes to the polls on November 5, with both Trump's and Democratic rival Kamala Harris's campaigns saying they had been targeted by cyber attacks in recent weeks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials say safety inspections have been ordered at Eastern Hospital after two pieces of concrete and part of a false ceiling came down in one of its wards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nobody was injured in the incident in the integrated medical and geriatric male ward at around 8.15pm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the pieces of concrete were 20 centimetres long, 30 centimetres wide and three centimetres thick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceiling was repaired and the ward is operating as usual, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital is very concerned about the incident and has arranged safety inspections to the facilities in the ward again immediately. The hospital is investigating the cause of concrete spalling," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital has regular inspection of hospital facilities and the last inspection at this area was in April last year."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, on Tuesday recorded the first senior Grand Slam victory of his career, after beating Chile's Cristian Garin in the first qualifying round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong went a set down, 4-6, before fighting back 7-6, 6-3 for the victory against Garin, who's now ranked 116th in the world but was once as high as 17th in 2021 and made it the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China player is currently ranked 38 spots lower than the Chilean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong will next play Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yu-hsiou in the second round of qualifiers. Hsu is ranked 185th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are three rounds of qualifiers in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draw for the main round of the men's singles will be made at Friday midnight, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Wong won the Australian Open junior doubles title two years ago.

    Sabalenka, Sinner victorious at Cincinnati Open final

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766839_1_20240820083919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka thrust herself into US Open title contention on Monday with a 6-3, 7-5 defeat of Jessica Pegula to win the 15th title of her career at the Cincinnati Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The third seed – who missed Wimbledon with a shoulder injury – won a trophy for the first time since collecting her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played in the final and that I was able to get this title. It's really important going into the US Open," Sabalenka said. "I'm sure Jess and I will have more battles in the future – let's keep it up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the men's draw, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe in straight sets to secure his maiden Cincinnati Open championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner claimed his fifth victory of the season in emphatic style, swatting aside Tiafoe 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in 1hr 36min to underscore his credentials for next Monday's US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian top seed bided his time in the first set before breaking the match open in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiafoe, whose game faded after losing the first-set tiebreaker, still made an impression. The American, who moves into the ranking top-20, saved three match points before Sinner claimed his 15th career title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cincinnati is the fifth trophy of 2024 for the 23-year-old Italian, who began the season with an Australian Open title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy, this was a very difficult week," Sinner said. "It was tough mentally but I tried to do my best. I'm just glad I kept my level in the important moments. I handled the situations on court well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Sinner's third in an ATP Masters event after previous victories in Toronto and Miami. (AFP)

 Dan Lawrence will open the batting for England in the first Test of a three-match series against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, while Matthew Potts has been drafted in to compensate for the loss of captain Ben Stokes to injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawrence has only operated as an opener a handful of times in his first-class career but returns to the England side for the first time in two-and-a-half years after Zak Crawley's fractured finger opened up a vacancy at the top of the order.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thierry Henry has decided to step down from his role as coach of the France under-21 football team, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former France international Henry made the decision after guiding the under-23 side to a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The all-time leading goalscorer for Premier League giants Arsenal took over as coach of the French youth side last summer and was under contract until June 2025 but decided to step away for "personal reasons", according to the FFF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry oversaw Les Bleuets' first run to the final of an Olympics men's tournament since winning gold in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His young side eventually went down 5-3 after extra time against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss ended a promising run that had started inauspiciously after Henry was obliged to make several changes to his squad pre-tournament, due to the refusal of certain clubs to release their players for the Games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Monday, extending last week's positive trend as markets await earnings from US retailers and central bank commentary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's results from big-box chains Target, Lowe's and TJX will offer additional clues about the state of the US economy following reassuring retail sales data last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today seems to be an extension of the positive trend" from last week, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, who noted a chance that low trading volumes amid the "dog days" of summer holidays could lead to outsized market moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,896.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,608, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 17,876.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks rallied last week following encouraging US economic data that offered reassurances after recession fears buffeted markets earlier in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, chip company AMD piled on 4.5 percent after announcing a US$4.9 billion deal to acquire ZT Systems, which provides server solutions for cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  General Motors gained 1.0 percent after confirming plans to trim its software and services workforce. The auto giant will cut more than 1,000 jobs, according to US media.

 Former US Representative George Santos pleaded guilty on Monday to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the federal fraud case that led to his expulsion from Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New York Republican entered the plea in a courtroom in Long Island just weeks before his trial was set to begin in early September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was indicted on felony charges that he stole from political donors, used campaign contributions to pay for personal expenses, lied to Congress about his wealth and collected unemployment benefits while actually working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was expelled from the US House after an ethics investigation found “overwhelming evidence” that he had broken the law and exploited his public position for his own profit. (AP)

    Trump posts images implying Taylor Swift supports him

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's Truth Social platform shared AI-generated images appearing to show he has Taylor Swift's support. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766817_1_20240820024552.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has shared doctored images on social media showing Taylor Swift and her fans support his presidential campaign, in an apparent effort to tap into the pop singer's mega star power in the US election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swift has not yet publicly thrown her weight behind any presidential candidate in the November 5 election, but she backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and has previously been critical of Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Trump shared screenshots of posts with manipulated images – including some that an expert said appeared to be AI-generated – suggesting that the pop star and her fans, popularly known as Swifties, support his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Truth Social post, which includes a poster of Swift clad in an Uncle Sam outfit and instructing her fans to vote for Trump, the former president wrote: "I accept!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That poster is either "AI generated or just classically manipulated," said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The post also includes photos of women wearing shirts with the slogan "Swifties for Trump," some of which Farid said had the "tell-tale signs of being AI generated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What makes the mash-up "particularly devious" is that is a combination of real and fake imagery, with at least one photo of a woman wearing such a shirt looking legitimate, Farid said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Swift about the post by Trump, who separately shared on Truth Social a video of a supporter voicing the dubious claim that "Swifties were rallying for Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's soaring popularity and sway over her fans could make her support valuable in the upcoming presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats have long wanted to count on her support, but the megastar has been largely reticent about her political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration of her star power, when Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote last fall, directing them to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, her plea had an immediate impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following her message, the institution said it recorded more than 35,000 new registrations, 23 percent more than last year and the most since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's feelers into politics have been heavily scrutinised, making her a ripe target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her reserve led many critics to speculate Swift was a closet Republican, until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right US Senator Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since spoken out in particular for the legal right to an abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, intense speculation has swirled on social media that Swift will endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The megastar has not commented publicly, but that has not stopped legions of fans to form a group called "Swifties for Kamala," attracting tens of thousands of followers on platforms such as Instagram and X, formerly Twitter. (AFP)

    City of Pokrovsk evacuated as Kremlin rules out talks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday ruled out entering peace talks with Ukraine over Kyiv's surprise offensive into Russian territory, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said was meeting its goals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine sent troops over the border on August 6 and has since held onto a part of the western Kursk region, in the biggest attack on Russian soil since Moscow attacked in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move has rattled Moscow and taken Ukraine's Western allies by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has said the offensive is aimed at stretching Russian forces, creating a "buffer zone" and bringing the conflict "closer" to an end on "fair" terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said on Monday that it had pushed the prospect of peace talks further away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the current stage, given this escapade, we will not talk."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called entering a negotiating process "completely inappropriate" and said future talks "depend on the situation on the battlefield, including in the Kursk region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow, intent on not letting the offensive affect its own advance in eastern Ukraine, claimed another village in the war-battered Donetsk region on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bracing for a further assault, Ukraine ordered the evacuation of families from the key city of Pokrovsk as Moscow's forces inched closer to the logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, meanwhile, said his troops in Kursk – who have set up administrative offices and published previously unthinkable footage of Ukrainian soldiers patrolling Russian streets – are meeting their targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are achieving our goals. This morning we have another replenishment of the (prisoner of war) exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to more Russian troops being taken prisoner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Zelensky said the push into Russian territory was designed to create a "buffer zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prospect of peace talks appeared distant even before Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin had demanded Ukraine cede swathes of territory if it wanted a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, who has ruled out direct talks with the Kremlin, demands Russia's full withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and reparations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, Ukraine has destroyed two key bridges over the Seym river inside Russia, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes to the combat zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bridge over the river was hit over the weekend, a Russian military investigator said in a video published by high-profile pro-Kremlin TV commentator Vladimir Solovyev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on the bridges have left Russia with limited options, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's defence ministry said on Monday Russia had thwarted Ukrainian attacks on three more villages in the Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has also been accused of sending inexperienced conscripts to protect the Kursk region, unwilling to redeploy experienced fighters from the frontlines in eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incursion has visibly worried Russians, prompting some in Kyiv to hope that sentiment could turn the country against the Kremlin's more than two-year war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accustomed to seeing the war as a television show, Russians are now seeing it up close and personal," Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you don't want to see the war, you have to end the war by forcing your 'leadership' to make peace on fair terms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, Moscow said it captured the town of Artemovo, which is called Zalizne in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zalizne had a population of around 5,000 at the start of 2022 – making it one of the largest places captured by Russian troops in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine also said Russian attacks killed four people in frontline towns on Monday, with a 71-year-old woman killed in her garden in Toretsk and three civilians in their 60s and 70s killed in the village of Zarichne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the front moved further west towards the city of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian officials announced the compulsory evacuation of families with children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are starting the forced evacuation of families with children from the Pokrovsk community," Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said, ordering the "compulsory" evacuation of children and their parents from Pokrovsk and about a dozen surrounding villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said more than 53,000 people live in the area, including almost 4,000 children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Filashkin called the decision to evacuate "necessary and inevitable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has long tried to capture Pokrovsk, which lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops. (AFP)

 Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan announced his retirement from international football on Monday after leading his country at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "After a few weeks of reflection, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to end my national team career," Gundogan said in a German FA statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look back with great pride on 82 international matches for my home country – a number that I could never have dreamed of when I made my debut for the senior national team in 2011."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan, who turns 34 in October, was in the Germany team that reached the Euro 2024 quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My highlight was clearly the huge honour of being able to lead the team as captain at our home European Championship last summer," said the Barcelona midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan made his debut for Germany against Belgium in October 2011 but missed their 2014 World Cup triumph with a back injury. He was also ruled out of Euro 2016 due to a dislocated kneecap. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Donahue, a pioneering US talk show host, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Donahue's death in Manhattan on Sunday following a long illness was announced on NBC's Today Show, where he made frequent appearances from 1979 to 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Phil Donahue Show," launched in 1967, was the first on daytime US television to feature audience participation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It remained popular through the 1970s and into the 1980s, earning Donahue numerous Emmy Awards, and the format was adopted by future talk show hosts such as Oprah Winfrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Donahue show was also notable for bringing conversations about controversial issues such as abortion, religion and sex to daytime television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Joe Biden in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He pioneered the live daytime talk show, holding a mirror up to America," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He interviewed everyone from our greatest stars to our forgotten neighbours, uniting us around the toughest issues of our time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue was married for 44 years to actress Marlo Thomas, the star of the 1960s sitcom "That Girl." (AFP)

    Blinken meets Israeli leaders at 'decisive moment'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken on Monday urged Israel and Hamas not to derail negotiations that he said may be a "last opportunity" to secure a Gaza truce and hostage release deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since Hamas's October 7 attack triggered the war, said he was back in Israel "to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a decisive moment – probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US secretary of state later met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and is due to travel on Tuesday to Egypt where ceasefire talks are expected to resume this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for delays in reaching a truce accord that diplomats say could help avert a wider conflagration in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places, and to greater intensity," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Months of on-off negotiations with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have failed to produce an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of talks in Qatar last week, Hamas called on mediators to implement a framework outlined in late May by US President Joe Biden, rather than hold more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire was "still possible" and that the United States was "not giving up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday, hours after Blinken had landed in the city, there was a bombing in Tel Aviv that was later claimed by the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One person – the bomber according to Israeli media – was killed and another wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The groups threatened to carry out more such attacks in Israel "as long as the occupation's massacres, the displacement of civilians and the policy of assassinations continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the bombing could have been more serious but the assailant detonated the explosives before managing to reach a more heavily populated area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as Israel and Hamas traded blame for delays in reaching a truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Qatar meeting last week, the United States submitted what mediators called a "bridging proposal," which Hamas on Sunday said "responds to Netanyahu's conditions" and includes terms that the Palestinian group would not accept.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas insisted on "a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip," saying Netanyahu wanted to keep Israeli forces at several strategic locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators," the Palestinian movement said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order for an agreement to be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Netanyahu said that Hamas "remains obstinate" and must be pressured, a day after his office said Israeli negotiators had expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators also reported progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to the prime minister's governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 40,139 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan announced by Biden at the end of May would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks while Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence raged on in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, an Israeli soldier and two Hezbollah fighters were killed in cross-border clashes, the Israeli military and the Lebanese militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In southern Gaza, a medical source said three people were killed in Abassan village and witnesses reported Israeli air strikes near the Islamic University in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops were operating in southern and central Gaza, and that the air force "struck over 45 terrorist targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It later said that it had "expanded" operations in Khan Younis and the outskirts of Deir el-Balah. A medical source said a baby girl was killed and several women wounded in air strikes west of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighting has devastated Gaza. A video posted to social media by a UN official showed a convoy passing scenes of utter destruction with almost every building reduced to rubble and the few still standing badly damaged. (AFP)

 Four people from Hong Kong have been arrested in Thailand on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thai authorities seized 14kg of heroin and said the suspects tried to send the drugs to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to an inquiry from RTHK, the Immigration Department said it has confirmed the identities of those arrested through the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added that it will follow up on the case.

    Govt ensures local workers get priority: Chris Sun

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Monday reassured local workers that the government would ensure they have priority in employment amid concerns about competition with non-local labour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun's remarks came a day after the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) called for the setting up of a mechanism that would trigger the suspension of labour importation schemes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FTU said local employees are facing challenges in finding jobs in the retail, catering and construction sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three sectors were included in labour importation schemes introduced by the government last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Sun stressed that companies should prioritise hiring local workers before turning to non-local labour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when companies fail to hire a sufficient workforce through local recruitment can they proceed to the next stage – to apply to import labour through industry quotas or general schemes. This demonstrates that the mechanism (of labour importation schemes) itself guarantees priority for local workers in employment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most importantly, if local workers show greater willingness to work, the number of imported labour will subsequently decrease."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The welfare minister also said the government is looking into setting up a database for high-risk caregivers after an elderly woman and her son, who had cared for her, were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the authorities will take privacy concerns into consideration.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the Hong Kong government will continue to fully and accurately implement the One Country, Two Systems principle and leverage the SAR's strengths to serve the country's needs as he met with the visiting head of the United Front Work Department, Shi Taifeng.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shi, who's also a Politburo member and vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is in Hong Kong on an inspection visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They exchanged views on issues of mutual interest in their meeting at Government House on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the SAR government will focus on creating strong impetus for growth, improving its governance system, resolutely implementing the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong", and strengthening Hong Kong's patriotic forces with a love for the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that the recent third plenary session of the Communist Party offered important guidance for the city's long-term development, prosperity and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Hong Kong government and all sectors of the community should earnestly learn, have a thorough understanding of and implement the spirit of the session.

 Equestrian athlete Natasha Tse left for Britain on Monday for two final weeks of training ahead of the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Growing up with cerebral palsy, which hinders movement and muscle control, Tse embraced horse-riding at a young age of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making her Paralympic debut in London at just 15, the veteran is gearing up for her fourth Games in early September, where she'll be competing in the individual para dressage event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this time, Tse is bringing two “horses”. Check out our video to find out why.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least one person was killed and six people were missing after a luxury yacht was struck by a whirlwind and sank off the coast of the Sicilian capital Palermo, Italian media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "One body was located in the wreck but not yet recovered, at a depth of around 50 metres," a coast guard spokesman told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's fire brigade and coast guard had earlier said divers were searching for seven missing people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 56-metre-long luxury sailboat, which was British registered, sank with 22 people on board when it was hit by a violent storm at sunrise, the coast guard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said one crew member and six passengers were missing, adding they were of British, American and Canadian nationality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight of those rescued, including a one-year-old child, were transferred to local hospitals and were all in a stable condition, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard named the yacht as the "Bayesian", which was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The luxury ship has an aluminium hull, can reach a maximum speed of 15 knots and can carry 12 guests and a crew of up to 10, according to specialist online yacht sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boat left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on August 14 and was last tracked east of Palermo on Sunday evening, with a navigation status of "at anchor", according to vessel tracking app Vesselfinder. (Agencies)

    Lower tax for companies sponsoring athletes: DAB

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vincent Cheng (centre) says companies prefer to sponsor sports events, rather than athletes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called on the government to offer tax concessions to businesses that sponsor local athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Cheng, who is also the vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), explained the number of companies sponsoring athletes was limited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of big companies that are really interested to support all the sports events. When we're talking about the marathon, the badminton competition, they do have a title sponsor," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [number of] companies supporting the athletes [is] not a lot. So, we hope that later on in the future, the government can encourage more companies to support the athletes directly, like supporting their salary or hiring them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also urged the government to purchase broadcasting rights for the upcoming 15th National Games, the 2026 Aichi-Nagoya Asian Games in Japan as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this would make it easier for residents to follow the competitions, rally behind home-grown athletes and provide a boost to the local catering and retail sectors.

    Cult of Alain Delon lives on in Japan
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alain Delon at a press conference in Tokyo in 1977. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766771_1_20240819164704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French movie star Alain Delon, who died Sunday aged 88, said that in Japan he was like a deity. It wasn't an exaggeration, local fans told AFP on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In Japan I am a kind of a god," Delon told Figaro Magazine in 1986 on one of his many visits to Japan, when women fainted and crowds chased his limousine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People get real pleasure from touching me, caressing my hand, kissing my fingers," he told the magazine, reporting on fans showering him with gifts from red roses to statuettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's breakthrough role in Japan was "Purple Noon" (1960) as the handsome, homicidal anti-hero for the original screen version of Patricia Highsmith's thriller "The Talented Mr Ripley".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon played an "ambitious roughneck who loved money, women, and was ready for anything," said Sahoko Hata, a film critic who worked in the Japanese movie industry at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This thirst symbolised that of Japanese youth at the time," Hata told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon made the first of many visits to Japan in 1963 to promote his films, but also increasingly to appear in television variety shows and at society events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His TV appearances frequently broke audience records and up until the mid-1970s he regularly topped rankings of the Japan's most popular celebrities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My friends in their 70s and 80s are still all madly in love with him. Even at 88, he looked great," Delon fan Seta, 74, told AFP on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I used to think to myself: 'How is it possible for such an attractive person to exist in this world?'," the pensioner said in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was handsome, elegant and slightly mysterious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Kaoru Fujita, a woman in her late 50s shopping in Tokyo with her daughter, Delon's name was "synonymous with 'the handsome man'."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I have to think of someone to compare him with, I would say George Clooney or Brad Pitt," she told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't think there is anyone who is as so classically handsome as he was. As an actor he was one of a kind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon gradually transformed himself into a sort of ambassador of French chic, becoming the face of Japanese fashion brand D'Urban and appearing in adverts for Mazda cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Alain Delon" brand was launched in 1978, mainly aimed at Japan and other Asian countries, selling accessories from watches and socks to cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1980s and 1990s, a Japanese tour operator even offered organised trips to Europe that featured a banquet in Paris in the presence of Delon himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extra paid options included having the honour of presenting Delon with a bouquet or having a souvenir photo taken with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon had a "dark, sad, mysterious, ambitious side, but also a bit of a loser", Yoshi Yatabe, a former programmer of the Tokyo International Film Festival, told AFP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This dark side really appealed to Japanese viewers who tend to like losers. In kabuki theatre, for example, the audience sympathises with the weakest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "France and Europe were a very far away place for me, so I would always wonder where he came from," remembered pensioner Mikiko Tsuburaya, 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was still a child, not a grown up yet (when he was popular). I would look at him as someone living in another world," the pensioner said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Monday said Premier Li Qiang would visit Russia and Belarus this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, China-Russia relations have eliminated external interference and maintained healthy and stable development," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Li's visit from Tuesday to Friday would include the 29th regular meeting between the Chinese and Russian heads of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mao said Li planned to "exchange in-depth views on practical cooperation in bilateral relations and issues of common concern" in talks with Russian counterpart Mikhail Mishustin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li's visit comes as China and Russia ramp up economic cooperation and diplomatic contacts.
  <br/>

  Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko visited China twice last year, promising in December to be a "reliable partner" to Beijing. (AFP)

    Japan to list Tokyo Metro in autumn

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Japanese and Tokyo governments are seeking to list Tokyo Metro as early as October, according to sources. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766761_1_20240819154408.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said Japan's national and Tokyo governments were seeking a 700 billion yen valuation for the Tokyo Metro as they prepare to list the subway operator as early as the end of October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  If the deal goes ahead, it would be Japan's biggest initial public offering (IPO) in roughly six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two governments, which own 100 percent of Tokyo Metro, plan to arrange a meeting of brokerages within a week for a briefing on the IPO and expect to receive approval for the listing from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as soon as mid-September, sources told the Reuters news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half the company to be sold, the IPO could raise 350 billion yen, which would exceed the size of Kokusai Electric's IPO last year and become the largest since SoftBank Group listed its wireless unit in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IPO follows the listing of other railway operators, including Kyushu Railway (JR Kyushu) in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro runs 195 kilometres of lines carrying 6.5 million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro's history dates back to 1920 with the establishment of the Tokyo Underground Railway Company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven years later, it opened Japan's first subway line, between the Asakusa and Ueno districts of Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company, whose business includes real estate and retail, reported net profit jumped by two-thirds to 46 billion yen in the financial year ended March 2024 as economic activity rebounded from the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central Japanese government, which owns 53.4 percent of Tokyo Metro, plans to use the funds raised to repay reconstruction bonds issued following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tokyo government holds the remaining 46.6 percent of the subway operator.
  <br/>

  Nomura, Mizuho and Goldman Sachs are the joint global coordinators for the listing. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that toilet rolls which hold up well in wet conditions may not break apart quickly after use and can clog sewage pipes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council said it tested 25 types of toilet paper rolls in accordance with mainland standards, comparing absorbency, strength, softness, ease of flushing and hygiene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the overall hygiene and standard of the toilet paper tested was satisfactory, but four types didn't disintegrate so well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When consumers buy toilet rolls, they need to make a choice, whether they want a tougher, stronger product to use, or to balance the implications to their toilet drains," said Consumer Council Chief Executive Gilly Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said it also found that many types of toilet paper lacked proper package labelling, omitting essential information such as the number of sheets per roll, dimensions, weight and expiry dates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged manufacturers to improve product labelling and to ensure that all necessary information is clearly displayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong cautioned people against stockpiling toilet rolls and reminded consumers that proper storage of toilet paper in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area is crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Toilet rolls are not vacuum packaged, so if it is put in a high humidity environment… It can easily get moist and have germs or mould,” she said.

    Sports shoe firms urged to improve product quality

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People who are unhappy with the quality or performance of a new pair of sports shoes should not be afraid to follow up with the retailer, as the consumer watchdog says there is a good chance they will be compensated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Manufacturers have also been told to do more to make sure their products live up to the increasing expectations from users, amid a steady stream of complaints against functional footwear in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 101 complaints regarding sports shoes between January and July, compared to 227 for the whole of last year, and 257 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A complainant was refunded 80 percent of the HK$1,170 he forked out for a pair of sports shoes which claimed to be waterproof, but weren't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water began seeping into the sneakers after he wore them about five times, and the problem persisted with a second pair that the store offered free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the shoes were sent back from the factory following an inspection, the man noticed the inner rubber trim began to peel off. But the manufacturer refused to repair the defect, triggering the complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's chief executive, Gilly Wong, offered some practical tips to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You really have to examine the product very carefully when you buy it, and if there's anything wrong, you should bring it forward to the retailer very promptly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on our experience in dealing with these kinds of complaints, the manufacturers are very willing to accommodate and settle the dispute, because they want to uphold their brand reputation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also urged manufacturers to devote more resources to maintain production quality, and not to just focus on design.

    President Xi Jinping meets Vietnam's leader in Beijing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping hosted Vietnam's new top leader To Lam in Beijing on Monday, in Lam's first overseas trip since being named general secretary of the country's Communist Party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi welcomed Lam with a military parade outside the Great Hall of the People, before the pair held talks and signed cooperation documents inside the state building off Tiananmen Square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the two ruling communist parties in the world today, China and Vietnam should uphold the original spirit of friendship, continue the traditional friendship...and continue to deepen the strategically important Sino-Vietnamese shared community of destiny," Xi told Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congratulating Lam, Xi said if the two countries adhered to a "common endeavour of promoting the cause of world socialism, we believe that our road will be wider and wider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Xi had guided China to become a "strong and prosperous country", and lauded him for developing Beijing's "role towards peace, cooperation and development in the region and the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was formally named Vietnam's leader earlier this month, pledging to "speed up" a sweeping anti-graft campaign that has snared thousands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ascension came two weeks after the death of Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades, who presided over the so-called "blazing furnace" crackdown on corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam had already assumed the largely ceremonial role of president in May after his predecessor resigned in the face of the vast anti-graft purge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But now as the Communist Party of Vietnam's general secretary, Lam is the most powerful figure in the country's leadership structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His three-day trip to China has already taken him to Guangzhou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last December, China and Vietnam pledged to deepen bilateral ties when Xi visited the country, his first time there in six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That trip came after Vietnam and the United States upgraded diplomatic ties during US President Joe Biden's visit in September 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam has long pursued a "bamboo diplomacy" approach, striving to stay on good terms with both China and the United States. (AFP)

    Tokyo shrine vandalised again: Japan authorities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tokyo shrine seen as a symbol of Japan's past militarism on Monday reported a second case of graffiti in three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo honours 2.5 million mostly Japanese killed in wars since the late 19th century, including convicted war criminals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials regularly pay homage at Yasukuni, as did three government ministers and scores of other lawmakers on the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such visits have angered some of Japan's Asian neighbours and former victims of its imperialism, especially China and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Yasukuni shrine official confirmed the new case of graffiti to reporters, without elaborating further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, a Chinese man allegedly conspired with two others to spray-paint the word "toilet" in red on a pillar at the shrine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jiang Zhuojun, 29, who lived north of Tokyo, was later arrested "on suspicion of vandalism and disrespect for a place of worship", Tokyo police said in July. (AFP)

    Newborn pandas doing well, still fragile: Ocean Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Monday said the two newborn pandas were doing well, but they remain fragile and it would probably take a few weeks before they started showing signs of strength.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park chairman, Paulo Pong, said veterinary experts were working behind the scenes to help Ying Ying care for the cubs that were born last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said on RTHK the park was thankful the Sichuan panda research centre had been providing the SAR with milk to feed the cubs, because Ying Ying doesn't have enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said the newborns have been eating and discharging well, and it would be another week or two before they grow black and white fur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mainly I think the key is how the babies eat. How much breast milk they can take in, and that they can feel the temperature from their mother - how they sleep and rest. All these are important aspects for newborn pandas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So now that we offer help artificially, on top of Ying Ying learning slowly how to care for the cubs, these things really complement each other. And we hope things will continue on smoothly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said it could take the newborns two months before they open their eyes, and learn how to walk some four months after birth. He said the theme park would try to give timely updates on the pandas, all while not giving too much pressure to the conservation experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the park would first discuss internally how it would expand its existing facilities to house six pandas, as Beijing's gift of two more are arriving next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's time, Pong said, since it would take around two to three years for the cubs to leave Ying Ying and live on their own.

 The Hang Seng Index gained 139.5 points, or 0.8 percent, to open at 17,569.66 points on Monday after hopes for an economic soft landing powered US stocks higher last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Encouraging data relieved recession worries following a brutal sell-off earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 has rebounded more than 6 percent since August 5, when a steep drop pushed the benchmark US index to its biggest three-day slide in over two years. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

 Chinese and Philippine vessels collided on Monday during a confrontation near Xianbin Reef, also known as the Sabina Shoal, in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu said a Philippine coast guard ship ignored repeated warnings from the Chinese side and intentionally sailed towards a Chinese coast guard vessel on maritime enforcement duty, causing the scrape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Philippine side bore full responsibility for the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a regular Foreign Ministry briefing, spokeswoman Mao Ning said the Philippine vessels' actions had seriously violated China's sovereignty, adding China "will continue to take resolute and forceful measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Philippine government said that two of its coast guard ships had been damaged in collisions with Chinese vessels that it said were conducting "unlawful and aggressive manoeuvres". (Agencies)

 Kylian Mbappé was left frustrated on his Real Madrid La Liga debut on Sunday as a resilient Real Mallorca held the Spanish and European champions to a 1-1 draw in their title defence opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French superstar was thwarted by Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif and after Rodrygo Goes sent Madrid ahead early on the hosts levelled in the second half through Vedat Muriqi's towering header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's star-studded side struggled to break down Mallorca, who came closer to winning the game in the final stages at Son Moix stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Los Blancos defender Ferland Mendy was sent off in stoppage time for a high challenge on Muriqi.

  "We went ahead, we had chances to score the second, and then in the second half we lacked balance," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We conceded counter-attacks, it was not a good game, it was quite a clear game to see that we need to defend better and have better balance on the pitch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti selected the same starting line-up which defeated Atalanta to win the Uefa Super Cup on Thursday, with Jude Bellingham in midfield behind the Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo attacking line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé scored in that victory but the former Paris Saint-Germain forward was unable to celebrate his first match in his new homeland with another goal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma won her first women's Tour de France title by just four seconds on Sunday as she dug in during the race's gruelling final Alpine ascent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Canyon SRAM rider summited the daunting Alpe d'Huez mountain one minute one second behind stage winner Demi Vollering to maintain her grip on the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so crazy to be honest, the whole stage was such a crazy rollercoaster," said a visibly emotional Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've gone through such a terrible time on this climb, like I hated everything, then to arriving at the finish line and learning that I won Tour de France, which is insane. It's so mind-blowing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour was turned upside down on Thursday during the fifth stage when Vollering was caught up in a huge crash six kilometres from the finish in Amneville, losing 1min 47sec on the leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After third-placed finishes in the previous two Tours and a disappointing eighth-place finish at the 2024 Olympic Games road race, the victory tasted even sweeter for Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think last year's third place was there to reward me with this victory and same as two weeks ago I was so disappointed getting stuck behind a crash during the Olympics," said the Limanowa-native.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like during this week, all the stars aligned for my team and for myself." (AFP)

    Youngsters hit hard by customer service staff scammers

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are stepping up publicity efforts against fraud after the number of deception cases in Hong Kong went up by 6.2 percent to nearly 20,000 in the first half of the year, incurring losses of HK$4.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But instead of the elderly, the force is now actively reaching out to young people after noticing a demographic shift in victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all fraud cases between January and June, 1,605 involved victims who fell prey to swindlers claiming to be customer service representatives of online platforms such as Taobao and WeChat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That number shot up to 1,111 in July alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-fifth of those victims were aged between 18 and 29, compared with only seven percent who were 70 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's because WeChat Pay and Taobao are commonly used by young persons, and they are the tech-savvy generation," said senior superintendent Tsang Nga-sze of the Commercial Crime Bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the cases, a 50-year-old clerk lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to a swindler posing as a WeChat representative last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was told by the fraudster that he had subscribed to an insurance scheme with an annual fee of HK$70,000, and the plan would be renewed automatically if he didn't complete the cancellation process within that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the scammer's instructions over the phone, he transferred a "guarantee payment" to the swindler, in a bid to verify his identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the process, the scammer sent me some links with bank logos on it, and also [showed me] their staff card, which made me believe that the fraudster was a genuine WeChat representative," the victim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He only realised he had been conned after he was ordered to set up a virtual bank account, apply for a loan and then transfer all the money to a designated account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police warned that September and October are peak months for mainland students to get scammed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, scammers will use the excuse that their visas have some issues because they are involved in some investigations," said superintendent Theodora Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As they are new to Hong Kong, and really want to study or work here... they will believe that they are the true officials from mainland China... and make relevant transfers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force emphasised that the public should ignore calls and messages involving money, or asking for personal details.

    Ernesto restrengthens into Atlantic hurricane

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ernesto restrengthened into a hurricane on Sunday as it travelled well off the shore of eastern United States, threatening wind and rain along the US and Canadian coasts after pummelling Puerto Rico and Bermuda.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hurricane, whose centre is forecast to pass near southeastern Newfoundland, Canada late on Monday into Tuesday, was creating dangerous conditions for residents and vacationers along the North American Atlantic seaboard, the US National Hurricane Center said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beach goers should be aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards," the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ernesto brushed past Puerto Rico earlier in the week leaving more than 600,000 customers without power, then hit Bermuda directly on Saturday, causing more than 70 percent of customers to lose electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Weeks, Bermuda's minister of national security, reported on Sunday that the island "made it through Hurricane Ernesto without any injuries or major incidents," according to The Royal Gazette newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres per hour, Ernesto was a Category 1 storm on the five-level Saffir-Simpson scale as of the NHC's latest advisory at 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) on Sunday, with some increase in speed expected overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swells from Ernesto are affecting parts of the Bahamas, Bermuda, the US East Coast and Atlantic Canada, the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, with the storm located some 520 miles south of Halifax in Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warmer-than-normal Atlantic waters threaten to supercharge this year's hurricane season, scientists have warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on. (AFP)

    Putin arrives in Azerbaijan for state visit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Vladimir Putin is greeted by Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766680_1_20240819043411.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Azerbaijan's capital Baku on Sunday for a two-day state visit, Russian news agencies reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russian television broadcast images of the Russian president's plane as it arrived in Baku in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit to the Caucasus country, a close partner of both Moscow and Turkey but also a major energy supplier to Western countries, comes against the backdrop of an unprecedented Ukrainian military offensive on Russian soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is due to hold talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on bilateral relations and "international and regional problems," the Kremlin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders were dining on Sunday evening at the Azerbaijani president's official residence, local official news agency Asertac said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Aliyev and Putin will sign joint documents and make statements to the press, said Russian agency Ria Novosti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin will also lay a wreath on the tomb of Heydar Aliyev, father of the current leader, who was president from 1993 to 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Kremlin said they would also discuss "the question of settling (the conflict) between Azerbaijan and Armenia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan reconquered the mountainous enclave in September 2023 from the Armenian separatists who had held it for three decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia accused Russia of inadequate support in its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Armenia has sought to deepen its ties with Western countries, especially the United States, much to the annoyance of Moscow, which considers both former Soviet republics to be in its sphere of influence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan is a major producer of natural gas, to whom many European countries turned to make up for the sharp reduction in Russian deliveries after the start of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also hosting the COP29 climate conference in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's last visit to Azerbaijan was in September 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has been under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court since March 2023 for the "deportation" of Ukrainian children to Russia, an accusation the Kremlin denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the threat of arrest has limited Putin's travels abroad, Azerbaijan is not a signatory to the Rome Statute treaty that established the ICC. (AFP)

    Man City beat Chelsea to start title defence

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former Chelsea favourite Mateo Kovacic, (centre), beats Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez at his near post. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766678_1_20240819022912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City got their Premier League title defence off to a winning start as goals from Erling Haaland and Mateo Kovacic inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Enzo Maresca in his first match in charge of Chelsea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haaland marked his 100th appearance for the club with his 91st goal before Kovacic struck on his return to Stamford Bridge to give Pep Guardiola's men the perfect start to their attempt to win a record fifth consecutive English top-flight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were shorn of all four of their Euro 2024 finalists – Rodri, Kyle Waker, John Stones and Phil Foden – from the start as Guardiola opted to give them extra time off to recover from their summer exertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the champions were still able to lay down a marker against one of the few sides they failed to beat in the league last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca has the tough task of moulding a functioning team unit from a bloated Chelsea squad that has 43 players and over 50 on the books including those on loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consequences of those difficult decisions played out even before kick-off as Raheem Sterling's camp released a statement expressing his dismay at being left out of the matchday squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Chilwell was another to face the cull, while Conor Gallagher and Romelu Lukaku are among those not to have been handed squad numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  None of Chelsea's nine summer signings to date were included in Maresca's starting line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even more surprisingly, Enzo Fernandez was named captain despite being embroiled in a race row for a post on social media after Argentina's Copa America victory last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, by contrast, are a model of continuity and consistent excellence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland was one of City's few stars to have had a summer off from international tournaments and took just 18 minutes to make his mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku's low cross was deflected by Bernardo Silva into the Norwegian's path and he coolly dinked over Robert Sanchez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne curled inches wide and Sanchez leapt high to turn over Doku's deflected shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chelsea ended the first half in the ascendency and should have been level before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ederson spilled Cole Palmer's tame shot but was bailed out by Nicolas Jackson's straying needlessly offside before he turned in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden was forced into action earlier than Guardiola would have hoped at half-time as the lively Savinho was forced off injured on his Premier League debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of pre-season minutes for many on show was apparent in the more pedestrian pace than normal for a major Premier League clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea did most of the pressing for an equaliser but offered City chances to extend their lead in doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made a fine save to deny Haaland a second before De Bruyne again fired inches off target when unmarked at the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Chelsea goalkeeper was at fault for the goal that sealed their fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kovacic was allowed to burst through the midfield unchallenged and took aim for the top corner, which he found thanks to a weak hand from Sanchez. (AFP)

    Blinken in Israel as Netanyahu calls Hamas 'obstinate'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Antony Blinken arrives in Tel Aviv for his ninth trip to the Middle East since war broke out in October. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766674_1_20240819005215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's prime minister, under pressure at home and from abroad to reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas, on Sunday accused the militants of obstinance in Gaza truce talks as top US diplomat Antony Blinken landed in Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Making his ninth trip to the Middle East since the Gaza war began when Hamas attacked Israel in October, the US secretary of state is to meet Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders in a renewed bid to seal a deal that could help avert a wider conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken is later set to travel on Tuesday to Cairo, where ceasefire talks will resume in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday reiterated that it is Palestinian Islamist group Hamas that must be pressured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas, up to this moment, remains obstinate. It did not even send a representative to the talks in Doha. Therefore, the pressure should be directed at Hamas and (Yahya) Sinwar, not at the Israeli government," Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting, referring to the Hamas chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order that an agreement be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to his governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Blinken's visit, the foreign ministers of Britain and France were on Friday also in Israel to stress the urgency of a Gaza deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, US President Joe Biden laid out a framework which he said was proposed by Israel. The UN Security Council later endorsed the proposal, which would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks as Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters the besieged Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the truce talks in Doha last Thursday and Friday, Hamas called on mediators to implement the Biden framework rather than holding more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas also announced its opposition to what it called "new conditions" from Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, Netanyahu's office in a statement said Israeli negotiators have expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a Gaza truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have also reported progress and a US official said remaining gaps were "bridgeable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after Biden said "we are closer than we have ever been" to a deal, Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed as "an illusion" such optimistic talk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous announcements that a deal was close during the months of on-off truce negotiations proved unfounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the stakes have risen since the late July killings in quick succession of Iran-backed militant leaders, including Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, and as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, deepened with a feared polio outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli evacuation orders have "reduced the safe zone" in the south of the territory, leaving "no more space" for displaced Palestinians, said Samah Dib, 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people "are sleeping on the street" while clean water is scarce and "there's food at the markets, but it's very expensive and we have no money left," said Dib, who like almost all Gazans is among the displaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As efforts towards a long-sought truce continued, so has the violence in Gaza but also in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war. They did so again on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence rescuers in Hamas-run Gaza reported seven killed in Israeli bombardment of Deir el-Balah and four others in air strikes on the northern Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest killings helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death toll to 40,099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops continued operations in central and southern Gaza and "eliminated" militants in Rafah, on the territory's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the Israeli-designated safe zone in southern Gaza's Al-Mawasi, Lina Saleha, 44, said she could hear "constant artillery shelling" and the rumble of tanks "getting closer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's not a good sign and we're terrified and afraid," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the West Bank, Israel said late on Saturday it had killed "two senior Hamas officials" in Jenin. Hamas's armed wing confirmed the deaths of two militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lebanon, the UN said three peacekeepers were lightly injured in a blast in the country's south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and its regional allies have vowed retaliation for Haniyeh's death in Tehran – which Israel has not claimed responsibility for – and for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees," the US State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club watchdog said that since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces have detained "more than 10,000 Palestinians" in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in 1967.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in the Israeli city of Haifa on Saturday, Guri Lotto, 51, said he was protesting to "put pressure on the government" to secure a hostage release deal and end the war.

  A US official travelling with Blinken said on condition of anonymity that "the feeling is... that various sticking points that existed before are bridgeable, and that work's going to continue."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brentford shrugged off the absence of Ivan Toney to get their Premier League season off to a flying start with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa got the goals for the Bees, who had left out England international Toney over speculation surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toney has less than a year left to run on his contract with the London club and is attracting interest from Saudi clubs after his role in helping England to the Euro 2024 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford boss Thomas Frank said pre-match his side had shown last season they can cope without Toney – who missed much of last term due to a betting ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guehi did captain Crystal Palace despite the interest in him shown by Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England defender had an outstanding Euros but a moment to forget for Brentford's opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbeumo raced onto Wissa's pass and cut inside Guehi before firing into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palace ended last season in sensational form under Oliver Glasner and will feel hard done by not to have earned at least a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eberechi Eze had a brilliantly executed near post free-kick harshly ruled out for a foul by Will Hughes when the score was still level at 0-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bright Palace start to the second half was rewarded when Ethan Pinnock turned Daniel Munoz's header into his own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seconds later, Odsonne Edouard slotted home Eze's pass only to be denied by a marginal offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was Brentford who grabbed the vital third goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dean Henderson could only parry Nathan Collins' shot straight into the path of Wissa, who bundled home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eze was twice denied by Mark Flekken in the closing stages but Brentford held out for an impressive three points. (AFP)

    Ukraine says struck second key bridge in Kursk region

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766668_1_20240818221459.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine said on Sunday it had struck a second key bridge in the Kursk region, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes as Kyiv's unprecedented incursion on Russian soil stretched through its second week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia meanwhile ramped up pressure in east Ukraine, claiming to capture another village just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minus one more bridge," Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram, publishing an aerial video of a blast tearing through a bridge near the Russian town of Zvannoye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precision air strikes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear when Ukraine carried out the attack. Oleshchuk did not give a date and Russian military bloggers shared photos of destruction from what appeared to be the same bridge dated on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6, in its biggest attack on Russian territory since the Kremlin launched its assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Ukraine announced it had destroyed a separate bridge in the neighbouring town of Glushkovo, both of which lie on the river Seym that winds through the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on both bridges have left Russia with limited options to cross the river in the area, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said the destruction of one of the bridges had hindered evacuation efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian defence ministry said in a briefing it was pushing back against Ukraine's forces near several villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 120,000 people have fled the region since fighting began, according to Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia said on Sunday its forces had captured Svyrydonivka, another frontline settlement some 15 kilometres away from Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for the Russian army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of active operations, units of the Centre grouping of troops have liberated the village of Sviridonovka," Moscow's defence ministry said, using the Russian name for the village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian forces have been inching towards Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned earlier this week that Russia was a little over 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian forces earlier on Sunday announced they had thwarted a Russian missile attack on the capital Kyiv where air raid sirens sounded before dawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the third ballistic missile attack on the capital in August with a clear interval of six days between each attack," the Kyiv City Military Administration posted on Telegram after the early morning barrage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No damage or casualties were reported from the attack, which the administration said likely involved "North Korean ballistic missiles of the KN-23 type."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region early on Sunday morning, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos published on social media showed thick black smoke and bursts of flames coming from the site of the blaze, which the governor said was in the town of Proletarsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the southeast of the Rostov region, air defences repelled a drone attack. As a result of falling debris on the territory of industrial storage facilities in Proletarsk, a diesel fuel fire broke out," Governor Vasily Golubev said on Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At 05:35 (0235 GMT), firefighting at the industrial facility in Proletarsk was suspended due to a second drone attack," he added in an update to the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one was injured and firefighting efforts resumed shortly after, he said in a later post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Proletarsk is some 250 kilometres from the Ukraine border and some 350 kilometres from Kyiv-held areas of fighting on the eastern Ukrainian front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, in what it has called "fair" retaliation for attacks on its energy infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of trafficking and manufacturing dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, who claimed to be jobless, was detained as part of a police raid on an industrial unit in Tsuen Wan on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing the press on Sunday, senior inspector Chan Yu-wing from the Narcotics Bureau believed the suspect received instructions remotely from a syndicate on how to manufacture drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers have also confiscated 2kg of suspected ketamine, and 6kg of raw materials, with a total street value of HK$960,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also discovered a large quantity of corrosive substances. In fact, during storage or heating, these chemicals could easily catch fire or explode," Chan warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore, these drug syndicates are completely neglecting public safety. Their actions are extremely irresponsible. If members of the public or security guards in a building smell something suspicious coming from a unit, like a pungent chemical smell, they should contact the police immediately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect will appear before the West Kowloon Magistracy on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has pledged to actively consider a proposal to set up a third medical school in Hong Kong to address the shortage of healthcare professionals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event honouring doctors on Sunday, Lo said the government will bolster the training of local doctors and retain medical personnel in public hospitals to tackle the staffing shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent years, the government has allocated over HK$30 billion to fund the construction of medical training facilities at universities," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, the SAR government will continue to support the two existing medical schools by enhancing their teaching capabilities, boosting admission quotas and sources. The government will also actively consider a proposal to establish a third medical school."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently only the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong offer medical programmes in the SAR, with the schools producing a combined 590 graduates each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Nancy Ip, told the media in February that she hoped to launch the city's third medical school by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She revealed the initial intake of 50 students would be gradually ramped up to 150 per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo also said in the meantime, the government will continue to introduce non-locally trained doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects more than 250 doctors who were trained overseas will have joined the public healthcare system by the end of this year.
