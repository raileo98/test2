<div class="itemFullText">
 A search is continuing on Lantau Island for two stray dogs who were allegedly abused by workers of the Po Lin Monastery last Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police confirmed they have arrested two men, aged 65 and 46, on suspicion of animal abuse yesterday. Both have been granted bail pending an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, who worked as chefs at the Buddhist institution, allegedly removed the canines from the quarters, before setting them free at a remote location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monastery said it has arranged staff to look for the stay dogs near Sham Wat Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement online, it said "the monastery has always been kind to stray dogs around Ngong Ping, providing them a shelter, arranging sterilisation, vaccination and basic medical treatment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprawling monastery on Ngong Ping is home to the Big Buddha, one of the main tourist attractions of Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD on Saturday announced plans to open a car production plant in Pakistan, where it will also start selling three models through a partnership with Mega Motors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BYD is the first major new electric vehicle entrant in the Pakistani market, where there is a lack of charging infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entry into the Pakistani market is not just about bringing advanced vehicles to consumers," said Liu Xueliang, BYD's general manager for Asia Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about driving a broader vision of environmental responsibility and technological innovation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD also plans to open three "flagship stores and experience centres" in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, the company said at a launch event in Lahore, adding it plans to start selling two SUV models and a sedan from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mega Motors is a unit of Pakistan's largest private utility Hub Power Co Ltd, known as Hubco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will establish Pakistan's first NEV assembly plant... dedicated to producing BYD's cutting-edge new energy vehicles," said Hubco Chief Executive Kamran Kamal, who described the deal as a "landmark investment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new plant will begin operations in 2026, Kamal told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hubco will setup fast-charging stations across major cities, motorways and highways to enhance Pakistan's charging infrastructure. (Reuters)

 The Observatory on Sunday cancelled the Amber Rainstorm Warning at 9 am, after it had been in place for about three hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is the second day in a row that the Observatory has issued the amber warning, as Hong Kong continues to be hit by heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government called on members of the public to report any flooding and warned employers, contractors and workers to be aware of electrical safety at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no reports of any incidents.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maria Corina Machado stands on a truck in Caracas to address her supporters. Machado has called for mass gatherings in more than 300 cities in Venezuela and abroad. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766603_1_20240818022148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has mostly been in hiding since July 28 presidential polls, led a "Protest for the Truth" in Caracas on Saturday against Nicolas Maduro's disputed claim of having won reelection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atop an opposition campaign truck, and surrounded by motorcyclists and cars waving the national flag, she joined hundreds of supporters gathered in the capital in response to her call for mass gatherings in more than 300 cities in Venezuela and abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Machado had called for the anti-Maduro movement to "remain firm and united" in the face of threats and violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're trying to scare us, to divide us, to paralyze us, to demoralize us, but they can't because they are absolutely entrenched in their lies (and) violence," she wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many protesters waved printed copies of election records from their voting stations, which they say prove the opposition won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) proclaimed Maduro the winner of a third six-year term until 2031, giving him 52 percent of votes cast on July 28 but without providing a detailed breakdown of the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition says polling-station-level results show its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia took more than two-thirds of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia replaced Machado on the ballot after she was ruled out of running by institutions loyal to the regime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we keep quiet, this makes no sense," said demonstrator Adriana Calzadilla, a 55-year-old teacher in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a criminal government that wants to hold on to power. I smell freedom, I have nothing to fear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-Maduro protests have claimed 25 lives so far, with nearly 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested since election day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early on Saturday, a heavy security presence took shape in the capital, with two armoured vehicles and 40 motorcycle-mounted troops controlling access to the low-income Petare neighborhood, a few miles from the opposition's gathering point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media reported similar deployments in other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one of the first overseas demonstrations to get under way Saturday, more than 100 Venezuelans in Australia rallied in Sydney, waving national flags and balloons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a strong message to our people in Venezuela. We are with you, and we want the world to listen what we are saying," said protest organizer Rina Rivas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear if Gonzalez Urrutia, also in hiding, will attend Saturday's march. He last appeared in public at a protest on July 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro had called for Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia to be arrested. He accuses them of seeking to foment a "coup d'etat." (AFP)

    Liverpool brush aside Ipswich, Arsenal beat Wolves

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Liverpool manager Arne Slot and first team individual development coach Aaron Briggs watch the game. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766596_1_20240817223239.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot got off to a winning start as Liverpool manager with a 2-0 win at newly-promoted Ipswich on Saturday as Arsenal began their Premier League title challenge by beating Wolves by the same scoreline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newcastle defied an early red card for Fabian Schar to edge past Southampton 1-0, while Brighton ran riot under new manager Fabian Hurzeler in a 3-0 victory at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot has huge shoes to fill at Anfield after the departure of Jurgen Klopp, who restored the Reds to the top of the English game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman was left less than impressed by his side's first 45 minutes at Portman Road as Ipswich flew out of the traps on their return to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Liverpool were a different side after the break as goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah barely reflected their dominance to get Slot off to the perfect start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We as a team made a big change at half-time because we came out totally different to how we had come out in the first half," said the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second half, we won more duels, we won more second balls and we played more balls in behind because if the other team takes the risk of playing one-v-one and you have the likes of Luis Diaz, Mo Salah and Diogo Jota then use them, play the balls in behind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have finished second to Manchester City in each of the past two seasons and are highly-fancied to be the champions' closest challengers again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kai Havertz opened the scoring at the Emirates from Bukayo Saka's cross to reward the Gunners' early dominance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men needed a vital save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen and Matheus Cunha missed a huge chance to level before Arsenal made the points safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The roles from the first goal were reversed as this time Havertz teed up Saka to lash home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's hopes of a winning start to the season looked to have been undone when Schar was sent off after just 28 minutes for what the referee deemed a headbutt on Ben Brereton Diaz despite limited contact between the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton had dominated even the early exchanges against the Magpies' full compliment but failed to convert from 19 shots and nearly 80 percent possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Newcastle were clinical as Alexander Isak teed up Joelinton for the only goal just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's final season at Goodison Park got off to a nightmare start as 31-year-old Hurzeler enjoyed a dream start to life in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaoru Mitoma fired Brighton in front on his return from injury that saw the Japanese international miss much of last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Welbeck added a second after the break before Everton were reduced to 10 men when Ashley Young saw red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Adingra made it 3-0 late on and only a VAR review denied Brighton a fourth through Yasin Ayari.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Semenyo stepped into the void left at Bournemouth by the departure of Dominic Solanke with a late equaliser to salvage a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City begin their defence of the title in the standout fixture of the weekend at Chelsea on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester United got their campaign off to a winning start on Friday when debutant Joshua Zirkzee came off the bench to grab a late winner in a 1-0 victory over Fulham. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Infectious diseases expert Professor Ivan Hung says the chances of the mpox virus spreading to Hong Kong is very low. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766586_1_20240817180654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Saturday were told not to panic about the more deadly and transmissible clade 1b strain of the mpox virus, but those belonging to the high-risk groups, should stay vigilant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advice from infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung came after the World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency - the highest level of alarm that can be issued by the world body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox were reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in a single week, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit country, the Democratic Republic of Congo has reported 222 confirmed and 783 suspected cases, as well as 24 deaths in one week, the African union health agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Hung told RTHK that the chance of the virus spreading to the SAR was very low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he urged those belonging to high-risk groups - such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, bisexuals, and laboratory workers - to get vaccinated and watch out for symptoms. They include a rash, a fever, coughing, and a stuffy nose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But important, of course, is that you have to take extra precaution if you belong to the high-risk groups and also those who are immunocompromised, then of course you should be cautious and consider taking the vaccines,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong professor also urged people to avoid travelling to high-risk areas in Africa, and not to touch wild animals so as to reduce the risk of catching the viral disease. (with additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand thumped Argentina 42-10 on Saturday as Will Jordan grabbed two of their six tries in The Rugby Championship to avenge last week's shock defeat by the Pumas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Damian McKenzie scored 17 points in Auckland as the All Blacks defied wet conditions in a skilled attacking display to maintain their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was vast improvement on the 38-30 loss in Wellington last week, with an explosive first-half performance pushing the hosts 35-3 ahead through five converted tries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was built on a dominant display from the forwards, who heeded the call for "redemption" issued to them by coach Scott Robertson after they were outplayed a week earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina's scrum was overpowered and they weren't the same force at the breakdown in a performance punctuated by mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their lone try came late in the match to fullback Juan Cruz Mallia, meaning the second half was drawn 7-7, helped by tighter defence from the visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was New Zealand's best performance under first-year coach Robertson in his fifth match in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory continued New Zealand's remarkable record in Auckland, where they've won 50 Tests since their last defeat, against France in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed all his six conversion attempts and his general play was superior to the first Test, mixing an astute long kicking game with some clever chips to counter the Pumas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The playmaker also opened the scoring with a try after pouncing on a chip from Jordie Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santiago Carreras responded with a Pumas penalty goal before New Zealand captain Ardie Savea powered over for his 27th Test try -- lifting him level with former skipper Richie McCaw for the most by an All Blacks forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Caleb Clarke and Jordan were both put into space for tries -- the latter capitalising on a blindside break from scrum-half TJ Perenara.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie's sweetly timed pass put Beauden Barrett across just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan continued the rout soon after the break, lifting him to 33 tries in as many Tests in his first starting appearance since last year's World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game entered a lull before Mallia's try and a late yellow card was shown to All Blacks hooker Asafo Aumua for a high tackle. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tobacco and Control Office on Saturday said it launched a crackdown on the smoking of waterpipes, also known as shishas or hookahs, in Tsim Sha Tui on Friday night, issuing 11 fixed penalty notices at one bar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers including those in plain clothes raided the bar, handing out the notices which carry a penalty of HK$1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also said the bar's operators may be prosecuted under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance, and for aiding and abetting smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tobacco and Control Office spokesman said due to deeper inhalation a waterpipe smoker usually inhales more toxins and that a typical one-hour session exposes the user to 100-to-200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also flagged the carbon monoxide poisoning risk of charcoal burning and the unhygienic smoking apparatus

<div class="itemFullText">
 A typhoon that blasted parts of Japan with more than 200-kilometre-per-hour winds moved out to sea on Saturday, mostly sparing the capital and allowing trains and some flights to resume.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tokyo and its surrounding areas had been on high alert on Friday for Ampil's approach, with transport services, trips, events and school classes cancelled en masse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm was packing gusts of 216 kilometres per hour on Saturday morning when it veered away from the archipelago and headed northeast into the Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, the Japan Meteorological Agency warned that "some areas in the northern part of Japan are experiencing heavy rain due to warm, humid air around the typhoon".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please be advised that the risk of landslides has been significantly elevated by the heavy rain so far in some areas", the weather agency said in an advisory on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although a severe hit on Tokyo never came, some minor injuries and damage were reported, including broken windows, toppled trees and broken utility poles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most parts of Japan's bullet train network went back to normal on Saturday after the Central Japan Railway Company closed a busy section between Tokyo and Nagoya the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "JR Central bullet trains are business as usual today," the railway firm said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airlines were still being affected to a degree, with broadcaster NHK saying All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines had together scrapped 68 flights as of Saturday morning, after hundreds of cancellations the day before. (AFP)

    Sports Institute head defends athlete sponsorship

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) chief executive Tony Choi says the institute provides the city's athletes with an overall package, which includes some financial sponsorship, but athletes are not its employees.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments come after Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary general of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, said local athletes didn't have a need to spend much as they were allocated with accommodation, training, and medical support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But online criticism continued following the SAR's success at the Paris Olympics, with athletes chiming in and saying they had to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Choi said entry-level full-time athletes get around HK$7,000 a month, so they could focus on training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSI and the athlete are not employer and employee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But also we are including overseas training, local training, coaching support, accommodation, meals, and also education support. It's an overall package for the elite athletes... They are not our staff."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi denied that the limited subsidy provided had led to potential athletes dropping out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see many athletes dropping out... We tried our best to help, in terms of other expenses, which included study, career planning. We hope to give athletes motivation... If many potential athletes dropped out, Hong Kong wouldn't have achieved good results," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi added that "only the fittest will survive", and resources given to athletes were inevitably hinged on their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-chairman of the HKSI, Vincent Cheng, said a review on a direct subsidy scheme for local athletes will be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have to review every four years. We're going to have this review starting from September and October, and hopefully we can finish it earlier next year. We will review... especially on their subsidy support," he said.

    Heavy rain hits Hong Kong as drainage contracts signed

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong saw heavy rain on Saturday morning with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning for about five-and-a-half hours until just before 11 am. There were no reports of any damage, although there was some flooding in Ma On Shan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government put out a call for the public to report any flooding and for employers, contractors, and employees to be aware of electrical safety at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rainfall comes less than a day after the Drainage Services Department outlined seven projects to cope with the increasingly frequent extreme weather conditions, with the Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok signing five contracts relating to the projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new projects follow the extreme rainstorms last September and a commitment to implement them by the Chief Executive John Lee in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include six underground flood storage tanks in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City, Shek Kip Mei, Sha Tin, Tai Po, and Kwun Tong along with drainage improvement works in those districts and in Eastern District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage tanks, which have a total capacity of more than 200,000 cubic metres, will be at Shek Kip Mei Park, Morse Park, Hoi Bun Road Park, Argyle Street Playground, Tai Po Old Market Playground, and Sha Tin Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work will be completed in phases over the next three-and-a-half years to six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five contracts signed on Friday totalled HK$6.4 billion.

    Manchester United see off Fulham after shaky start

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joshua Zirkzee made himself a Manchester United hero on his debut with a late winner to beat Fulham 1-0 in the opening match of the Premier League season on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, lacking match fitness after his move from Bologna last month, came on only for the final half hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch international saved the Red Devils from a frustrating evening at Old Trafford when he poked in Alejandro Garnacho's cross on 87 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better," said Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been told (scoring at the Stretford End) is one of the best feelings at Manchester United. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United boss Erik ten Hag survived at the end of last season, despite finishing eighth in the Premier League, thanks to winning the FA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether that shock victory over rivals and English champions Manchester City in May could be a springboard remains to be seen after a performance that was eerily reminiscent of many last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said on the eve of the game that his side were "not ready" for the new campaign with key players missing through injury or a lack of match fitness, and it showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Fernandes started in a centre-forward role in the absence of Rasmus Hojlund, while Zirkzee was on the bench after returning to pre-season late following Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noussair Mazraoui was thrown straight into the starting line-up at left-back after joining from Bayern Munich this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was no place in the squad for Jadon Sancho even though the winger and Ten Hag appeared to have settled their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fulham won at Old Trafford last season for the first time in 20 years in February during a torrid campaign for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little seemed to have changed in the opening 20 minutes as the visitors started confidently and Andre Onana did well to prevent Kenny Tete's dipping effort finding the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fulham were nearly masters of their own downfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro pounced on Bernd Leno's sloppy pass and teed up Fernandes, who could only fire straight at Fulham's German goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro's struggles played a large part in United's problems last season, but the Brazilian started the new campaign more like his old self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An incisive through ball from the former Real Madrid midfielder created another brilliant chance for Fernandes, who again could not beat Leno from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's lack of a predatory striker continued to haunt them after the break as Leno spread himself brilliantly to this time deny Mason Mount a rare goal since his move from Chelsea just over a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag turned to Garnacho and Zirkzee from the bench in the search of a winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In doing so United left themselves open and Fulham could have secured another famous three points at the Theatre of Dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreas Pereira's poor pass cost Alex Iwobi the chance to run clean through on goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later Lisandro Martinez produced a goal-saving clearance from Pereira's dangerous low cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was the home side that snatched all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho's ball from the right was not the best, but Zirkzee managed to get a toe on it to divert it beyond Leno into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United should have had a second in stoppage time when Garnacho somehow skewed wide with an open goal to aim at from Marcus Rashford's unselfish pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But United held on to give Ten Hag the winning start he badly needed. (AFP)

    Harris woos middle classes with economic package

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, has promised to champion an "opportunity economy," and build up the middle class. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766526_1_20240817044608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris unveiled an economic blueprint on Friday heavy on popular measures to cut costs for Americans, while attacking powerful companies for price gouging, as she fleshed out her election platform ahead of the Democratic National Convention.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The speech in North Carolina -- a vital battleground state -- was the first time Harris, who jumped into the race against Donald Trump less than a month ago, laid out a vision for combating the inflation which soured voters on her boss President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promising to champion an "opportunity economy," she said "building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an effort to connect with voters angry at Biden, Harris recounted her modest background, noting that she'd worked in a McDonald's during university studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And she acknowledged that while "by any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world..., many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking a leaf from Trump's populist playbook, she threw out the idea of hefty tax breaks for families with children, help in accessing government-subsidized health care, and support for first-time homebuyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This came on top of an announcement Thursday that the White House has negotiated reduced prices for retirees purchasing common medicines from major drug manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also called on Congress to pass a first federal ban on so-called "price-gouging" by food companies that unfairly increase prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the convention starting in Chicago on Monday, the proposals were meant to flesh out a come-from-behind campaign that has seen Harris spark huge enthusiasm in the Democratic Party, but offer little detail on how she'd govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice president, vying to become the first woman president, hopes the headline-grabbing proposals will distance her from Biden's unpopular management of price surges that hit ordinary Americans in the wake of the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump and the Republicans are trying to tie Harris to 81-year-old Biden, who abruptly dropped his re-election bid on July 21 and endorsed his vice president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kamala Harris has had three-and-a-half years in office and all she's done is break the economy. Kamala can't shake the stench of Bidenomics," the Trump campaign said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trump campaign referred to an "inflation nightmare for American families" and claimed "Harris's vision is a Soviet-style communism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In reality, inflation is on a steady downward trend, while the US economy has avoided a much-feared recession, with strong job growth and record stock markets. However, the lingering effects from the Covid-related upheaval continue to be felt for regular consumers, ranging from prices on some food items to high interest rates for home buyers.

  <br/>
  What's not yet clear is how the generous Harris tax breaks would be paid for. The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that Harris's measures would cost more than US$1.7 trillion over the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, has mirrored some of Trump's populist strategy, including a proposal to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Harris is drawing a contrast with 78-year-old Trump's economic vision, painting him as being pro-millionaires and risking sharply increased costs for Americans through his proposal to slap tariffs of 10-20 percent on global imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations... I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans," Harris said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off an early slump to close higher on Friday, ending a positive week for the major indices on Wall Street, as gold prices hit a record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We had very big moves over the past two weeks, off the low," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments. "And now we are only five percent below the all time high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That shows us that there is still a lot of demand for stocks at lower prices," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.2 percent at 40,659.76, the S&P 500 finished 0.2 percent higher at 5,554.25 and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.2 percent higher at 17,631.72.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold hit a new record on Friday as investors snapped up the precious metal amid increasing confidence that US rates will fall in September, weakening the US dollar. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also increased market appetite for safe haven investments like gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders are now looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes of its most recent interest rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also be closely scrutinizing comments from Fed officials around the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers next weekend, according to Sarhan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have expectations that the Fed is going to cut, the question now becomes how many times they will cut," he said. "Nobody knows, not even the Fed. It's data dependent once again." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kyiv said on Friday its incursion into Russian territory had advanced, claiming it aimed to force Russia to negotiate on "fair" terms, as Moscow's troops announced new gains in eastern Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv's troops last week launched a major counter-offensive into Russia's Kursk region, sending more than 120,000 people fleeing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the Ukrainian military Oleksandr Syrsky told President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday that "the troops continue to fight and have advanced in some areas from one to three kilometres (0.6 to 1.8 miles) towards the enemy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said in his evening address: "We see that the occupier is suffering losses, and this is useful, very useful for our defence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky's aide Mykhailo Podolyak said earlier Friday that Ukraine wanted to negotiate "on our own terms" by inflicting "significant tactical defeats on Russia".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have absolutely no plans to beg: 'Please, sit down to negotiate', he wrote on X, saying that Kyiv in the Kursk region is using military means to "persuade Russia to enter a fair negotiation process".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Vladimir Putin has said Russia would declare a ceasefire only if Kyiv withdraws from the four regions that Russia claims to have annexed but only partially controls -- Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine meanwhile claims to have seized more than 1,100 square kilometres of Russian territory, in the biggest attack by a foreign army on Russian soil since World War II. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gold hit a record high on Friday as global stock markets diverged, with profit-taking on Wall Street while European and Asian markets gained on reassuring data about the health of the world's biggest economy and likely US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Expectations of US interest rate cuts weakened the dollar, while oil prices tumbled as weak Chinese demand expectations offset turmoil in the Middle East, according to traders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold rose to a record high of US$2,500.16 an ounce as investors snapped up the haven investment in the face of an increasingly likely US interest rate cut in September and heightened geopolitical risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sharp drop in bond yields amid expectations of rate cuts by the Fed" have pushed gold prices higher, said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's major indices dipped at the start of trading after rallying on Thursday following stronger-than-expected retail sales data that dispelled fears the US economy is heading for a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These aren't big moves at all relative to the gains that have preceded them, yet buyers aren't rushing in to buy the dip just yet knowing the market has come a long way in a short amount of time," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the S&P 500 is up more than eight percent from its August 5 low and the Nasdaq Composite has gained 12 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices slumped more than 1.5 percent, Brent North Sea crude falling under US$80 per barrel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The significant price recovery on the oil market has run out of steam in recent days," said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For one thing, the feared retaliatory strike by Iran (on Israel) has so far failed to materialise, which has probably favoured a partial pricing out of the risk premium. In addition, new demand concerns are weighing on the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major oil producer Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for last month's killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. (AFP)

    We will ensure panda cubs' survival: Ocean Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Friday said it is sparing no effort to ensure the survival of the newborn giant panda twins in Hong Kong, with experts keeping a watchful eye on the cubs around the clock.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing a day after their birth, the park reassured that the twins' survival rate is higher in captivity, compared to those born in the wild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Howard Chuk, the head of Zoological Operations and Conservation at Ocean Park, noted that experts from the mainland are also playing a role in ensuring the baby pandas’ survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the cubs are actually being handled by the experts from Wolong [National Nature Reserve]. We make sure the cubs could [reach] a more stable status," he said, adding that they hope the mother panda, Ying Ying, can raise them later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, we do hope that Ying Ying can learn it and experience it, and not jeopardise her welfare management."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying gave birth to the twins on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Ocean Park's chairman, Paulo Pong, confirmed that the new cubs will stay in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Luckily at the same time we're actually receiving two new pandas. So it's perhaps the double gold from the Olympics, perhaps it's the double bronze from the Olympics that gave us even more luck," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope this will bring great fortune to Hong Kong and we hope to continue our journey in our works of conservation and education," Pong added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Friday said he expects the public could meet the two new giant pandas gifted by the central authorities in December.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Yeung visited Sichuan where he attended a cooperation agreement signing ceremony on the arrival arrangements for the two giant pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up his visit, he said the two giant pandas are expected to arrive in the SAR by late September. But he said the pair would have to undergo one month of quarantine and that they would need another month to adapt to their new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that Ocean Park may need new facilities to accommodate giant pandas, as the city's panda Ying Ying gave birth to two cubs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, in the future, may have six giant pandas... Newborn giant panda babies can live in the same environment with their mum until they are two to three years old," he told reporters at the airport here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still have time. In the next one or two years, we can plan for long-term arrangements regarding the living environment of the six giant pandas."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the two newborn giant pandas are currently in a stable condition, and that the twins would continue to stay in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Newborn giant pandas need special care because of their small size, such as in terms of their body temperature or how they take in milk," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But people don't have to worry about that. Experts from the mainland and Ocean Park are closely monitoring their situation. We are providing the most professional and the best care for the cubs."

    Job market remains stable for fifth straight month

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's labour market remains stable, with the unemployment rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive month. File photo: Xinhua" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766471_1_20240816172116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's job market remained steady, with the latest government data showing the unemployment rate at three percent between May and July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure has been unchanged since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a government spokesperson warned the labour market could be under pressure in the short term, as changing spending habits of locals and visitors would dent consumption-related industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the jobless rate remained consistent, around 3,100 people still lost their jobs in July, joining more than 114,000 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, the labour force expanded by 8,400 to roughly 3.83 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weak domestic demand continued to weigh on consumption-related industries. The jobless rate for the retail sector worsened by 0.4 percent to 4.3 percent, while food and beverage industry hit five percent after going up three-tenths of a percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other sectors improved, notably trade and wholesale, accommodation services, transportation, insurance sector and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market "should remain tight in the near term", according to labour and welfare minister Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Statistics from the Labour Department suggest job hunters have much less choice. There were around 71,700 private-sector vacancies in July, a 31 percent decline from a year ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the three-month period ending in June, according to revised figures released by the government on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth followed a 2.8 percent increase in GDP in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, government economist Adolph Leung said he expects the economy to continue to expand, driven by strong export demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year. Exports of goods should sustain a positive performance if external demand holds up, though trade conflicts would present risks,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials kept this year's projected economic growth unchanged at 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It downgraded the projected inflation rate from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent for the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China supports a plan by Myanmar's military government to hold fresh elections and return the country to a "democratic transition".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Thailand to attend a regional meeting, Wang said that China also supports a peace plan agreed to by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), known as its five-point "consensus".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We support Myanmar in achieving domestic political reconciliation within the framework of its constitution... and restarting the process of democratic transition through elections," the foreign minister said at the meeting in Chiang Mai.

  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country has been in turmoil ever since the military deposed the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coup upended a 10-year experiment with democracy and a subsequent military crackdown has sparked fighting with established ethnic minority armed groups and newer pro-democracy "People's Defence Forces".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is an ally of the military government, but analysts say it also maintains ties with ethnic groups fighting the military in Myanmar's northern Shan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar's government has promised to hold fresh elections but has repeatedly delayed a timetable for polls as it struggles to crush opposition to its coup across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week Wang met military chief Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw and "discussed and exchanged views openly regarding free and fair multi-party general elections".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar is deeply divided by conflict, with civilians caught up in near-daily bomb blasts, targeted killings and clashes between the military and opponents of its coup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has acknowledged it does not fully control swathes of the country and in February activated a long-dormant conscription law to replenish its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has said it will hold polls next year after conducting a nationwide census. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

    Thaksin's daughter becomes new Thai PM

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paetongtarn Shinawatra won the backing of parliament to become Thailand's youngest prime minister on Friday, only a day after she was thrust into the spotlight amid an unrelenting power struggle between the warring elites.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old daughter of divisive political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra won easily with 319 votes, or nearly two-thirds of the house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was not present in parliament and watched the vote from her Pheu Thai Party's headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn now faces a baptism of fire, just two days after ally Srettha Thavisin was dismissed as premier by a judiciary central to Thailand's two decades of intermittent turmoil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At stake could be the legacy and political future of the billionaire Shinawatra family, whose once unstoppable populist juggernaut suffered its first election defeat in over two decades last year, and had to do a deal with its bitter enemies in the military to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn will immediately face challenges on multiple fronts, with the economy floundering and the popularity of her Pheu Thai Party dwindling, having yet to deliver on its flagship cash handout programme worth 500 billion baht.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn has never served in government and will become Thailand's second female prime minister and the third Shinawatra to take the top job after aunt Yingluck Shinawatra, and 75-year-old father Thaksin, the country's most influential and polarising politician. (Reuters)

    China to screen arrivals for mpox symptoms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China announced on Friday it would begin screening people and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, just two days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global health emergency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People travelling from countries where virus outbreaks have occurred, who have been in contact with mpox cases or display symptoms, should "take the initiative to declare to customs when entering the country", China's customs administration said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vehicles, containers and items from areas with mpox cases should also be sanitised, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden on Thursday announced the first case outside Africa of a more dangerous variant of mpox, with the WHO warning that further imported cases of this new strain in Europe was likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO on Wednesday had sounded its highest possible alarm over the worsening mpox situation in Africa, calling it a global public health emergency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just a day before, the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the intensifying outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox has swept through the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970, and spread to other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals, but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions. (AFP)

    'Raygun' hits back at critics of her Olympic routine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael Gunn said the backlash to her much-ridiculed Olympic performance has been “devastating,” adding she took the competition seriously and gave her best effort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old b-girl, known as "Raygun", said in a video posted to social media that she wasn’t prepared for the level of negative attention she has received since judges awarded her zero points in her Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) criticised an anonymous online petition attacking the Paris Games competitor, saying it was “vexatious, misleading and bullying.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympic debut in Paris, and one of the lasting images was the performance of Gunn, a 36-year-old university professor from Sydney — who did a “kangaroo dance” among other questionable moves during her routine — and did not receive a single point from any of the nine judges in either round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn was subsequently mocked for her efforts, including a parody on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in the United States. In the video, she said she was subjected to abuse that went beyond criticism of her dance moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’d really like to ask the press to please stop harassing my family, my friends, the Australian breaking community and the broader street dance community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn, who has not yet returned to Australia, received strong support from Australian Olympic team leader Anna Meares while in Paris. On Thursday, the AOC went a step further, taking aim at what it called erroneous material published online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief executive officer Matt Carroll said the the AOC had written to Change.org, which had published a petition criticising Gunn and the AOC, demanding that it be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 people had signed the petition claiming Gunn had “manipulated” Olympic qualification processes. The petition appeared to have been removed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carroll said the petition “contained numerous falsehoods designed to engender hatred against an athlete who was selected in the Australian Olympic team through a transparent and independent qualification event and nomination process.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking at the Olympics might have been one-and-done in Paris. The sport is not on the competition list for Los Angeles in 2028, and also is unlikely to appear in 2032 at Brisbane, Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online criticism of Gunn this past week has included suggestions the Oceania qualifying event held in Sydney last October was set up to favour her, and questioned the judging that allowed Gunn to qualify .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AOC said Thursday the Oceania qualifying event was conducted under the Olympic qualification system determined by the international governing body, the World DanceSport Federation, and approved by International Olympic Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unattributed social media comments also suggested Gunn and her husband, fellow breaker Samuel Free, had held positions within Australian breaking organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Rachael Gunn holds no position with AUSBreaking or DanceSport Australia in any capacity,” the AOC said Thursday. “She is simply an athlete who competed in the qualifying event which she won.” (AP)

 Immigration officials on Friday said they had arrested three people on suspicion of working illegally in the SAR as photographers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department said it believes the trio – a man and two women – had advertised wedding and street photography services on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they pretended to be customers and arrested the three suspects after they entered Hong Kong from the mainland as tourists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea broke a century-old weather record with the 26th so-called tropical night in a row -- when the temperature stays above 25 degrees Celsius, according to official data released Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Much of the world is enduring a summer of extreme heat, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning last month of an "extreme heat epidemic", and calling for action to limit the impact of heatwaves intensified by climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight temperatures in the South Korean capital Seoul have sizzled above 25 degrees Celsius for 26 days in a row, officials said, marking the longest streak since modern weather observation began in 1907.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record ties a streak set in 2018, but the weather agency counts the most recent as the benchmark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The intense heat in Seoul is expected to continue, according to Seoul's Office of Metrology, setting a new record every day until next week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck 34 kilometres off Taiwan's eastern city of Hualien on Friday, with no immediate reports of damage from what was the second strong tremor to hit the island in less than a day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The quake also shook buildings in Taipei. Authorities said subway services in the city continued at lower speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quake had a depth of 9.7 kilometres, the weather administration said, and followed a 5.7 magnitude earthquake that struck off Taiwan's northeastern shore on late Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather officials have warned of the risk of landslides in mountainous areas following days of rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, Hualien was hit by the biggest earthquake to affect the island in at least 25 years. Nine people were killed and more than 900 injured. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB's Kennedy Wong said if Hong Kong didn't lower or scrap hard liquor duty, it would lose out to Hainan Island and Macau. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766395_1_20240816093031.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong says Hong Kong should scrap its 100 percent levy on strong alcohol so it can match the wine industry and become an international trading centre for hard liquor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Wong said the wine trade had boomed since duty was scrapped in 2008 and revenue from sales of alcohol with a strength of over 30 percent was only HK$700 million. He also said Hong Kong needs to compete with Hainan, which will be tax free by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look at this issue from a trade perspective. If we don't lower or scrap the duty we are already losing out to Macau and the surrounding areas and at the end of this year, when Hainan turns into a free trade zone, a lot of the whisky, brandy promotions - because they are all aimed at the mainland China market - they'll all move to Hainan. Hard liquor from mainland China, like the Moutai, the Wuliangyee, they won't use Hong Kong to tap the international market, they might as well use Hainan," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong had the highest liquor duty in the region with Macau only charging 10 percent. He said Hong Kong also charged more than Taiwan and Japan, although the duty here was about the same as South Korea. He said Hainan, which caters mainly to the mainland domestic tourist market, had been declared a tax free area by the State Council in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said if Hong Kong followed the same route as the wine trade here, it could be an attractive place for companies wanting to sell top-of-the range hard liquor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You scrapped the duty so a lot of aged or vintage wine moved to Hong Kong and because Hong Kong also had first-class storage facilities - and because of our close proximity to the mainland China market, which is a big, big market you know for the wine industry - a lot of wine merchants created off-shoots here including a lot of French vineyards, chateaux that I know," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think likewise for liquor: for vodka, for whisky, for brandy, for the Moutai and so on. If they all create more trading companies here and then they are willing to move some of their vintage - the nice liquor - to Hong Kong, then Hong Kong will gradually climb back to the top of the world in this particular field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month the DAB called on the Chief Executive John Lee to scrap the duty on hard liquor as part of its proposals for Lee's upcoming policy address.

 Hungary's Blanka Vas won the fifth stage of the Tour de France Femmes on Thursday with Dutch teammate Demi Vollering losing the race lead after being caught up in a big crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma finished second to take the leader's yellow jersey from defending champion Vollering who dropped to ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pile-up with six kilometres to go involving 10 riders including Vollering decimated the peloton in the run to Amneville in northeastern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Team SD Worx leader now trails 1min 19sec behind her main rival Niewiadoma, who had started the stage 34 seconds behind Vollering. (AFP)

    Pochettino to become new US national team coach

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly agreed terms to become the new coach of the United States national team, according to multiple reports on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Athletic and ESPN reported that unnamed sources confirmed Pochettino, who parted ways with English Premier League side Chelsea in May, would replace Gregg Berhalter as boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino, 52, would arrive as the United States prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino left Chelsea after finishing sixth in the Premier League in his only season in charge, after previous stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports said the deal was struck after multiple conversations with US Soccer Federation technical director Matt Crocker, and that no contract has been signed nor has the federation's board of directors agreed a deal with Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentinian cannot sign a contract with US Soccer until a pay situation with Chelsea is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino would be expected to take over the US squad in time for a friendly against Canada on September 7 at Kansas City. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-ranked defending champion Coco Gauff crashed out in her opening match at the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Open, falling to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The second-round shock to America's Paris Olympic flag-bearer stunned a partisan crowd in the US heartland in the final major tuneup for the US Open on August 26, where Gauff is defending champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva, ranked 34th, has made a recent habit of upsets, knocking off world number one Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon third round barely a month ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really proud of myself," said Putintseva. "Even if the crowd was cheering for Coco, they were fair with me. "These courts are so fast, you have to just play on instinct. That's what I did."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff became the youngest winner at Cincinnati a year ago at age 19 and carried that success into her first Grand Slam triumph at the US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva will next face Spain's Paula Badosa, who defeated Anna Kalinsyaka 6-3, 6-2. (AFP)

    Strong retail figures send Wall Street higher

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766373_1_20240816051338.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 2 percent after July US retail sales data signaled resilient consumer spending, allaying fears of an imminent recession in the world's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Retail sales increased 1.0 percent after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent drop in June, easing fears of a sharp economic slowdown fanned by a jump in the unemployment rate last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail bellwether Walmart rose 6.58 percent after raising its annual profit forecast for the second time this year as Americans flocked to its stores for inexpensive essentials. Rivals Target and Costco also advanced 4.35 percent and 1.69 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate reading also showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wall of worry is beginning to crumble as sentiment is improving and the fundamentals support a risk-on bias," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. "Retail sales were above expectations, Consumer Price Index numbers came in at a tolerable level, so the fundamental backdrop is consistent with rising equity prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors have cautiously eyed this week's economic data releases, the last set before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivers a much-awaited speech at Jackson Hole next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39 percent, to 40,563. The S&P 500 gained 1.61 percent, at 5,543. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.34 percent, to 17,595.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other movers, Cisco Systems rose 6.8 percent after it forecast better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and said it was cutting 7 percent of its global workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike climbed 5.07 percent as billionaire investor William Ackman built new stakes in the sportswear company. Ulta Beauty jumped 11.17 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a stake in the cosmetics store chain. (Reuters)

    Biden says he "beat Big Pharma" with drug price deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has negotiated down the prices of 10 top-selling prescription drugs used by Medicare by as much as 79 percent, hoping to save US$6 billion in the first year as part of a plan hailed on Thursday by President Joe Biden with the aim to ease anger about high prices ahead of November elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, was the first to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most costly drugs that the programme covers for 66 million people. The new prices will go into effect in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We finally beat Big Pharma," Biden said at an event in Largo, Maryland, alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration hopes the savings will ease Americans' anger about high prices, an issue they frequently say is their top concern headed into the closely contested November 5 presidential election between Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs," Harris said. "Medicare can use that (collective bargaining) power to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new prices represent cuts to individual list prices that do not reflect any rebates and discounts the government may already be getting for the drugs, although the government's estimated savings from the negotiations do take those discounts into account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' tie-breaking Senate vote passed the law that allows for the drug-price negotiations, which no Republicans supported. In a statement, she also pointed to her work as California attorney general holding "big pharma accountable for their deceptive and illegal practices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said people covered by Medicare, which mostly serves Americans aged 65 and over, would also save US$1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs for the prescription medicines in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merck & Co's diabetes drug Januvia faces the steepest percentage price cut of the drugs on the list, decreasing 79 percent, while Novo Nordisk's insulin aspart products will face the second steepest of 76 percent, according to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other eight drugs on the list face cuts of between 68 percent and 38 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drugmakers voiced their opposition to the new discounts that they said would not necessarily lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and could hinder future innovation. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden confirmed its first case of the viral infection mpox on Thursday, which was also the first case outside Africa, a day after the WHO declared the disease a global public health emergency for the second time in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The person was infected while staying in a part of Africa where there was a large outbreak of the disease, Olivia Wigzell, director-general at the Swedish Public Health Agency, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation made its announcement over mpox, which spreads through close contact, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries of a more serious type of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I," Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed told the press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigzell said the person who was infected had received care and instructions in line with the health agency's recommendations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The case is the first caused by Clade I that has been diagnosed outside the African continent. The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade I," she said. (Reuters)

    Five charged over death of 'Friends' actor Perry

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766362_2_20240816012519.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Criminal charges have been filed against five people in connection with the death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry nearly a year ago, law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defendants include two doctors and an assistant to Perry who were part of "a broad underground criminal network" that distributed large quantities of the prescription drug ketamine to the actor and others, US Attorney Martin Estrada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These defendants took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves," Estrada said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry died at age 54 from "acute effects" of ketamine, a powerful sedative, in addition to other factors that caused the actor to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub last October, an autopsy said. For months, Los Angeles homicide detectives and federal agents have been investigating how Perry obtained the prescription drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A December 2023 autopsy report concluded Perry died from the "acute effects of ketamine," which combined with other factors caused the actor to lose consciousness and slip below the water in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toxicology tests found Perry's body contained dangerously high levels of ketamine, a short-acting anaesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Typically, people with that much ketamine in their systems are in general aesthesia during surgery, and being monitored by professionals, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other contributing factors in his death were drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of the opioid-addiction medicine buprenorphine, which was also detected in his system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of drug and alcohol abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends." He had been sober for 19 months with no known relapses before his death, according to interviews cited in his autopsy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witness interviews in the autopsy report said he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, so the ketamine found in his system by medical examiners would have been introduced since that last infusion, the autopsy said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda pair of Ying Ying and Le Le have finally produced babies, after they successfully mated in March this year at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After five months of pregnancy, Ying Ying gave birth to one female and one male in the small hours of Thursday. Ocean Park, where the giant panda lives, said she spent much of her time lying on the ground and twisting, and that she was in labour for more than five hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ocean Park Hong Kong is thrilled to welcome the birth of the first-ever giant panda twins in Hong Kong," the amusement park said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This birth is a true rarity, especially considering Ying Ying is the oldest giant panda on record to have successfully given birth for the first time," the park said, adding that she gave birth just one day before her 19th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilise, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth. Currently, both babies are under 24-hour intensive care by the park’s animal care and veterinary team, as well as experts from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee called the birth of the panda twins a very special occasion, and thanked the nation for having gifted Ying Ying and Le Le to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Ocean Park's team for taking good care of the city's giant pandas and experts from the research centre for their support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested the driver of a tram involved in a fatal crash that killed a three-year-old girl in Western District on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tram was travelling along the eastbound track of Praya, Kennedy Town at 10.40am, officers said. But when it approached the pedestrian crossing near Des Voeux Road West, it reportedly knocked down four people who were crossing the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year-old girl was trapped under the tram and was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital in an unconscious state. She was certified dead at about 12.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A six-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man also sustained injuries and were sent to the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 48-year-old male driver on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and that he is currently being detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For their part, Hong Kong Tramways said that according to their preliminary understanding, the tram was operating as usual when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that they suspended the driver after the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it is very concerned about the incident and that it has asked the tramway operator to investigate it in detail and submit a report as soon as possible.

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s populist Pheu Thai party on Thursday nominated its party chief, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, in a Parliament vote for the country’s new leader after former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was removed by a court order over an ethical violation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn said she was ready to work for the country to move it forward and promised give her best, after securing her candidacy for prime minister by the governing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined, together and will push the country forward," she told a press conference ahead of Friday's parliamentary vote on a new premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is seen as force behind Pheu Thai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the first Thai politician ever to win an overall majority of seats. The residual popularity of Thaksin is a factor in the support for Paetongtarn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Paetongtarn is approved by Parliament's vote she would become Thailand’s second female prime minister, and the country’s third leader from the Shinwatra family after her father and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government also said measures to attract talent and import labour were having a positive impact. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766319_1_20240815175637.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population fell by 0.1 percent between mid-2023 and the middle of 2024, according to government estimates released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures by the Census and Statistics Department showed that the SAR's population slid from 7,536,100 in mid-2023, to 7,531,800 in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the territory saw a net outflow of 30,200 residents, but 44,000 one-way permit holders came to the SAR, resulting in a net inflow of 13,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the population saw a small increase in the first half of 2024 due to the introduction of various government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Benefiting from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation, there was sizeable inflow of persons from the mainland and other places around the world to Hong Kong in the first half of 2024," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Yip, a population expert from the University of Hong Kong, said authorities had to work on retaining talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to make the people who decided to come to Hong Kong, stay in Hong Kong...I think we also have to diversify our portfolio. Not only from mainland China, we also like to attract, some foreign talent from other places too," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to make Hong Kong to be a truly cosmopolitan city, I think we do need talent to come from different places, [like] the Belt and Road countries and also Europe or the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures showed that Hong Kong saw 34,400 births last year, a five percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies, along with other proposals to promote births, was announced in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said the policies announced last October might not be reflected in the official data yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be very interesting to see whether there would be any substantial increase in 2024. But I think even if there is any impact, it will be quite limited," he said.

    Bargain hunters snap up deals at Food Expo

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's largest food festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Thursday, with enthusiastic bargain hunters racing inside as the doors opened at 10am sharp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some of the visitors to Food Expo said they had queued up overnight just to snap up bargains or freebies, such as ready-to-eat abalone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were looking to rediscover old favourites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We bought some Taiwanese rice flour noodles, because we went to Taiwan before so I just want my kids to try again," said a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourists were also at the exhibition centre to sample new flavours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just got some coffee and some coffee beans. I'm from Australia so we really like coffee over there. I've got some peanut chocolate butter as well, that's really nice. Hadn't seen that before," Andrew Frank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully the customs doesn't take it away from me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vendors, on the other hand, seized the chance to learn about the preferences of local customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Illugi Gunnarsson, who distributes Icelandic farm products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very good opportunity for us to meet people from Hong Kong, really see how they react to our products. But it also gives us an opportunity to sell, of course we like that, but mainly to understand our customers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau, meanwhile, underlined the contribution the convention and exhibition industry makes to the SAR's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The convention and exhibition industry has always been crucial to Hong Kong's economy by attracting high-spending overnight business visitors to Hong Kong, spurring economic activities and creating employment opportunities," Yau remarked at an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am glad to know that this week's fairs have gathered over 1,800 high-quality exhibitors from 28 countries and regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expo will take place until Monday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan lifted on Thursday a week-old warning that a "megaquake", potentially causing colossal damage and loss of life could strike, with the government telling people their lives could now "go back to normal".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alert that such a catastrophe might hit the archipelago of 125 million people prompted thousands of Japanese to cancel holidays and stock up on essentials, emptying shelves in some stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there were no abnormalities detected in seismic activity and crustal deformation, the special call for attention ended at 5pm," disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it doesn't mean the risk [of a major earthquake] has been eliminated," Matsumura told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been asking for special precautions, such as sleeping while being prepared to evacuate immediately. But we will no longer ask for these steps, and the people of Japan are free to go back to normal lifestyles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Thursday, Japan's weather agency said the likelihood of a megaquake was "higher than normal" following a magnitude 7.1 jolt earlier in the day that injured 15 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a particular kind of tremor known as a subduction megathrust quake, which in the past has occurred in pairs and can unleash massive tsunamis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advisory concerned the Nankai Trough between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 800-kilometre undersea gully runs parallel to Japan's Pacific coast, including off the Tokyo region, the world's biggest urban area and home to around 40 million people. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Thursday said it recorded about four million visitor arrivals in July, with about half involving overnight stays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure was a 10 percent increase on the same month last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 80 percent of July's visitors came from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said Hong Kong received about 25 million visitors in the first seven months of this year, over 50 percent more than the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the city held several events, including drone shows and pyrotechnic displays, adding that a survey of tourists found more than 90 percent believed the drone shows had enhanced their visit experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said it will organise drone shows and pyrotechnic displays during Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas and New Year's Eve, and will stage a new year countdown fireworks performance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association on Thursday said it welcomed a possible relaxation of the eligibility criteria for a talent attraction programme, saying it would draw more professionals to the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the moment, graduates of the world's top 100 universities are eligible to move to the SAR under the scheme. On Monday, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government is considering expanding the list of universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who founded the association, said at a press briefing that an expansion would boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This plan would give more support to Hong Kong's economy, and provide more and more entrepreneurs coming to Hong Kong and make more startups in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang also urged the government to offer more support to the children of professionals arriving in Hong Kong through the programme, saying they might encounter challenges when adapting to a new educational environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called on employers to provide housing allowances to incoming professionals due to accommodation costs in the city.

 A three-year-old girl has died after being struck by a tram and getting trapped beneath it in Western District.

    NGOs urged to spend more on cybersecurity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Francis Fong says NGOs should treat cybersecurity as a recurring expense. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766262_1_20240815122329.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An IT expert on Thursday urged NGOs, schools, and hospitals to prioritise cybersecurity spending, warning they are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This advice came after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data estimated that roughly 470,000 people's personal data was stolen in a cyberattack against Oxfam Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, the honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation and an Oxfam council member, told RTHK the council had instructed team members to notify all affected individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong explained that a key reason NGOs were prone to attacks was because of widespread work-from-home practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the pandemic because we used to work from home...We normally use a VPN to get into the office server so you can work remotely. But the problem is if you have not updated the firmware of the firewall, the VPN, the OS of the workstation server, even your antivirus or your security software, there are possibly many loopholes the hackers can attack the network and get the data from the server.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said staff awareness was lacking, noting many attacks were caused by employees tapping on suspicious web links or phishing emails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong pointed to the need for a shift in organisations’ mindsets over cybersecurity spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the past, we all thought this was just like one-off expense for security measures, but now because of so many attacks, these expenses [should] become like a regular expense, at least like a yearly expense,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So you should actually update all your servers. You have to buy subscriptions of your firewall and your security software, so that you are being properly protected, and you have to do security audits at least once a year.”

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Warner Cheuk says a big wetland park planned in the Northern Metropolis will enable the co-existence of development and conservation. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766260_1_20240815121421.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments on Thursday signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in areas such as conservation and pollution control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pact was signed during a ceremony at the University of Hong Kong to mark National Ecology Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement is also aimed at stepping up joint efforts to combat climate change, ecological promotion and education, as well as preserving biodiversity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said the SAR government has always tried its best to preserve nature, as part of efforts to build a beautiful China and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always stressed the need for people to co-exist with nature and adheres to President Xi Jinping's philosophy that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively setting up the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, which would be five times larger than the current wetland park. This would enhance the biodiversity and quality of the natural habitat in the Deep Bay area," Cheuk said in a speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also enhances the environmental capacity of the Northern Metropolis and achieves the co-existence of development and conservation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that over the next fortnight, the administration will team up with dozens of non-governmental organisations to hold a number of activities encouraging conservation, including free ecological tours and free admission to facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Shenzhen top official on natural resources, Xu Songming, said the pact between the two governments will allow a new level of mutual governance and sharing on ecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Shenzhen has always learned from Hong Kong's good example in terms of environmental protection, calling the SAR "the world's model city" for its green and low carbon developments.

    China retail sales improve, but factory output slows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's factory output growth slowed and missed expectations in July, but consumption figures were better than expected for that period. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766264_1_20240815122932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales rebounded in July while industrial production growth slowed, official data showed Thursday, highlighting an uneven recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Industrial output grew 5.1 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, slowing from the 5.3 percent pace in June and below expectations for a 5.2 percent increase in a Reuters poll of analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the NBS' monthly activity indicators showed retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.7 percent in July, quickening from a two percent increase in June and beating expectations for growth of 2.6 percent, a sign efforts to boost household spending were getting some traction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the jobs front, China's labour market remained stable in the January-July period as the surveyed urban unemployment rate dropped on a year-on-year basis, according to NBS data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average of surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first seven months of 2024, down 0.2 percentage points from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July alone, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, up from five percent in June but still lower than 5.3 percent a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts warn the broader outlook remained challenging for policymakers, suggesting more stimulus measures will be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data shows that the economy has gotten off to a weak start in the second half of the year, and it is expected that the probability of replacing MLF with a RRR cut will increase, but key to maintaining five percent economic growth remains the arrival of fiscal spending," said ANZ China market economist Xing Zhaopeng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was referring to the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending facility and reserve requirement ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the central bank injected cash through a short-term bond instrument and said it would conduct an MLF rollover later this month as it extends liquidity support to the financial system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's central bank at a meeting earlier this month said it would step up financial support to the broader economy and efforts would be directed more at consumers to spur consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with domestic demand weak and the outlook unclear, households and businesses are in no rush to borrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for more growth boosting measures have dogged officials ever since a widely expected post-pandemic recovery failed to materialise in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded 3.6 percent in the first seven months of 2024 year-on-year, but also missed expectations for a 3.9 percent rise and also slowed from the 3.9 percent growth in the January to June period. (Agencies and Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned, coming nearly four months after the Ivy League university was rocked by campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766252_1_20240815105933.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the prestigious New York college grapple with protests over the Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions related to the conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anti-war protests and encampments at Columbia and campuses across the United States were a flashpoint in debates about US support for Israel in its campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics said the protests at Columbia and elsewhere veered into anti-Semitism and intimidation, culminating in Shafik being questioned before the US Congress along with other university presidents and accused of not keeping Jewish students safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters -- many of whom were themselves Jewish -- said demonstrators' anti-Israel views were being conflated with anti-Semitism. They also said that individual allegations of hate incidents were being used to distract from calls for a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead," Shafik wrote in an email announcing the move, according to student newspaper the Columbia Spectator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am making this announcement now so that new leadership can be in place before the new term begins."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests and encampments spread across US universities, protesters at times occupied buildings. In some cases there were clashes with police, while at other times pro-Israel protesters attacked the encampments. (Agencies)
