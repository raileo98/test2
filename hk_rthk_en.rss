    Abundant land supply helps keep prices in check: CE

  <img alt='John Lee says transparency on land supply means developers will have to keep prices "in accordance with the actual situation."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said Hong Kong has enough land alloted for housing that should prevent any acute shortages over the next few decades, and also help keep prices in check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was responding to a caller on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   asking whether the government’s reserve prices for land sales effectively keeps prices largely unaffordable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee stressed that land is a precious asset that belongs to the people and should be valued accordingly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also noted that he had in his Policy Address this week introduced measures to help prospective homebuyers by increasing how much they can borrow from banks for mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While noting that there is “still more” the government needs to do, he stressed that the government has accelerated its pace in securing land for housing, and the 7,000 hectares of land now available for residential use over the next three decades means there shouldn’t be any shortage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If there's more land supply, then the price of land will be suitably set according to [the actual] market situation. The big shortage that appeared previously should not happen that abruptly now,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also said developers will have to keep prices tethered to reality as everyone knows there’s adequate supply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Everybody knows how much land and when it will be available, and the price set by the developers will have to be in accordance with the actual situation and then all the calculations can be done by even the normal citizen,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also played down the possibility that new proposed restrictions on subdivided flats could create a shortage and drive prices up, as the government is set to propose new legislation requiring all flats to be at least 86 square feet in size, have windows and an individual toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there are clear financial incentives for people to supple small, affordable units for rent, as research shows they would earn several times more from renting out subdivided units compared to one single apartment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There is a strong business case for the market to develop,” he said. “Once the rules are clear, then I think it’s only natural for those who have been benefiting or who see this as a beneficial business will then develop it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there should be ample time for this new supply to emerge, since the entire process of legislation and registration, along with a grace period, means the new rules would only fully be in place in “a few years.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think the market will ensure that the right rent is set,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also repeated his call for all various business sectors here to reform and evolve to  adapt to the changing conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The economy isn't doing badly because we are still strongly in the belief that the overall economy will grow between 2.5 to 3.5 percent,” he said. “That means the macro economy is positive, but micro-economy, particularly for some sectors, they may have to think of new ways of doing things as to make themselves attractive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the Chief Executive spent most of the hour-long phone-in programme explaining his new policies, he got some new ideas from callers as well, including from Vic – who asked John Lee if he could do anything to pave the way for motorcyclists to ride their bikes directly across the border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The questioned appeared to stir up the CE’s passion as a car enthusiast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Obviously, I enjoy driving as well,” Lee responded. “So I do look forward to the time when I do retire, then I will personally drive to different parts of the world, in particularly the GBA and other mainland cities.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “So I do understand why you want to have your own bike and drive up to the mainland – it's easy and also China being a big country you really have a lot to see, really a lot to enjoy. I can't make my promise but definitely you have made a new point which I find attractive”, he said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cleveland's David Fry smashed the game-winning home run in the 10th inning on Thursday to give the Guardians a dramatic 7-5 victory over the New York Yankees on Thursday in the Major League Baseball playoffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians, one out from defeat, made a stunning fightback to pull within 2-1 of the Yankees in the in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series, which continues Friday in Cleveland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When everybody thinks we can't do it, we think we can," Fry said. "What a win. That was so good – it was fun."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ALCS winner will play in the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers, who meet later Thursday in game four of the National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton hit back-to-back homers in the eighth inning and New York added an insurance run in the ninth for a 5-3 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But in the bottom of the ninth with the hosts down to their final out, Cleveland pinch-hitter Jhonkensy Noel smashed a two-run homer into the left-field stands, the Dominican rookie lifting the Guardians level 5-5 to force extra innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York stranded two base runners in the top of the 10th, setting the stage for Cleveland's walk-off win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bo Naylor singled and took second base on Brayan Rocchio's sacrifice bunt before Fry smashed the game-winning homer off Yankees relief pitcher Clay Holmes over the left-field wall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Not many times do I know the ball has left here to left field, but I had a really good feeling," Fry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Amazing. I still don't know what happened but it ended up we won," he added. "It's so awesome, it's surreal. We've got a lot more to do, though, but it was fun tonight."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to recover from the near-miss for game four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They scratched and clawed their way back in," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "Sucks losing like that, but we'll be ready to roll tomorrow."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees have not reached the World Series since winning their record 27th title in 2009 while Cleveland , which last reached the World Series in 2016, has not captured the crown since 1948. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said it is important to promote Hong Kong's brand as a good education hub around the world to encourage more people to study in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on RTHK's phone-in programme on Friday, he said the territory was working on becoming a global education hub, with five of its universities in the top 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it was important to maintain a strong educational standard among all institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will introduce the law to ensure that the standard is set, to ensure the Hong Kong education standard is a standard that has been as good as always has been, so to attract more people to join the education sector and allow more students to come to satisfy their individual needs," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The whole game plan is to ensure that we grow in different areas, be attractive to students around the world, to satisfy different aspirations of students in different parts of the world, particularly Belt and Road countries."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said that additional support centres for ethnic minorities groups have been set up in different districts, to provide interpretation and translation services to reduce language barrier concerns for those looking for a job in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that reform has been made to the Employees Retraining Board to ensure that people are equipped with the right skills and training for employment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Instead of just training people for jobs, then we have now think that it's more appropriate to design courses to train people with skills. When we talk about skills, we need to know what kind of skills are required for employees to get good jobs in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Rather than trying to learn to chase for jobs, we increase the potential and abilities for every employee, so that they have skills and they can pick the jobs."

    China economic growth slows further, but output rises

  <img alt="Quarterly growth slowed further year-on-year, but consumption and output rose. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775107_1_20241018104422.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China posted its slowest growth in a year and a half on Friday, as Beijing struggles to steady an economy shaken by sluggish spending and persistent property sector woes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials have in recent weeks unveiled a string of measures to reignite the world's number-two economy, with an eye to achieving five percent annual growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But after a blistering market rally fuelled by hopes for a long-awaited "bazooka stimulus", optimism has tapered as authorities refrained from providing a specific figure for the bailout or detailing any of the pledges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the economy expanded 4.6 percent year on year in the third quarter, down from 4.7 percent in the previous three months and the slowest since early 2023, when China was emerging from its zero-COVID policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, it was slightly better than the 4.5 percent predicted by analysts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other data also released on the day, including industrial output and retail sales for September, beat expectations in an encouraging sign for policymakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The property sector, though, continued to show weakness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest data comes as authorities have started to sharply increase stimulus measures in an effort to ensure the economy meets the government's 2024 growth target of around five percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has said it has "full confidence" in achieving its annual growth goal, but economists say more direct fiscal stimulus is needed to revive activity and restore business confidence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Recent weeks have seen authorities unveil a raft of measures to funnel cash into the economy including a string of rate cuts and loosened restrictions on home-buying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But investors are clamouring for more specifics on how Beijing will shift its economy towards a consumption-driven model that can sustain long-term growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, China's finance minister pledged to "significantly increase" debt to revive growth, but left investors guessing on the overall size of the stimulus package.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China may raise an additional six trillion yuan from special treasury bonds over three years to help bolster the sagging economy through expanded fiscal stimulus, Caixin Global reported, citing multiple sources with knowledge of the matter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A major headache has been a prolonged crisis in the property sector, which has long been a key driver of growth but is now mired in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, official data showed that China's new home prices fell at the fastest pace since May 2015, despite increased efforts to revive the sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In annual terms, new home prices were down 5.8 percent from a year earlier, deeper than a 5.3 percent slide in August, according to Reuters calculations based on NBS data.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New home prices were down for the 15th consecutive month, falling 0.7 percent month-on-month in September, matching a dip in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In recent weeks, China has introduced supportive measures, including lower mortgage rates, and eased home purchase restrictions, which have spurred some demand in major cities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, Beijing announced plans to expand the "white list" of eligible housing projects and increase bank lending to four trillion yuan by year-end, in a bid to stabilise the ailing real estate sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also promised to facilitate the renovation of a million homes, a move intended to boost activity in the property sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there was encouraging news as official data showed China's industrial output in September grew 5.4 percent from a year earlier, up from a 4.5 percent pace in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The official data from the NBS on Friday beat expectations for a 4.5 percent rise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 3.2 percent in September, accelerating from a 2.1 percent growth in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fixed asset investment expanded 3.4 percent in the first nine months from a year earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It rose 3.4 percent in the January-to-August period. (Agencies)

    Chinese banks cut interest rates on yuan deposits

  <img alt="China's major banks cut interest rates on yuan deposits for the second time this year. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775090_1_20241018094007.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's top banks on Friday cut interest rates on deposits in yuan for the second time this year, state media said, as Beijing seeks to boost sluggish consumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate was cut by 25 basis points to 1.1 percent, according to the official deposit interest rates released by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the second deposit interest rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024, with the previous cut implemented in July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, China's central bank and financial regulators have held meetings with key financial institutions, urging them to swiftly implement expansive policies to support the economy and the capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website on Friday that it urged participants to boost credit support for the real economy, and maintain reasonable growth in the total amount of money and credit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also urged solid implementation of interest rate adjustments, as well as two funding schemes created to support the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's banking and securities regulators also chaired the meeting, and participants included banks, brokerages and fund companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also on Friday, the governor of China's central bank, Pan Gongsheng, warned against any illegal fund flows into the stock market, state media said, following recent measures to support domestic capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC introduced two new tools in September to support markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were a swap programme giving funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding for stock buys, and relatively cheap PBOC loans to help banks finance listed companies' share purchases and buybacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a financial forum in Beijing, Pan said the two measures were based entirely on market-oriented principles, and the swap facility was not a form of direct financial support from the central bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank's provisions regarding stock buybacks and purchases have specific directional aims, and the fundamental bottom line was that loan funds must not unlawfully enter the stock market, Pan added. (Xinhua/Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks closed in mixed territory on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite once more buoyed by renewed interest in chipmakers and designers like Nvidia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 percent to end at a new record of 43,239.05, while the S&P 500 Index lost less than 0.1 percent to close at 5,841.47.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose less than 0.1 percent to close at 18,373.61, as chip design titan Nvidia saw its share price rise 0.9 percent on the back of a 9.8 percent rise in chipmaker TSMC's shares on strong third quarter results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traders were also digesting fresh data published on Thursday showing an acceleration in retail sales last month, and another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank (ECB).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mill Street Research chief strategist Sam Burns told AFP that the positive economic news in the US, and rate cut in Europe, had helped stocks to return to near all-time highs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Earnings reports so far have been pretty good and there doesn't seem to be too much concern, at least so far, about the election and things like that," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among other firms, streaming giant Netflix's shares rose in after-hours trading after it announced it had topped earnings expectations in the third quarter. (AFP)

    Alcaraz defeats Nadal in Six Kings semi-finals

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rafael Nadal admitted his fitness level was well off the tour's top players after falling Thursday in straight sets to fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, who described the exhibition match as "a little bit sad".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old Nadal, who announced last week he would retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month, lost 6-3, 6-3 to 21-year-old Alcaraz in the semi-finals of the "Six Kings Slam" event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afterwards he described Alcaraz, winner of the French Open and Wimbledon this year, as an "animal" and acknowledged he was not competing at the highest level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have not much pressure here. I'm just trying to have fun," he told a post-match press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I know I'm going to play against players that – are in much better shape than me because they are on the professional tour and winning tournaments."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz said he knew the Saudi crowd was against him but wanted to let Nadal, winner of 22 Grand Slams including 14 French Open titles, bask in the support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a little bit sad – it was not a really comfortable moment for me. Obviously I really wanted to win," said Alcaraz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once you step on the court it's no friends, no idols" but "I think this is his moment right now," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prior to Thursday's match Nadal had made his last singles appearance at the Olympic Games in Paris where his campaign was cut short by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had also teamed-up with Alcaraz in men's doubles at the Games and may reprise that role at the Davis Cup Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal will play Djokovic again on Saturday after the Serbian great lost a much tighter match to Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner, who prevailed 6-2, 6-7, 6-4 and will take on Alcaraz in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having Novak in front, it's like a nostalgic thing," Nadal said, looking ahead to their battle for third place in the Saudi exhibition. "We faced each other plenty of times, so it's going to be good fun to play each other again one more time in this match."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for the Davis Cup Finals next month, Nadal said he was unclear what his form would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Emotionally I'm sure I will be ready. In terms of physically, in terms of tennis level – there's still a month to prepare," he said, adding that he would not hesitate to speak up if he thought he could not compete well in singles. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Skipper Rohit Sharma on Thursday said he was "hurting" after opting to bat first on a seaming pitch as hosts India fell to a dismal 46 all out against New Zealand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kiwi fast bowlers Matt Henry and William O'Rourke wreaked havoc in overcast conditions to dismiss India in 31.2 overs on the first Test's second afternoon in Bengaluru.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was India's third-lowest Test score ever and lowest at home, worse than their 75 against the West Indies in New Delhi in 1987.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their lowest overall is 36 against Australia in a pink-ball Adelaide Test in 2020. They fell for 42 against England at Lord's in 1974.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We felt there was not much grass on the pitch and it will do whatever it has to do in the first couple of sessions and then it is going to take a turn as the game goes on," Rohit told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expected the wicket to be flatter than what it turned out to be. So clearly misjudgement of the pitch," he added. "Obviously, I didn't read the pitch enough and we sit in that situation today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five Indian batsmen including Virat Kohli got out for a duck as Henry and O'Rourke shared nine wickets between them in a rare show of domination by opposition bowlers in India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am hurting a little bit because I made that call," said Rohit. "But we want to challenge ourselves. This time it didn't come off, the challenge that was thrown at us."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former captain Tim Southee drew first blood as he bowled Rohit through the gate. Fellow quick O'Rourke silenced the crowd when he sent back Kohli for nought.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Henry wrapped up the innings with a five-wicket haul and his last strike of Kuldeep Yadav was his 100th Test wicket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a good toss to lose," said Henry. "It was quite nice when those clouds started coming in. I think we were expecting it to be a flatter wicket but there was plenty of assistance this morning – it was great that we could make the most of it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have the upper hand with a lead of 134 as they ended the day on 180-3 after Devon Conway's 91. Henry warned his team against letting their guard down.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can't be complacent at all," he said. "We've just got to keep mounting pressure." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A superb 74 not out from Anneke Bosch fired South Africa into the Women's T20 World Cup final as they demolished defending champions Australia by eight wickets in Dubai on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Set 135 to win, South Africa reached their target with 16 balls to spare, with Bosch, who struck eight fours and a six in her 48-ball innings, sharing a match-winning partnership of 96 with skipper Laura Wolvaardt (42).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Sunday's final, which will be the first not to feature one of Australia or England, the South Africans will face either West Indies or New Zealand who meet in the second semi-final on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia, who have won six of the previous eight editions, had been the odds-on favourites to win a seventh title in the United Arab Emirates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they had no answer to South Africa for whom this marked a measure of revenge for defeat by Australia in last year's final in Cape Town.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think this is one of the best wins of my cricketing career for sure. A couple of other girls have said it as well," said Wolvaardt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that was such an amazing chase," she added. "The bowlers are excellent. It's been a good year for us – I think it's been a real collective group effort." (AFP)

    Formula One to drop fastest lap bonus point

  <img alt="The FIA made the announcement ahead of the United States Grand Prix. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775074_1_20241018081351.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Formula One is scrapping from next year the award of a bonus point for fastest lap in a race, introduced with much fanfare just five years ago, governing body the FIA said Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bonus point was awarded originally in the 1950s, but then dropped before being reintroduced in 2019 for the lap, if the driver finishes in the top ten.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has potential significance in a long season of 24 races, as this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The FIA (International Motoring Federation) made the announcement ahead of this weekend's United States Grand Prix among changes to the 2024 and 2025 sporting and technical regulations after approval by the World Motor Sport Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In another change, a requirement to run a young driver during free practice is to increase from once per car per season to twice per car per season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The significance of the fastest lap was shown at last month's Singapore Grand Prix where RB's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo pitted for new tyres to set the fastest lap in his final race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RB are a sister team to Red Bull and thereby deprived rivals like McLaren and their title-challenging driver Lando Norris of a possible additional point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris held the fastest lap and bonus point as the race entered its final laps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ricciardo was 18th and not eligible to score a bonus point, but he was called to pit and duly set the lap, depriving Norris of a point. (AFP)

    Biden heads to Germany to discuss Middle East

  <img alt="US President Joe Biden gets ready to board Air Force One in Maryland. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775044_1_20241017214236.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US President Joe Biden took off  onThursday on a swift farewell trip to Germany, for talks with allies to shore up Ukraine's increasingly desperate fight against Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also expected to discuss the escalating crisis in the Middle East, as Israel said it was investigating whether Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar had been killed in a military operation in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a flying 24-hour visit to Berlin, the US leader will meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, before they are both joined for talks by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was originally due in Germany last week for a multi-day visit that would have included a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a major summit of Kyiv's allies, but he postponed it as Hurricane Milton barrelled towards Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The White House said the shorter, rescheduled visit to the key Nato ally would "further strengthen the close bond the United States and Germany share as allies and friends and coordinate on geopolitical priorities, including Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression and events in the Middle East."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also keen to make the visit to thank Scholz for facilitating a prisoner exchange deal with Russia earlier this year that freed US reporter Evan Gershkovich, US officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the focus will be on Ukraine, with Biden, who dropped out of the 2024 White House race in July, keen to consolidate Western military aid for Kyiv in his final three months in office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Allies are nervously watching the November 5 US presidential election to see if it brings a return of Donald Trump, who has opposed the current level of US support for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has also repeatedly pledged to push through a peace deal if elected -- even before taking office -- that Kyiv fears would involve it giving up chunks of land to Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky told allies in Brussels on Thursday that Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kyiv is slowly but steadily losing territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden announced a fresh US$425 million arms package including air defense and armored vehicles for Ukraine in a call with Zelensky on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States is by far the biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine's battle against the 2022 Russian invasion, followed by Germany. (AFP)

    US retail sales accelerate, beat expectations

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Retail sales in the United States accelerated in September, according to government data released on Thursday, even as auto and gas station sales remained tepid for the month -- a positive sign as the election approaches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Overall sales rose 0.4 percent to US$714.4 billion between August and September, according to Commerce Department data, beating analysts' expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, sales edged up just 0.1 percent to US$711.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Excluding auto and gas station sales, the overall monthly rise would have been even higher at 0.7 percent in September, the report added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the US central bank had kept interest rates high for a large part of the year -- raising the cost of borrowing for households and businesses to tamp down inflation -- consumer spending has been more robust than expected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Households have been drawing down on savings from the Covid-19 pandemic period, and the economy could be given a further boost with the Federal Reserve starting to lower rates more recently.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Compared with the same month a year ago, retail sales were up 1.7 percent in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon Macroeconomics noted in a recent report that "with growth in labour income slowing, credit conditions remaining tight and households recently having exhausted their excess savings, we expect growth to slow sharply over the next couple of quarters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon analysts added that "Hurricane Helene probably landed too late in the month" to have an impact on the sales figures, "and was too localized to have a major impact on national sales." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Israeli military on Thursday announced the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by its forces in southern Gaza the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military "confirms that after a year-long pursuit, yesterday (Wednesday), October 16, 2024, IDF (military) soldiers from the Southern Command eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip," it said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and the ISA (Shin Bet internal security agency) over the last year and in recent weeks in the area where he was eliminated restricted Yahya Sinwar's operational movement as he was pursued by the forces and led to his elimination," the military added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "IDF soldiers of the 828th Brigade (Bislach) operating in the area identified and eliminated three terrorists. The process of identifying the body confirms the elimination of Yahya Sinwar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel accuses Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, along with Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military has said Deif was killed in a strike earlier this year, though the Palestinian group has not confirmed it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, Sinwar took over as the leader of Hamas, following the death of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran on July 31. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hamas attack last year resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli soil, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures that include hostages killed in captivity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed 42,438 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN acknowledges the figures reliability. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday said Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs in Brussels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kiev is slowly but steadily losing new territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ukraine is ready for real diplomacy, but for it, we must be strong," Zelensky said as he headed into talks with the EU's 27 leaders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A forcefully imposed truce instead of fair peace never provided security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Russia will resort to diplomacy only when it sees that it cannot achieve anything by force," Zelensky added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is the plan. This is exactly what's needed, and we must create the right conditions to end this war."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the EU summit Zelensky was to join defence ministers for the first of two days of talks between NATO's 32 member states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While calling it a "strong signal," NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte cautioned ahead of time he was not endorsing Zelensky's "whole plan" -- which calls first and foremost for an immediate invitation to join the alliance, a plea widely seen as unrealistic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky's plan also rejects any territorial concessions, calls for Western allies to lift restrictions on using donated long-range weapons to target Russian military sites, and suggests deploying a "non-nuclear strategic deterrence package" on Ukrainian territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian leader has travelled in recent weeks to Washington, Paris, Berlin, Rome and London to defend his plan -- unveiled to Ukrainian lawmakers Wednesday -- but it has yet to earn backing from Western capitals. (AFP)

    'People who lose subdivided flats will be rehoused'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday said it is confident that its plan to get rid of poor quality subdivided flats will not leave residents homeless and there'll be plenty of public housing available for them.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said a registration system will be introduced, and subdivided units will have to be at least eight square metres in size, with a window and separate toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a media briefing on Thursday, officials added that other requirements will include that rooms have a height of at least 2.3 metres, that the window opens into an area that isn't enclosed on all sides, and that the toilet has a ventilation system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The units must also comply with fire safety regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 30 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units are expected to fall foul of the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 12-18 month registration period is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of next year, with owners given a grace period of up to two years following registration to comply with the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said there's an abundant supply of public housing for residents of flats that don't make the grade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We've looked at the current composition of the residents of subdivided units. About 60 percent will be eligible for public housing. So the key is to provide an adequate quantity of public housing units, and that's something, I will say, where we are succeeding,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For the coming five years, even if we do not count the number of light public housing, we're able to provide more than 30,000 public housing units every year.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said tenants affected could also move into transitional housing or subdivided flats that do meet the minimum standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Housing Rosanna Law said rewards of about HK$3,000 will be offered to people who provide tip-offs about public housing tenancy abuse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move will be part of the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" to be launched by the Housing Authority in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Law said people will only get a reward once a recovery notice for a flat is issued, saying the authorities are setting conditions to deter indiscriminate reporting.

    'Guangdong care homes more suited for physically fit'

  <img alt="The three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving CSSA to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated homes in Guangdong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775010_1_20241017181134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A professor in geriatric medicine said the new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in special homes in Guangdong would be attractive to those who are relatively healthy and fit, but she said the option is not ideal for those who cannot care for themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jean Woo, from the Chinese University's Faculty of Medicine, made the comment after Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address on Wednesday that the three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people, who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She told RTHK that it may be very difficult for the elderly with serious illnesses or disabilities to cope with a new environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What happens as you get older and older, nobody really knows, because we don't know what the healthcare support is like. If you have various chronic diseases, how easy is it to access primary care, follow-up, and so on," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Healthcare vouchers could be used on the mainland and certainly in some of the hospitals there, so I think that's a great help. So when you start to decline with your brain not working too well and physically you're not moving so well, what would be the situation? What about your social network, your family? There are a lot of unknowns," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I suspect the plan is not to move this group, but to have an option for people who are now living in the community, but wanted to be in an environment where they don't want to cook or do housework, or they want some social activities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, she said the quality and services in local residential care homes (RCHs) would go up, after the chief executive said there would be additional manpower support through the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for RCHs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we need to do something further upstream to slow down the decline into dependency by having initiatives in the community. But as I said, it's better than nothing," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a good direction to go because we are very short of people, the training and so on. But I think the salary needs to perhaps go up a bit more to attract people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In terms of the government's plan to step up support for caregivers by extending their current service of sending community care teams to households in need to other parts of the city, Woo said care teams are great for the elderly because they are equipped with the right training.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From a geriatrician's point of view, we're used to screening multiple domains and we've been doing this using an automatic format and we have created an app so that we can train people in terms of what to look out [for], and watch out for things," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There's a lot we can do before we even get to the doctors and the nurses, and the medications."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Thursday said the London Metal Exchange (LME) is looking into listing Hong Kong as a delivery point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui told reporters that the LME had earlier expressed a desire to set up a warehouse in the city, and it is exploring practical ways to do so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now the process is on their side, in terms of assessing the legal environment here, in terms of whether and how it can meet the criteria to be admitted as a delivery point by LME. I think that's the first step they need to take, before other warehouse companies can choose to locate their warehouses here," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have been in discussion with them, at the same time through our InvestHK, to facilitate any information and any assistance that they need from the government."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked if a site has been chosen, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said existing warehouses could be used if suitable, and it is not essential to build new facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, is a centre for the trading of industrial metals, with the majority of non-ferrous metal futures business transacted on its platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said the government will capitalise on opportunities to establish supporting facilities for the storage and delivery of commodities.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said the government had taken into consideration factors like property prices, the supply of housing and the city's economy, before it reduced the down payment needed to buy a flat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As announced in the chief executive's Policy Address yesterday, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for residential properties would be adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said property prices had come down and there would be sufficient housing supply, with over 108,000 first-hand units available in the next three to four years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We should let the market forces play. We should not unduly impose measures to suppress the demand, or try to prioritise different demands. Also, taking into consideration, at the moment, our banking sector is very healthy, very well-capitalised. The [number of] negative equity cases compared to 1998, for example, is much lower," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We do feel confident to remove those restrictions so that we would be able to project a more positive expectation... about the healthy and stable development of the Hong Kong property market in the coming future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan added that government revenue from land sales and stamp duties was lower than expectations, but it was too early to revise estimates on the fiscal deficit for the financial year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He expects Hong Kong to record further growth for the remainder of the year, with the start of the US Federal Reserve interest rate easing cycle giving the economy an added boost.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Six police officers have been jailed for 25 to 41 months each for perverting the course of justice relating to an operation involving homeless people in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The officers – Leung Fei-pang, Pong Chun-sze, Lam Wah-ka, Mok Chi-shing, Wan Pak-sze and Chan Sau-yip – were convicted last month of falsely accusing a man of possessing drugs, and blocking CCTV cameras during the operation in Sham Shui Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Thursday's sentencing, District Court judge Kathie Cheung said perverting the course of justice is a serious offence, and the officers had abused their powers and undermined public confidence in the force.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam, a sergeant and the most senior officer at the scene, was imprisoned for 41 months; Mok, Wan and Chan each received 37-month sentences; and Leung and Pong were each given 25-month jail terms.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   TSMC, the dominant producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, reported on Thursday a forecast-beating 54 percent jump in third-quarter profit on the back of soaring demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI across a spectrum of industries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC posted a net profit of T$325.3 billion (US$10.11 billion) for the quarter which ended September 30, compared with the T$300.2 billion predicted by analysts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said third-quarter revenue rose 36 percent year-on-year to US$23.5 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of up to US$23.2 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC is spending billions of dollars building new factories in other parts of the world, including US$65 billion on three plants in the US state of Arizona.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On its last earnings call in July, TSMC raised its full-year revenue forecast and adjusted its capital expenditure plans for this year to between US$30 billion and US$32 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI boom has helped drive up TSMC shares, with its Taipei-listed stock leaping 75 percent so far this year, compared with a 28 percent gain for the broader market, giving it a market capitalisation of around US$840 billion. (Reuters)

    CE says he hopes for good news soon on mainland visas

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that he hopes the SAR government's ideas to get more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong will "materialise soon".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee said the central government is pro-actively studying suggestions including the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and expanding the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco question and answer session on the address, retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu brought up the issue of visas, saying restaurants and shops are facing major challenges amid a sluggish economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said he hopes announcements can be made soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In our discussions with the central authorities, we adopt a pragmatic attitude, so we only put forward measures that work. Of course, we are not at liberty to reveal the measures that we are exploring," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen expressed concern that the wealth gap in Hong Kong is widening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said economic development might be hindered because "a good number of residents" don't actively participate in society and lack a sense of belonging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said it's normal for there to be various views in society and there is no need to exaggerate the differences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that he wants to build an inclusive and caring society, and said the government always keeps an open mind and is willing to listen to different views.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are always pointed questions or critical questions raised at press conferences and we will always try to answer those questions," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you come up with suggestions on ways to improve, some are well-intentioned and some are really poignant criticisms. And many of these actually become a part of the new measures in the Policy Address."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also noted that Canada's Fraser Institute has ranked the SAR as the world's freest economy in its latest report, saying this means people can engage in any economic activity in Hong Kong and be afforded the greatest level of freedom under local laws.

    India slams 'cavalier' Trudeau over separatist murder

  <img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has come under renewed attack from India over his handling of the killing of a Sikh separatist in Canada. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774958_1_20241017133828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   India criticised Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday as "cavalier" over his handling of the disastrous diplomatic fallout following the 2023 killing of a Sikh separatist in Canada.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Delhi held firm its defiant stance towards Ottawa -- an approach in sharp contrast to its compliant attitude this week towards the United States, where India is also accused of directing a separate assassination plot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada has alleged that India arranged the killing of a Sikh separatist, naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, murdered in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India has called the allegations "preposterous".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Trudeau, at a parliamentary inquiry on Wednesday, said Canada had "clear indications that India had violated Canada's sovereignty".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada's top envoy to New Delhi, Stewart Wheeler, who India has ordered to leave by Saturday night, has said Ottawa had provided "credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday said they had not seen that evidence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Canada has presented us (India) no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, the Indian government briefly curbed visas for Canadians and this week both countries expelled each other's ambassadors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Delhi's response to Washington has been very different, with the US State Department on Wednesday saying India had told it that an intelligence operative accused of directing an assassination plot on American soil was no longer in government service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US prosecutors charged an Indian citizen last November over a foiled attempt in New York to kill an advocate for a separate Sikh homeland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The indictment described an "Indian government employee," who was not publicly named, as recruiting the hitman and directing the assassination plot remotely, including by arranging the delivery of US$15,000 in cash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's Hindustan Times, quoting an unnamed US official, said on Monday that India not only removed but arrested the employee on "local charges."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The State Department did not confirm the arrest. (AFP)

    US uses stealth bombers to strike Houthi targets

  <img alt="The United States carried out B-2 bomber strikes on weapon storage facilities in areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebels, according to the US military and defence department. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774947_1_20241017121451.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   American long-range B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early on Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It wasn't immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it is incredibly rare for the B-2 Spirit to be used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin in a statement said the B-2 bombers targeted “five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor who have twice targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks over the last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,” Austin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Austin and the US military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships travelling through the waterway, which once saw US$1 trillion a year of cargo pass through it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started last October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a US-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the US or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Later on Thursday, the Houthis vowed to retaliate following the strike on the weapons storage facilities in areas controlled by the Iran-backed group.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We confirm that the American aggression will not pass without a response," said a statement from the group's political bureau. (Agencies)

    Quit dwelling on HK's past success, CE tells firms

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   It would be unrealistic to try to stop people from spending their free time across the border and abroad, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, amid complaints from local retailers and restaurants over flagging business as more Hongkongers choose to spend their money elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee advised the retail industry to acknowledge the structural change in consumption patterns, and address the problem by seeking reform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a joint radio phone-in programme, one day after delivering his third Policy Address, Lee said the SAR is undergoing a period of transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’s time to stop dwelling on the past success, he told businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Overall speaking, the retail industry isn’t doing really well. Even as we boost inbound tourism, we must first acknowledge the structural change of their consumption pattern," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everyone needs to keep improving – not just the one in front of you or next to you. Start with yourself. Of course the government will try to help, but there will be ups and downs," he said, adding that he aims to compress this "transition period" as much as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many Hong Kong retailers and restaurants also say they are struggling to compete for customers against rivals in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly one and half million Hong Kong residents left the city via various land border checkpoints over the Chung Yeung Festival long weekend, dealing a fresh blow to local businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Lee said this is only normal market behaviour, and the government will do its best to help local businesses, including looking at ways to tackle high rent and costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that being as Hong Kong’s economy is undergoing a period of change, one of the government’s roles is to look for new growth areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will now look into building a commodity trading ecosystem, leveraging on Hong Kong’s safe and free environment, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A “global trader” has signalled its intention to establish a metal warehouse in Hong Kong, Lee said, describing this as the perfect starting point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the chief executive pledged to forge full speed ahead with a plan to regulate subdivided homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has proposed a bill which will set a minimum size and other conditions for the units, and landlords which don't register their properties will be prosecuted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With an estimated 110,000 such units, Lee said one headache would be deciding how long the registration period should last.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm an impatient man...I said, how about 12 to 18 months? But with 110,000 units to deal with, and divided by 12 months, we have to register about 9,000 each month. Is this pragmatic? I would need to discuss this with my colleagues," he said.

    China boosts credit to shore up property market

  <img alt="Housing and Urban-Rural Development Minister Ni Hong leaves at the end of a press conference on China's property sector.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a "white list" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million "urban villages" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun," Ni told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In January, China announced a plan for a "white list" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Approved loans for the "white list" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)

  <img alt="John Lee says the Housing Authority will allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   An analyst at a local think-tank has welcomed this year's Policy Address as one focused on improving the quality of people's lives, saying the increased chances for young people to attain an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme would motivate them to climb up the housing ladder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jason Leung, the Head of Land and Housing at the Our Hong Kong Foundation, made the comment on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme on Thursday after Chief Executive John Lee said the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the past, if we are talking about Home Ownership Scheme flats, the numbers offered for sale each year is very low. It's about 3,000 to 4,000 a year perhaps. Now it's getting more and more and moving to about 8,000 to 9,000 per year. So it's slightly easier to get a flat in the balloting right now and especially with the new mechanism that people who previously were unsuccessful in the balloting could get you know more ballots," he said.

   <br/>
   "Youths could get a more preferential treatment as well. So the Home Ownership Scheme flats, these are more accessible to these people right now, and I think that this will be a positive direction for people to attain home ownership."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Leung said residents living in subdivided units that do not meet the minimum standards could potentially be moved to transitional housing given its flexible conditions, after Lee said the government would propose a new set of standards which include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you look at the distribution of transitional housing, actually there are quite a number of them that are in the urban areas as well, and as the government constructs more light public housing and public rental housing in the coming few years, existing tenants in the transitional housing could move on to these government-run housing programmes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The space in these transitional housing in the urban areas can then be released and hopefully used to house these people that could be affected by these subdivided units."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Far beneath the lush landscape of southern China, a sprawling subterranean laboratory aims to be the world's first to crack a deep scientific enigma.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China has emerged as a science powerhouse in recent years, with the country's leadership pouring billions of dollars into advanced research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its latest showpiece is the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno), a state-of-the-art facility for studying the minuscule subatomic particles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The project is an "exciting" opportunity to delve into some of the universe's most fundamental -- but elusive -- building blocks, according to Patrick Huber, director of the Center for Neutrino Physics at the American university Virginia Tech, who is not involved in the facility's research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International media was recently given a tour of the observatory in Kaiping, Guangdong province, organised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's national science agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lab is reached by a funicular train that travels down a tunnel to a cavern built 700 metres underground to limit radiation emissions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Inside stands the neutrino detector, a stainless steel and acrylic sphere around 35 metres in diameter, crisscrossed by cables.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "No one has built such a detector before," Wang Yifang, Juno's project manager and director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, said as workers in hard hats applied the finishing touches to the gleaming orb.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You can see from the scale, it was technologically complicated," Wang said as he waved a laser pen over different parts of the installation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Started in 2014, Juno has cost around 2.2 billion yuan to build and is due for completion next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It aims to solve a fundamental physics puzzle about the particles' nature faster than scientists in the United States, a world leader in the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its research could also help us better understand planet Earth, the Sun, and other stars and supernovas. (AFP)

    Alcaraz to face Nadal in Six Kings Slam semis

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Carlos Alcaraz admitted Wednesday it will be a "difficult moment" facing "idol" Rafael Nadal when the Spanish superstars clash for the final time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal, the winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, announced last week that he will retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, however, the 38-year-old will take on Alcaraz for a place in the final of the "Six Kings Slam" exhibition event in Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Since I started to play tennis, I'm watching his matches. I look up to him and I grew up watching him. He was my idol, he is still my idol," Alcaraz said on court after defeating Holger Rune 6-4, 6-2 to set-up an emotional meeting with Nadal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A really important person for my life, for my career and he was one of the reasons that I wanted to become a professional tennis player. Knowing he is going to retire is pretty tough for everyone, for me."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz, the reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion, added: "I will try to enjoy sharing the court with him once again, but I think it is really difficult for everyone."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal and Alcaraz have met three times on the main ATP Tour with the soon-to-be retired veteran holding a 2-1 advantage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spanish pair played doubles together at the Paris Olympics this year and they are expected to team-up again at the Davis Cup Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal also made his last singles appearance at the Games on the same Roland Garros courts where he won 14 French Open titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His Olympic singles campaign was ended by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Thursday's other semi-final in Riyadh sees Djokovic tackle Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number one Sinner eased past Daniil Medvedev 6-0, 6-3 on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The semi-final against Novak will be a different match than the ones we played in the past," said Sinner who defeated the 24-time Grand Slam title winner in the Shanghai Masters final last Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We know each other quite well and we know what to expect from each other," the 23-year-old added. "I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I am just trying to play the best possible tennis, and we will see how it goes." (AFP)

    Pogba 'willing to give up money' to stay at Juventus

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Paul Pogba is adamant that he wishes to return from his reduced doping ban with Juventus even if it means accepting a pay cut, the French World Cup winner told La Gazzetta dello Sport in an interview Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm willing to give up money to be able to play again with Juve, I want to come back with this club," said Pogba in an interview published on the Italian sports daily's website. "The reality is that I am a Juve player and I am preparing to play for Juve."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba's contract with the Italian giants expires in June 2026 and is currently worth US$8.6 million a year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his ongoing suspension, the midfielder receives only the minimum salary stipulated in the Serie A collective agreement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, since Pogba's ban was reduced, Italian press have reported that Juventus are nonetheless seeking to terminate his contract.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will be a new Pogba, a hungrier, wiser and stronger one – I just want to play football," added the former Manchester United star.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to be ready to train and play for Juve, I'm a Juve player," he added. "In my mind, that's all there is at the moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba had his four-year ban for doping reduced to 18 months earlier in October by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and can return to action from March 11 next year, four days before his 32nd birthday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba tested positive for testosterone in August 2023 after a match between Juventus and Udinese in Italy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was provisionally suspended in September of the same year, and then banned for four years by the Italian National Anti-Doping Tribunal the following February.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba's representatives said the testosterone came from a food supplement prescribed by a doctor he consulted in the United States. (AFP)

   British singer Liam Payne, a former member of the group One Direction, died on Wednesday aged 31 after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Argentina, police in Buenos Aires said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Liam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Palermo," a police statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boy band sensation One Direction emerged in 2010 when then-teenagers Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik appeared on the British television contest "The X Factor."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2016, the group announced it was going on an indefinite hiatus, but not splitting up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Payne announced he was working on a solo album that same year, following in the footsteps of other band members. (AFP)

   US stocks bounced back on Wednesday after retreating a day prior, while earnings season was off to a relatively positive start.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones gained 0.8 percent to 43,077, while the S&P 500 Index added 0.5 percent to 5,842.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq advanced 0.3 percent, closing at 18,367.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks picked up towards the end of the day as investors sought to "buy the dip," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, the nuclear stocks are going crazy on the Amazon announcement," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tech giant Amazon announced significant investments in nuclear energy on Wednesday, joining other major companies in aiming to meet the high electric power demands of artificial intelligence using atomic energy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its shares closed 0.4 percent lower.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among companies that reported financial results this week, Morgan Stanley beat estimates with its third quarter report on Wednesday – after quarterly results from Goldman Sachs showed a jump in profits a day earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick said the bank saw a "strong third quarter in a constructive environment," and its shares closed 6.5 percent up.

   <br/>
   There is "not a lot of conviction after yesterday's chipmaker-led declines," noted Briefing.com on Wednesday.

   Dutch tech giant ASML saw its shares plunge after it unveiled a cut to its 2025 guidance and slump in sales bookings, sending share prices of other firms falling on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Nvidia recovered some ground on Wednesday, with its shares up 3.1 percent, ASML and AMD both logged declines still. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland authorities on Wednesday further relaxed visa rules for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents, allowing for more people to apply for multiple-entry visas that allow individual visits of up to six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Back in July, mainland authorities announced a five-year card for non-Chinese permanent Hong Kong residents, allowing them to travel to the mainland. The card allows stays of up to 90 days and use of the speedier e-gates at immigration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said that with immediate effect, both permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong who are non-Chinese can apply for the visas of up to five years, with each trip lasting a maximum 180 days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[This is] to facilitate personnel exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, [and] support Hong Kong’s integration into the overall development of the country," the office said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said that this applies to applicants going to the mainland for business, travel, visiting family members, as well as cultural and academic exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Applicants will not need to submit a receipt for return transport tickets and hotel bookings. They also will not have to get their fingerprints recorded again if they underwent the procedure during a previous visa application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The office added that the new policy does not apply to foreign domestic workers.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday proposed closer three-way ties with Russia and Mongolia at a meeting with counterparts from the neighbouring countries on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said the nation is willing to make contributions to the development and revitalisation of the two countries and the prosperity and stability of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told Mishustin that China was willing to strengthen trade and energy ties with Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li added that enhancing cooperation and promoting deeper and practical trilateral cooperation with Russia and Mongolia would better benefit the people of the three countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mongolia is not a member of the SCO, having chosen instead to be an observer state since 2004. The landlocked nation is on the planned route of a major pipeline that Russia wants to build to carry 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year from its Yamal region to China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Eurasian leaders have gathered in the Pakistani capital Islamabad for the SCO summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing the event, Li said the SCO is an important platform for safeguarding regional peace and stability and promoting the development and prosperity of all countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his opening remarks, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the expansion of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan economic corridor, which is in its second phase and the international north south transport corridor, should be expanded focusing on developing road, rail and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan in nearly a decade with ties between the nuclear-armed rival neighbours continuing to be frosty. (Agencies)

   Russia has captured two more villages in different parts of eastern Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Wednesday, as Russian forces continue their steady advance in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moscow has been claiming gains in Ukraine's embattled east regularly since the summer, advancing towards the city of Pokrovsk, from where thousands have fled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its defence ministry said troops had captured the village of Krasnyi Yar, south of the town of Myrnograd, which lies close to Pokrovsk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine has rushed evacuations of tens of thousands of people from Pokrovsk and Myrnograd as Russian troops advance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Further north, Moscow also said it had captured the village of Nevske, which lies in the Lugansk region, near the border with the Donetsk region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It published images of a village with one main road, lined with heavily destroyed houses, and a Russian soldier flying Moscow's flag through a window of a badly damaged house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The aerial footage showed the small village to be almost entirely destroyed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moscow made the claims as Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky presented his vision of how to end two years of fighting to parliament in Kyiv.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In it, he rejected any territorial concessions and urged for ramped-up Western backing, including an invitation to join Nato. (AFP)

    Principal moratorium will help SMEs: chamber

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday welcomed the measures unveiled in the Policy Address to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think most important to note is that the proposal to revive the mortgage moratorium, to allow the SMEs to repay the interest rather than the capital for the month borrowed for the mortgage," the chamber's CEO Patrick Yeung told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think it's a way to help them to address the current financial challenges."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his policy blueprint that SMEs can apply for a principal moratorium for up to 12 months to ease their cash-flow pressure, if they borrow money under government-backed loan schemes. Authorities will also offer partial principal repayment options.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On government plans to kick-start the city's low-altitude economy by exploring the use of aerial technology, such as drones, Yeung said officials need to overcome technical challenges if they are to make use of low-altitude airspace for economic activity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to look into the infrastructure, then where will be the good place to put up a space, and where to put up charging facilities, et cetera," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So, it's a good idea, but definitely not an easy one to tackle with all those technical challenges possible facing this low-altitude economy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government will set up a cross-departmental task force led by the deputy financial secretary to explore the use of technologies at the airspace within an altitude of up to 1,000 metres.

    'Liquor duty cut won't have big effect on prices'
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The wine and spirits industry on Wednesday said Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits won't have a huge effect on the sector, or the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong General Chamber of Wine and Spirits welcomed the move, but said the change will only be noticed when it comes to luxury products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think it's not easy for the industry, also for the catering sector to slash prices at this moment. I think it only benefits those expensive items, for example, [those with a] retail price of over HK$1,000," Raymond Luk, who chairs the chamber's economic policy and social affairs committee, told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eric Man, general manager at Wai Shing Wine and Spirits, said only around 20 percent of customers buy spirits that are priced over HK$1,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We originally hoped that citizens would be able to use around HK$500 to HK$800 to buy and enjoy liquor of better quality. But the policy now... consumers will still have to increase their budget to get better spirits, it is hard to tell whether they will be willing to do that," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Man said he would like to see the HK$200 threshold for the duty cut reduced by half, so more kinds of liquor would be covered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Luk added that such a move would increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong's liquor market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For the current rates under the new policy, we are still the highest in East Asia. But in the long term, I think it's possible that we'll gain an increased appeal as a high-end spirit destination due to the reduction in taxes, as well as the speeding up of the development of activities related to high-end prestige spirits like trading, distribution and auctions," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said officials moved to slash the tax on hard liquor because they saw market opportunities similar to the ones that followed after the duty on wine was abolished in 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a press conference, Lee said officials made the decision considering that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the objective was to boost the trade in high-end liquor and hoped it would have a similar effect to the abolition of wine duties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee noted the import and re-export value of red wine last year rose by 375 percent compared to 2007, the year before the product became tax free in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Over one year after wine duty has been reduced, we saw an increase of about 350 operators of wine, and an increase of about 1,000 jobs. The income for that sector increased by about 35 percent," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee stressed the government isn't encouraging people to drink, saying it has struck a balance between public health and the need to develop the hard liquor market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Licensed Bar and Club Association, meanwhile, said that though bar operators support the tax cut, it might not bring immediate benefits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association's founding president, Ben Leung, said he thinks the measures can boost Hong Kong's competitiveness in the global liquor market in the long run, because more brands and different types of spirits would enter the local market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But bars cannot benefit immediately because above them [in the chain], there are importers and agents, they themselves might need some time to digest [the news] and make adjustments. They might not have room to lower prices immediately," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leung also called on the Chief Executive to review how to better promote the local night economy, saying that would "expand the room for survival" for small to medium enterprises.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israeli strikes have killed at least 15 people in the southern Lebanese town of Qana while the Israeli military attacked Beirut's southern suburbs early on Wednesday for the first time in nearly a week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes in Qana late on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lebanon's Civil Defence said 15 bodies had been recovered from the rubble of a building and that rescue efforts were still underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the strikes on southern Beirut were the first in six days, and came after Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the United States had given him assurances that Israel would curb its strikes on the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate word on casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah has a strong presence in southern Beirut, known as the Dahiyeh, which is also a residential and commercial area home to large numbers of civilians and people unaffiliated with the militant group.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military said it targeted an arms warehouse under a residential building.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It posted an evacuation warning on the X platform ahead of the strike, saying it was targeting a building in the Haret Hreik neighbourhood.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A year of low-level fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border escalated into all-out war last month , and has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 2,300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since last October, more than three-quarters of them in the past month, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. (AP)

  <img alt="A concern group says the government needs to think of ways to settle affected residents.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Reactions to the government’s plan to eradicate poor quality subdivided units (SDUs) were largely supportive, although there were also calls for the administration to ensure adequate follow-up actions to support affected tenants during the transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The proposed new laws require each unit to be at least eight square metres, or 86 square feet in size and have its own toilet and windows.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A concern group said it estimates that 20 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units would be affected under the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kenny Ng from the Concerning Grassroot Housing Rights Alliance called on the government to come up with ways to make sure affected tenants had a place to live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The government didn't mention how to relocate those residents who are living in subdivided flats who will be affected under this scheme."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Will they be arranged to some other housing for their relocation, or will they just let them rent other private housing themselves? If so, I think those deprived groups will rent some other subdivided flats which will be illegal,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng said the government could consider using unused public housing or transitional housing units to settle affected residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, an NGO that connects deprived groups with landlords said the government should establish a clear timeline for when the law will be in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lai Kin-kwok from the ComHome Social Housing Platform also called for more detailed criteria regarding the minimum living standards for subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can't find the timeline, especially when the law will be established and then how long the grace period is."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think from the information now, we don't know whether the windows can be opened or not... And regarding the eight square metres, I think that's the minimum standard, but it depends on how many residents are inside the eight square metres,” Lai said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He anticipated that landlords of subdivided flats not affected by the proposed laws would consider increasing rents, saying he was disappointed the Policy Address did not address the need for a rent cap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sources said a two-month consultation will take place in December, with the aim of submitting related legislative proposals to Legco next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in a media briefing after the Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said it would take a few years to root out the problem.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First of all, we'll have to pass the legislation, which I think the earliest will probably be next year. Then, we will introduce the registration period. My suggestion is either 12 months or 18 months," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then we'll introduce the tolerance period for adjustments, structurally, to be made. That may be one year, two years, again subject to discussion by Legco."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the sources, penalties for landlords who fail to make improvements after the grace period would include possible imprisonment and fines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But for a subdivided tenant surnamed Au, the law enforcement actions might not pose a deterrent effect to her landlord.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She pays a monthly rent of HK$2,500 for 20-square-foot room with no individual toilet and kitchen, a space that falls in the sub-standard SDU category.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In this flat, if they combine two rooms and provide more than 90 [square] feet, I’m fine. They have a window, I’m fine. I don’t mind if there is no air conditioning. But I think my landlord will not change, he'll just pay the penalty without doing anything if the government penalises him,” Au said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The environment I have now, if I have to be honest, what difference is there from sleeping on the streets? It’s bad that there is no air con on the streets and dust and dirt is emitted from cars, but at least you feel more comfortable and have more space,” she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Au said she had doubts about whether the government could carry out its plan successfully and would stay in her unit until she gets allocated public housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow. Like if tomorrow I buy a lottery ticket, I don’t know if I will win,” she said.

    Property sector welcomes mortgage rules relaxation

  <img alt="The property sector is happy about the relaxation of mortgage restrictions, saying it will boost the property market and overall economy. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774800_1_20241016155146.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The property sector on Wednesday welcomed the government's move to ease mortgage restrictions, saying it will significantly boost the property market and the overall economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee announced that the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for homes will be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) will be raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hannah Jeong, from real estate services firm CBRE, said she thinks the relaxation will boost transaction volumes, especially in the luxury market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This will give a better liquidity for the homebuyers, the people who are looking for the upgrading demand, or they want to enter the market [for the] first time given the good discount offering from the developers. And their down payment amount has been reduced by utilising this LTV ratio increase," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So this improvement will affect, in a possible way, the luxury residential [market] more, because previously it was only 60 percent."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joseph Tsang, chairman of real estate services company JLL, said the LTV move will boost transaction volumes for new residential projects, but it won't be strong enough to reverse the downward trend in housing prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The future trend of Hong Kong housing prices will largely depend on the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures introduced by the mainland government," he wrote in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Real estate and construction sector lawmaker Louis Loong also welcomed the changes, adding that he is happy to see the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit back to pre-2009 levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This sends a very positive message to the entire property market. We have always told the government that a weak property market is not beneficial for Hong Kong's overall economy," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe this will have a very positive effect on Hong Kong's entire property market and even on the economy as a whole."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, the founder and chief executive of Centaline Property Group, Shih Wing-ching, said some remained concerned about potential declines in property values despite the relaxation in mortgage rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What now worries people is no longer the difficulty to get a mortgage loan. People worry about the risk of further declines in property value. So quite a lot of people now choose to rent rather to purchase. If they choose to rent, the relaxation of this ratio could not do them any good," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This policy of course can help a little bit, but the property market is more complex. You need to also look at interest rates, supply and demand. The problem now is that people have not really established their faith in the future, so they are not willing to commit too much at this moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shih added the move alone is not enough to boost developers' appetite for land because it also depends on improvements in transaction volumes and inventory levels in the primary market.

    Govt to subsidise care-home spots in Guangdong

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government is launching a new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in care homes in Guangdong, while it will also expand an existing subsidy programme to include more facilities in the province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address that a three-year pilot programme will allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The existing Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong, meanwhile, will be expanded, with seven more residential homes joining the programme in November 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is also providing more help to needy elderly people who want to remain in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said there will be a 20-percent increase in the number of vouchers given out to elderly people in need of care, but are still waiting for a subsidised spot in a home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six-thousand vouchers will be given out to allow beneficiaries to be admitted to homes of their choice without the need to wait further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also announced other poverty-alleviation measures in his Policy Address, including more than doubling the number of schools offering after-school care services for primary students to allow their parents to work; and expanding its existing “Strive and Rise” programme, where underprivileged children are matched up with mentors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The School-based After-School Care Service Scheme will increase from 50 to over 110 schools, Lee said, and more schools will be encouraged to join, such that there’s no planned cap to the number of students who can benefit from the programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An additional 100 day child care services will be provided at new child care centre, and service places under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project will be increased by 25 percent, to 2,500.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that the government will step up its support for young people hoping to buy subsidised flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He announced in his Policy Address that the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40, to increase their chances of getting an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that starting from the next White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) exercise, the quota for those flats will increase by 1,500 -- all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants under the age of 40.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in a bid to encourage more public housing tenants to buy Home Ownership Scheme units, the government said it will revise the allocation between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants from its current ratio of 4:6 to 5:5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, as part of efforts to crack down on tenancy abuse, the Housing Authority will launch the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" in January next year, offering rewards to anyone providing intelligence that helps to identify such cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also said the government hopes to cut the average waiting time for public rental housing from the current 5.5 years to 4.5 years in 2026-27.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The principal moratorium scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be relaunched as part of efforts to help businesses as Hong Kong undergoes economic restructuring.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said in his Policy Address on Wednesday that firms will be allowed to apply for principal moratorium for up to 12 months under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The maximum loan guarantee periods of the 80 percent and 90 percent guarantee products will be extended to 10 years and eight years respectively, while the partial principal repayment options will be offered to new loans under the two guarantee products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the other measures to support SMEs include a HK$1 billion injection into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales to help them upgrade their operations and develop new markets, as well as fresh efforts to further promote Hong Kong brands.

    Loan-to-value ratio for mortgages to be relaxed: CE

  <img alt="The loan-to-value ratio will be relaxed to 70 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774730_1_20241016122657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   In a bid to encourage more people to purchase a home and to stimulate the city's property market, Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government would relax the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of mortgage loans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This would allow people to borrow more against the value of a property they want to buy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outlining the proposal in his Policy Address, Lee said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would adjust the maximum LTV ratio for homes to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) would be adjusted to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For non-residential properties, the maximum LTV ratio and the maximum DSR would be adjusted to the same levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The HKMA said the adjustments apply to provisional sale and purchase agreements signed from Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Taking into account the latest market developments, the HKMA has decided to adjust the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans and revert the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced," HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even with these adjustments announced today, the Hong Kong banking sector has ample buffers to cope with any challenges from a sharp correction in property prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I would like to remind the public that buying a property is a long-term financial commitment. Prospective buyers should carefully assess the risks involved and their ability to afford a property."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also announced that the government will relax a policy granting residency to people who invest a minimum of HK$30 million in different forms of assets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starting from Wednesday, purchases of property worth HK$50 million or more will be counted as fulfilling a third of the requirement for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme. The amount of real estate investment to be counted towards the total capital investment is capped at $10 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a TV forum, Lee brushed off concerns that the relaxation could lead to an overheating of property prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because their investment will not affect the willingness of our citizens to buy houses. We only allow them [investors] to buy properties valued over HK$50 million," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Right now, the property market is starting to stabilise. We are not worried that will result in any negative impact. I think that will attract more investment while benefiting the growth of our real estate market."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government is working on a series of measures to enhance Hong Kong's status as a cultural, sports and tourism magnet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address, Lee said the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) will release a blueprint later this year on promoting Chinese culture, the development of arts and culture with an international perspective, fostering arts and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world, and driving industry development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency is incubating cultural and creative projects with a potential for industrialisation and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and leveraging market resources to help the sector explore business opportunities, the CE said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turning to the West Kowloon Cultural District, Lee said the authority running the arts hub will take a leading role in building Hong Kong's strengths in arts trading and the restoration and exhibition of high-end private art collections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the authority will promote the district as a prime destination for major international cultural events, while also curating arts programmes and exhibitions to be staged on the mainland and overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the government will continue to foster sports development by enhancing the development of athletes and coaches, and promoting sports in the community by providing more facilities, including a swimming complex suitable for international competitions and a sports arena with fencing facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government will develop a "host city economy" in the sports industry, so local athletes can compete in international events on home soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE noted that Kai Tak Sports Park will open in the first quarter of next year and said the site will "boost sports development and inject impetus into related industries such as recreation, entertainment and tourism and also mega-event economy".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On tourism, Lee said the government will develop Hong Kong into a premier destination through innovative thinking and by making better use of rich and unique resources such as Victoria Harbour, the outlying islands, rural areas, cultures, cuisine, lifestyles and historic buildings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These elements, combined with our edges in technology, animation and comics, the performing arts, film and television culture and more will help to instil the concept of 'tourism is everywhere'", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CSTB will publish a blueprint for the tourism industry later this year, which among other things will cover developing eco-tourism such as "island-hopping tours", and attracting tourists from the Middle East and Asean members with measures such as information in Arabic at the airport, a list of halal restaurants, and encouraging hotels to provide worship facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other plans include the promotion of "yacht tourism", "panda tourism", "horse-racing tourism" and a gourmet guide covering all 18 districts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A working group led by the chief secretary is also going to be set up to identify and develop tourist hotspots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said Beijing is studying SAR government proposals to enhance visas for visitors from the mainland, including the resumption of a multiple-entry arrangement for Shenzhen residents, while the criteria for multiple-entry visas will be relaxed for people from Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

    Govt to improve standards of subdivided units

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The chief executive said in his Policy Address on Wednesday the government would introduce legislation for a system to govern the renting of subdivided flats, with the goal of helping people improve their conditions by insisting on standards that ensure the health and safety of those that live in these types of units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sub-divided units (SDUs) which meet the required living standards would be named as Basic Housing Units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   John Lee said the government would propose the standards of Basic Housing Units should include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said current SDUs differ significantly in standards and it was necessary to set a minimum standard to eradicate subdivided flats which are not fit to live in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under appropriate regulation, the market demand for SDUs would be satisfied by introducing these revamped Basic Housing Units which meet the required standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SDUs that are of poor quality must be converted into Basic Housing Units that meet the required standards. Upon conversion, certified professionals must give their approval to ensure the conversion meets the minimum standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Owners who continue to rent out substandard SDUs under the new system would be held criminally liable, while tenants would not be held liable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the government would allow time for owners of existing SDUs to carry out the necessary renovation works to meet the new standards. A grace period would be implemented during which enforcement action would not be taken against the illegal renting of subdivided flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Secretary for Housing would be empowered by law to decide, upon expiry of the grace period, when to take enforcement action against sub-standard SDUs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The deputy financial secretary and secretary for housing would announce further details and seek the views of Legco and other stakeholders for drawing up the legislative proposals and related measures.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Aaron Judge smacked his first home run of the Major League Baseball playoffs and the New York Yankees beat Cleveland 6-3 on Tuesday, seizing command of the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge broke open a tight game with his two-run blast in the seventh inning as the Yankees grabbed a 2-0 lead in the best-of seven series, which continues on Thursday in Cleveland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got to keep things the same," Judge said. "It's going to be a loud environment, a fun environment. We've got to go out there and keep playing our game – feed off the energy and go from there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The series winner advances to the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees slugger Judge, whose 58 regular-season homers led MLB, crushed a blast over the centerfield wall to give New York a 6-2 lead with his 14th career playoff homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was good to add two more runs there," Judge said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians stranded 11 base runners as four Yankees relief pitchers baffled Cleveland after starter Gerrit Cole went only 4 1/3 innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These guys came in, they're healthy, they're feeling great, some great performances from quite a few guys at the back end," Judge said of New York's relievers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are seeking their first trip to the World Series since winning it for the record 27th time in 2009, while Cleveland has not reached the event since 2016 and last won a World Series in 1948. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Swedish prosecutor on Tuesday said – without mentioning Kylian Mbappé – that a rape investigation had been opened, after media reported that the Real Madrid and France star was the suspect during a visit to Stockholm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to media reports about a suspected rape in Stockholm, the prosecutor can confirm that a criminal report has been submitted to the police," Sweden's Prosecution Authority said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that the alleged incident occurred at a hotel on October 10, but did not name a suspect and said no further information could be shared for the moment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Swedish newspapers Aftonbladet and Expressen, as well as public broadcaster SVT, on Tuesday reported that 25-year-old Mbappé was the target of the investigation, following his two-day visit to the Swedish capital last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The French international visited Stockholm with a group of people last Thursday, as he was not selected for his country's latest round of Nations League matches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to Aftonbladet, the group dined at a restaurant before going to a nightclub, and left Sweden last Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said the complaint was filed last Saturday after the alleged victim had sought medical attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expressen reported on Tuesday that police had seized some clothing as evidence, saying it consisted of women's underwear, a pair of black trousers and a black top.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, citing anonymous sources, Expressen identified Mbappé as the suspect, while Aftonbladet and SVT said on Tuesday they had also had obtained information confirming Mbappe was the suspect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Mbappé on Monday posted on X that there was a link between the Aftonbladet report and his hearing before a French league committee on Tuesday, in his dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain over what he says are unpaid wages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "FAKE NEWS !!!!. It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance," Mbappé said in the post.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mbappé claims he is owed US$60 million by the Qatari-owned French champions. (AFP)

  <img alt="John Lee has outlined proposals to attract more overseas students to study in tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774725_1_20241016122037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to develop Hong Kong into an international tertiary education hub in his Policy Address with various measures such as creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government will encourage local post-secondary institutions to enhance collaboration with their counterparts around the world in promoting the "Study in Hong Kong" brand on a global scale, with an aim to attract more overseas students to study here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added Hong Kong will strive to host international education conferences and exhibitions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also announced the setting up of the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies from the 2025/26 academic year, offering scholarships each year to up to 1,200 local students enrolling in designated postgraduate programmes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a projected shortage of 180,000 workers across different sectors in Hong Kong in the next five years, Lee said the government will reform its talent admission schemes to try to attract more staff from overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It'll add 13 top mainland and overseas universities to the list of institutions under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, raising the total to 198, and the validity period of the first visa of high-income talent will be extended from two to three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the other measures is the introduction of a new mechanism under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, inviting top talent to come here for development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government will set up a new committee – the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents – to coordinate the integrated development of those fields. It'll be led by the chief secretary.

    Harris mocks Trump after rally turns into dance-a-thon

  <img alt="On Monday two medical emergencies in the crowd turned into a bizarre 39 minutes of music and dancing as Donald Trump played nine of his favourite songs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774708_1_20241016120547.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kamala Harris went after her US presidential election rival Donald Trump's mental state and fitness for office on Tuesday after the 78-year-old Republican's televised town hall veered into a surreal, impromptu music session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three weeks ahead of the US election, Harris's campaign has begun to focus aggressively on Trump's health and mental stability, and was quick to weigh in, saying the ex-president appeared "lost, confused, and frozen on stage."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For about half an hour, Monday's event in Oaks near Philadelphia was standard fare ahead of the November 5 election, as Trump took friendly questions from supporters on the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a pause for two medical emergencies in the crowd turned into a bizarre 39 minutes of music and dancing as Trump abandoned the discussion of the election to put on his favourite hits, swaying awkwardly on stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?" he said, bringing the Q&A section to an abrupt end and telling his people to crank up the volume.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has made a brief, jerky dance his signature at the end of rallies for years, nearly always to his exit song – the Village People's 1978 disco anthem "YMCA."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, however, he stayed on stage for nine songs, ranging from opera to Guns N' Roses and Elvis, with the ex-president alternating his dance moves with standing in place and staring into the crowd.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hope he's okay," Harris opined dryly on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Undeterred, Trump was bopping to the Village People again on Tuesday at a rally in Atlanta, where he turned up 90 minutes late and didn't mention the previous night's events or the criticism.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Delivering his usual stump speech focusing on illegal immigration, Trump pushed his now-customary falsehoods and exaggerations about migrant crime in Colorado and Ohio and referred to the country as "occupied" by foreign criminals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But if he was trying to draw a line under Monday's strangeness, he didn't succeed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump called the two world wars "beautiful" and claimed to have invented the word "caravan." Explaining how he was going to make America great again, he lurched into an aside about his wealthy friends, beachwear and President Joe Biden.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have a lot of rich friends. They go here. They go there. They're boring as hell," he began, apropos of nothing in particular. "Nobody cares. They put on their bathing suit. They don't look a lot better than Biden."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris and Trump are locked in a dead heat, according to polls, and the election is set to be decided by seven swing states where the margins could come down to a few thousand votes each.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Republican is the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate that sparked fears about his own age.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has not released a recent comprehensive report on his state of health, prompting fierce criticism from Harris, 59, who has increasingly been homing in on Trump's age and physical and mental condition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the topic of her closing argument as she sat down with popular radio host Charlamagne tha God in an effort to boost her messaging to black male voters – a part of the electorate where Trump has made gains.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After setting out her policies for improving the lives of African American men, she turned to Trump's rallies and repeated a claim that riled him during their September debate – that bored supporters were leaving his rallies early.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This man is weak and he is unfit," Harris said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump had begun the day with a less freewheeling tone at an Economic Club of Chicago event, where he said he was for slapping "obnoxious" tariffs on trading partners like Mexico so that companies move factories to the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff," Trump said. (AFP)

    Hong Kong cuts duty on hard liquor

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Duty on spirits has been reduced to help promote the liquor trade, Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government has made reference to the successful experience of driving the wine trade through exemption of wine duty and will, starting today, reduce the duty rate for liquor with an import price of over HK$200 from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move applies to liquor with an alcoholic strength of more than 30 percent, and the duty on spirits with an import price of HK$200 or below remains unchanged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In recent months, industry representatives had called for a reduction in the duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the cut will boost the development of high value added industries including tourism and logistics and storage, as well as high-end food and beverage consumption.

    Govt sets sights on developing low-altitude economy

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government is looking to kick-start Hong Kong’s low-altitude economy by launching a new working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services from transporting goods and people, to assisting in rescue work and providing high-resolution surveys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said “formulating a management system for low-altitude economy will help drive development in areas such as telecommunication technologies, AI and the digital industry, unlocking the low-altitude airspace as a new production factor for our economy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group will be led by the deputy financial secretary and focus on kick-starting projects with good prospects, as well as develop broader strategies and action plans, and work out regulatory issues and infrastructure needs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will be tasked with launching pilot projects to explore the best applications – including drones for delivery, surveys, building maintenance, aerial photography, performances as well as for search and rescue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many mainland cities have been working to develop low-altitude economies – encompassing services like delivery drones or flying taxis and other aerial vehicles within airspace below 1,000 metres – and Hong Kong has been under pressure to keep up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another group led by the deputy chief secretary will bring various government departments together, and leverage community efforts to identify and develop “tourist hotspots of high popularity and with strong appeal in various districts”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two other groups will focus on promoting the “integrated development” of education, technology and talents, and accelerate the development of the “silver industry” to help meet the daily needs of the elderly.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee started his third Policy Address on Wednesday morning with a call to embrace change, noting Beijing’s support for Hong Kong’s development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sporting a green tie designed by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University showcasing Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, Lee opened his speech at the Legislative Council by noting the resolution adopted at the third plenum of the Communist Party in July to further deepen reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Resolution calls on Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ while consolidating and enhancing its status aas an international hub for high-calibre talents, to exert a greater role in our country’s opening up to the world, and to deepen collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area through better harmonisation of rules and mechanisms,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said from the time he was running for the top job, he has been emphasising the need to embrace reform, and had put in place a series of measures to tackle issues such as enhancing district services, cutting waiting times for public housing, and addressing intergenerational poverty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe that we must maintain our development momentum and self-renewal, and that we must embrace changes while staying principled, innovative and flexible in meeting challenges and opportunities.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE had earlier said his latest policy blueprint will focus on lifting the economy and on livelihood issues. The official theme for the address is “Reform for Enhancing Development and Building Our Future Together.”

   President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States. This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world," Xi said in remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National Committee on US-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi pointed out that China-US relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world, which have a bearing on the future and destiny of mankind, according to the letter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China has always handled China-US relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and has always believed that the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other," Xi said. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's government warned on Wednesday against "escalation" on the Korean peninsula, after North Korea blew up sections of deeply symbolic roads and railways connecting it to the South.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These North Korean activities could increase tensions between the South and the North, and it is important that this does not lead to an escalation," said Kazuhiko Aoki, deputy chief cabinet secretary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The North blew up the roads and railways on Tuesday, Seoul's military said, adding it had conducted a "counter-fire" operation in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pyongyang's military last week vowed to permanently seal its southern border after spending months laying mines and building anti-tank barriers in the wake of leader Kim Jong-un declaring the South his country's "principal enemy".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The North also accused Seoul of using drones to drop anti-regime propaganda leaflets on the capital Pyongyang, with Kim convening a security meeting to direct a plan of "immediate military action" in response, state media reported Tuesday.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former US president Donald Trump's cryptocurrency platform had a faltering sales launch on Tuesday, with only a fraction of its digital tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Republican candidate announced in mid-September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch the platform named World Liberty Financial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 billion digital tokens, priced at 1.5 cents each, were offered by the company – a total value of US$300 million – but just three percent had been purchased by Tuesday evening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tokens can be used as cryptocurrencies and give buyers a vote on the platform's governance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many observers blamed the low sales on technical problems, as the company's website suffered outages earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World Liberty Financial will enable users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies to or from one another, a service already offered by many platforms, one of the best-known of which is Aave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, presenting himself as a "pro-bitcoin president" if elected in November. (AFP)

    Tuchel set to be unveiled as new England manager

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Thomas Tuchel is set to be named England's new manager after agreeing a deal with the Football Association (FA), multiple British and German media outlets reported on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Times, Sky Sports, the BBC and German newspaper Bild said that Tuchel, 51, will be named as the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee Carsley was put in temporary charge of England in August following Southgate's resignation shortly after losing the final of Euro 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The FA declined to comment on the reports but said that CEO Mark Bullingham will provide an update on Wednesday at Wembley Stadium when the appointment is expected to be confirmed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The German, who has been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season, would become just the third foreign manager of the Three Lions after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Germany reported he will sign an 18-month deal from January 1, 2025 until the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former coach of Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern, Tuchel has the trophy-winning pedigree that the FA is seeking to help end a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the move has drawn criticism over the FA's unwillingness to trust an English coach with its top job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off. (AFP)

    Brady to become part-owner of NFL's Las Vegas Raiders

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady was approved as a member of the Las Vegas Raiders ownership group on Tuesday by NFL team owners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady, who played 23 NFL seasons before retiring in 2022, will hold a 5 percent stake in the Raiders, who are off to a 2-4 start this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval at an owners meeting in Atlanta ends an 18-month saga since the first reports of Brady seeking a share of the partnership group that owns the club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Delays in the deal reportedly included figuring out an exact percentage for Brady and issues around his current role as an NFL television analyst for Fox Sports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two months ago, the NFL put some restrictions on Brady's broadcast access because of his possible involvement with the Raiders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady is banned from attending in-person or online broadcast production meetings and is not allowed access to players, coaches or team facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While he is permitted to broadcast Raiders contests, Brady must follow NFL rules banning criticism of other teams or officials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady, 47, spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, leading them to six NFL titles, and captured his last crown with Tampa Bay in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He set NFL career records with 7,753 completions from 12,050 attempts for 89,214 yards and 649 touchdowns. (AFP)
