<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman has been charged with murdering her husband in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday night, and she's due to appear in Kwun Tong Court on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The woman, 32, was arrested after she allegedly slashed her sleeping husband with a fruit knife in their flat at LOHAS Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man, 30, suffered multiple wounds and was certified dead at hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers earlier said they were probing the suspect's motives, noting that she had suffered from depression since giving birth around a year and a half ago.

    'Do more to ease traffic on Shenzhen-Zhongshan link'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector representatives have called on mainland officials to do more to smooth out traffic on the new Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, after commuters experienced much longer journey times than expected amid heavy congestion on its opening day on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new mega-project - which comprises two bridges, two artificial islands, and a tunnel – was supposed to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in a gridlock for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some vehicles stopped on the bridge and people were taking photos. There should have been four lanes available, but when the problem was at its peak, there were only two," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The traffic capacity was reduced by half, leading to traffic congestion. Transport departments and officers could have done better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, pointed out that it took him about five hours to reach Shenzhen from Zhongshan on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes mainland authorities will handle the issue by, for example, banning commuters from taking photos on bridges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will keep an eye on the situation for one or two more weeks. I will also see what happens this coming Saturday and Sunday," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will make decisions on tour group arrangements depending on the traffic situation, especially for those heading to the west side of the Pearl River Delta. I think we'll have to keep things flexible and people on tours should be aware of this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach operator Eternal East Bus, meanwhile, said it anticipates a 30 percent jump in passenger numbers with the opening of the new link, and will increase the frequency of buses to Zhongshan accordingly.

    Non-Chinese HK residents to get mainland travel cards

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Authorities said non-Chinese permanent residents can start applying for the mainland travel permit from July 10. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759771_1_20240701105809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing announced on Monday that non-Chinese Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents can soon apply for mainland travel permits, eliminating their need for visas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Immigration Administration said the move is to facilitate cross-border personnel exchanges, and support the integration of the two SARs into the national development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 10, eligible persons can apply for the permit by visiting a China Travel Service outlet in person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The permit will be valid for five years, and holders can enter the mainland multiple times during the period. They can stay up to 90 days per visit," the administration said in an online announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Permit holders will be able to cross the border through e-channels after having their fingerprints collected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they will not be allowed to work, study or engage in activities such as news gathering on the mainland. Those who intend to do so need to apply separately to relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities hope the new policy will make it more convenient for personnel exchanges in areas such as businesses and investment, cultural and tourism as well as education and research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Hong Kong government welcomed the new policy, saying it will greatly enhance border clearance efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee added that it demonstrates the country's care and support for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents have deep roots in Hong Kong. They have been working diligently and making significant contributions to the development of Hong Kong," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure is not limited to any nationality or industry, which fully highlights Hong Kong's unique status under 'one country, two systems' and greatly helps Hong Kong maintain its international character and diversity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials have been in close communication with their mainland counterparts in facilitating the flow of talent across the border.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 17-year-old Chinese player has died after collapsing on court during an international tournament in Indonesia, badminton officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang Zhijie was taken ill during a match late on Sunday against Japan's Kazuma Kawano at the Asian Junior Badminton Mixed Team Championships in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The score was 11-11 in the first game when Zhang suddenly fell to the floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A doctor and medical team were quickly on the scene and he was taken to hospital by ambulance within minutes, but passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China's Zhang Zhijie, a singles player, collapsed on the court during a match in the evening," Badminton Asia and the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was sent to the hospital where he passed away at 23:20 local time yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was attended to by the tournament doctor and medical team. He was taken in the standby ambulance in less than two minutes and sent to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Badminton Asia, PBSI and the organising committee are immensely saddened and expressed their deepest condolences to Zhang's parents, family, and the Chinese Badminton Association."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The world of badminton has lost a talented player," the statement added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Monday that Beijing is to send two pandas to Hong Kong as gifts, as he led top officials and political heavyweights in attending activities marking the 27th anniversary of SAR Establishment Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At 8am, the CE and more than a hundred guests attended the flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those in attendance were the director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, former Chief Executives Donald Tsang, CY Leung and Carrie Lam, as well as Chief Justice Andrew Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the national and SAR flags were being raised, the guests all stood solemnly facing them while the national anthem was being played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disciplined forces, such as the Government Flying Service and Fire Services Department, gave their salute at Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the brief ceremony outdoors, the guests headed to a reception inside the Convention and Exhibition Centre next door.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the reception speech, the CE announced that Beijing will be sending two pandas to Hong Kong, with the pair being the fifth and sixth pandas to live in Ocean Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I sincerely thank the central government's care and support for the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The officials took up my proposal to send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts. We are immediately starting preparations to receive them in a few months, and they'll bring us joy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said this is just the first of many good news to come for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive also spoke about the work of the SAR government over the past year, including enacting homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law, as well as attracting more skilled workers to come to Hong Kong.

    South Korean factory activity grows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korea's exports have been growing since October. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759748_1_20240701092022.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's factory activity growth quickened in June to the fastest in 26 months, as new orders jumped on improving global demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The purchasing managers index (PMI) for manufacturers in Asia's fourth-largest economy, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 52.0 in June, from 51.6 in May, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the highest reading since April 2022, staying above the 50-mark, which separates expansion from contraction, for a second consecutive month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another strong month of data provides further evidence that global industrial activity and trade are picking up," said Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Viewed as a bellwether for exports due to its integration in supply chains for key intermediate goods like batteries and semiconductors, South Korean manufacturing output and orders often provide leading signals for trends more broadly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New orders expanded at the quickest rate since February 2022 on stronger demand both at home and abroad, with those from overseas increasing the most in five months, sub-indexes showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asian countries including China, Vietnam and Japan, as well as other regions such as North America and Europe were cited in the survey as markets that yielded sales growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's exports, which have been growing since October led by demand for computer chips and from the United States, are recovering towards record-high levels, the finance minister said last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Output rose for a third straight month in June but at a slower rate than the month before. Stocks of finished goods were depleted by the most in nearly three years and backlogs of work rose by the most in almost two years, suggesting that factory capacity was somewhat stretched amid growing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, inflation in input prices accelerated to the fastest in eight months, with companies attributing the rise to unfavourable exchange rate movements and a rise in raw material prices, namely for metals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead dropped to the weakest in six months, as concerns grew that domestic market conditions could hinder factory output despite positive sales forecasts. (Reuters)

    North Korea launches two ballistic missiles

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Last week, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a multiple warhead missile, also this was disputed by the South. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759742_1_20240701085745.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea on Monday launched two ballistic missiles, South Korea's military confirmed -- the latest in a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang that have soured relations with Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A short-range ballistic missile was launched in the early morning hours, the South's military Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. About 10 minutes later, a second missile, this one as yet unidentified, was detected, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our military has strengthened surveillance and vigilance in preparation for further launches," the JCS said, adding it had shared information about the incidents with the United States and Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not offer immediate confirmation of the launches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a multiple warhead missile, but the South said that launch ended in a mid-air explosion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing while bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang says those missives are in retaliation for balloons loaded with anti-regime propaganda leaflets sent northwards by activists in the South.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the North's repeated launches, South Korea has fully suspended a tension-reducing military treaty. It also resumed propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts and live-fire drills near the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea also has grown anxious over the North's warming relations with its isolated neighbour Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea is accused of breaching arms control measures by supplying weapons to Russia to use in its war in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in June in a show of unity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Pyongyang condemned joint military drills by South Korea, Japan and the United States, calling them an "Asian version of Nato" and warning of "fatal consequences".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-day "Freedom Edge" exercises included preparation in ballistic missile and air defences, anti-submarine warfare and defensive cyber training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang has always decried similar combined exercises as rehearsals for an invasion, but Seoul said Sunday the latest exercises were a continuation of defensive drills held regularly for years. (AFP)

 Rodri, Fabian Ruiz, Nico Williams and Dani Olmo all scored as Spain came from behind to beat surprise package Georgia 4-1 at Euro 2024 on Sunday and set up a blockbuster quarter-final against hosts Germany.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Robin Le Normand's own goal gave Georgia a shock lead in the 18th minute of this last-16 tie to send their noisy supporters wild in Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first goal Spain had conceded at the competition but they came back to equalise six minutes before the interval courtesy of Manchester City midfielder Rodri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz then headed home in the 51st minute and Williams ran through for the third before substitute Olmo made sure of the win as La Roja stay on track to become European champions for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain now take on Germany in the last eight in Stuttgart on Friday in a repeat of the Euro 2008 final, which they won 1-0 to begin their golden era of dominance in international football.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luis de la Fuente's current team are looking to bring back the glory days and they were expected to brush Georgia aside here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They would have ultimately won by a far greater margin had they converted more of their chances, with 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal squandering several opportunities in his attempt to become the youngest ever goal-scorer at the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia are ranked 74th in the world, 66 places below Spain. Willy Sagnol's team lost twice to Spain in qualifying, going down 7-1 at home and 3-1 away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet they still qualified for a first major tournament and then made it to the knockout stages with a stunning 2-0 win over Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagnol said on the eve of this match that his unfancied team had "already won the European Championship" thanks to their remarkable run, and they now go home with their heads held high despite eventually crumbling here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have a lively attacking partnership between Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Georges Mikautadze that is a danger for any opponent, and Giorgi Mamardashvili has been one of the best goalkeepers at the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mamardashvili had already saved from Pedri and kept out Dani Carvajal's glancing header before Georgia went ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move started with a fine piece of play by Kvaratskhelia, who had little room to manoeuvre on the left wing but picked out a pass for Mikautadze, who then released Otar Kakabadze on the right wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kakabadze's cross into the box was a horrible one for Le Normand, who had Kvaratskhelia arriving behind him and could not stop the ball rebounding off him and into the net for the eighth own goal of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain were now vulnerable to the counterattack, which is Georgia's strength, but the men in red continued to dominate the game and kept testing Mamardashvili.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Valencia shot-stopper made several more interventions in an increasingly wild encounter before the equaliser finally came, Rodri controlling a Williams pass at the edge of the box and stroking the ball into the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It felt as if that might be that for Georgia, but they remained audacious on the break, with Kvaratskhelia almost scoring from inside his own half at the beginning of the second period, his shot going just wide with goalkeeper Unai Simon out of position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain went ahead shortly after, as Yamal crossed from the right for Ruiz to head in his second goal of the tournament at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal didn't just miss chances of his own, as he also forced an own goal which was disallowed for offside before Georgia fell apart defensively under increasingly heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz released Williams, who ran from inside his own half, skipped past Giorgi Gvelesiani into the box and fired into the roof of the net to make it 3-1 on 75 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A delightful control and finish from the edge of the box by Olmo completed the scoring with seven minutes left. (AFP)

    Bellingham, Kane rescue England from shock Euro exit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jude Bellingham's spectacular bicycle kick saves England's blushes. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759726_1_20240701034625.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England escaped an embarrassing last 16 exit at Euro 2024 thanks to Jude Bellingham's overhead kick before Harry Kane struck in extra-time for a 2-1 win over Slovakia on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Three Lions have been hyped as one of the favourites to end a 58-year wait for major tournament glory but looked set to go out with a whimper to Ivan Schranz's 25th minute goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Bellingham's moment of inspiration five minutes into six added on in stoppage time breathed new life into Gareth Southgate's reign as England boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane then headed in just a minute into extra-time to set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate looked certain to fall on his sword after steadfastly refusing to make changes to a side that stumbled through as winners of Group C despite scoring just two goals in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobbie Mainoo was introduced for his first competitive start in Southgate's only change and he paid the price with another lacklustre display lacking in any speed or invention for long spells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one saving grace of England's performances in the group stage was that a makeshift defence had held up well, conceding just once in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they were torn to pieces early on by a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England did not heed a couple of warnings as David Hancko and Lukas Haraslin were wasteful with big chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia finally punished their more illustrious opponents when David Strelec was given acres of room to turn and play in Schranz, who confidently stroked past Jordan Pickford for his third goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his lack of experience, Mainoo was one of the few players that threatened to spark England into life as the Manchester United midfielder's effort was deflected wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The half-time whistle was met with a chorus of boos but Southgate still stuck to his guns and did not make a change until 25 minutes to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England did at least improve on a dismal first half and had the ball in the net within five minutes of the restart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Foden turned in Kieran Trippier's cross but was caught offside after a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia should have doubled their lead shortly afterwards when England gave away possession and Strelec saw Pickford well off his line but failed to hit the target from the halfway line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate's hand was finally forced on 66 minutes by an injury to Trippier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the major calls the England boss will come to regret is only naming one natural left-back in his 26-man squad in Luke Shaw, who has not played a minute for club or country since February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Shaw not match-fit, Bukayo Saka was forced to deputise at left-back to make room for the introduction of Cole Palmer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's chances seemed to have gone when Kane headed wide a golden opportunity and Declan Rice smashed the post with a long-range pot shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate was even derided by the England support for bringing on Ivan Toney deep into stoppage time with chants of "you don't know what you're doing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, there was an incredible twist as Bellingham acrobatically turned home Guehi's flick-on from a throw-in the final moments of added-on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia were suddenly rattled and Toney was to have a telling contribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brentford striker headed Eberechi Eze's mishit shot back across goal for Kane to power home his second goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia should still have taken the game to penalties when full-back Peter Pekarik failed to turn in a dangerous driven cross from point-blank range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But England live to fight another day come the quarter-final against an impressive Switzerland, who comfortably knocked out holders Italy 2-0 on Saturday. (AFP)

    French far right wins election first round: estimates

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Emmanuel Macron has called for a "broad" alliance against the far right in the second round. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759720_1_20240701022400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's far right won the first round of pivotal legislative elections on Sunday with the centrist forces of President Emmanuel Macron coming in only third behind the left after the highest turnout in over four decades, estimates said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it remained unclear if the far-right National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Penn would win an absolute majority of seats in the new National Assembly lower house in the July 7 second round and allow her to claim claim the post of prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron had stunned the nation and baffled even some allies by calling snap polls after the RN trounced his centrist forces in European Parliament elections this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gamble risks backfiring, with Macron's alliance now expected to win a far smaller minority contingent in parliament, making the president a far less powerful figure for the remaining three years of his term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Projections from prominent French polling firms gave the RN 34.5 percent of the vote, compared to 28.5-29.1 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 20.5-21.5 percent for Macron's centrist camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The polling agencies projected this would give the RN a majority of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after the second round and a possible absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Macron called for a "broad" alliance against the far right in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the French facing their most polarising choices in recent history, turnout soared. The Elabe organisation projecting a final turnout of 67.5 percent, the highest participation in a regular format legislative election in France since 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final turnout in 2022 was just 47.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The July 7 second round will see run-off votes take place in seats where there was no absolute majority, allowing the final composition of the National Assembly to take shape. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two large wildfires were burning on Sunday near Greece's capital of Athens, and authorities sent emergency messages for some residents to evacuate and others to stay at home and close their windows to protect themselves from smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first blaze, southeast of Athens, began in the early afternoon. Local authorities said it burned at least four homes and several cars. No casualties were reported by 6 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blaze was approaching the port of Lavrio about 60 kilometers southeast of Athens. The area has suffered from wildfires in recent years. A small forest to the south, near Cape Sounio, also could be in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second, fast-moving fire later began north of Athens near the suburb of Stamata. It was burning through scrubland and forest and moving up 1,100-metre Mount Penteli, one of four mountains ringing the capital area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 230 firefighters, 17 planes and 12 helicopters were trying to put out both fires, the Fire Service said. The planes and helicopters can only operate in daylight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hot and dry weather, combined with strong winds, are helping spread the fires. Temperatures in the low 30s Celsius are expected to rise on Monday and Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires have become an annual feature in the Mediterranean. Earlier this month, Greece and Turkey saw large fires. (AFP)

 Hundreds of people marched in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Sunday, in tribute to those who died in anti-government demonstrations this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to NGOs, at least 30 people died in protests driven by a government drive to substantially raise taxes in the East African country – although the government has not given any official toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largely peaceful rallies turned violent last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the deeply unpopular tax increases following pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police opened fire on protesters who stormed the parliament complex and a fire broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clashes were unprecedented in the history of the country since its independence from Britain in 1963.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, a few hundred people gathered in Uhuru Park in central Nairobi following an appeal on central media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After singing and lighting candles, they waved Kenyan flags and chanted as they marched past the hospital where some of the injured protesters are being treated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators dispersed peacefully late in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the protests turned deadly on June 25, President William Ruto's administration ultimately withdrew the bill. (AFP)

 Mercedes' George Russell was gifted a win in the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday after a dramatic late collision between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pole sitter Verstappen had to settle for fifth after leading for much of the race while Norris was forced to retire his McLaren after a nip and tuck battle between the pair for the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Piastri in the other McLaren took second with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz completing the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell said: "Incredible, it was a tough fight, starting in third. I was watching on the big screen and knew Lando would try and get that race win, but the team has done a great job to get us in the fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So proud to be back on the top step," added the British driver, who notched up Mercedes' last win in Brazil in 2022. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ferocious storms and torrential rains that lashed France, Switzerland and Italy this weekend have left seven people dead, local authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three people in their 70s and 80s died in France's northeastern Aube region on Saturday when a tree crushed the car they were travelling in during fierce winds, the local authority said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth passenger was in critical care, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Switzerland, four people have died and another is missing, according to local police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three were killed after torrential rains triggered a landslide in the southeast, police in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man was also found dead in a hotel in Saas-Grun in the southwest canton of Valais, police said, adding that he was probably taken by surprise by a sudden rapid rise in floodwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man is also missing in Valais, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The civil security services said "several hundred" people were evacuated in Valais and roads closed after the Rhone and its tributaries overflowed in different locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency services were assessing the best way to evacuate 300 people who had arrived for a football tournament in Peccia, while almost 70 more were being evacuated from a holiday camp in the village of Mogno.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The poor weather was making rescue work particularly difficult, police had said earlier, with several valleys inaccessible and cut off from the electricity network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The federal alert system also said part of the canton was without drinking water.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An official factory survey on Sunday showed manufacturing on the mainland contracting for a second month in June. But the non-manufacturing sector - which includes services and construction - continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official purchasing managers' index, or PMI, is a broad survey of sentiment among factory owners. It came in at 49.5 for June and, although the figure was unchanged from May, a number below the 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI fell to 50.5 from 51.1 in May. The figure, which is the lowest since December, suggests consumers are still cautious, even as the sector grows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts now expect Beijing to roll out more policy support measures in the short term, while a government pledge to boost fiscal stimulus is seen helping kick domestic consumption into a higher gear.

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link officially opens

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Sunday welcomed the opening of a road link that spans the Pearl River Delta and connects Shenzhen with Zhongshan, saying that it helps to promote market integration in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, which opened on Sunday afternoon, is expected to cut the journey time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, traffic jams at both ends of the link marred the first day of operation, and some people complained the journey took much longer than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi said it's necessary to ensure the link is safe and smooth, and that it will help integrate the eastern and western sides of the Pearl River Delta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said he expects it to be a popular tourist spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One out of two enquiries have been asking about the Shenzhen-Zhongshan link for single-day or multi-day tour groups. Customers hope to go to Zhongshan, Shunde or Gudou and spend three days there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man travelling to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong by tour bus said he now expects the journey to be more convenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I travelled to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong before, I had to go via Shenzhen Bay and Humen. It took me five-and-a-half hours. I want to see whether taking the link will cut my journey time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A restaurant manager in Zhongshan said he expects business to increase after the opening of the transport link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong tour groups contribute to half of our sales for group dining. After the opening of the link, many travel agencies, which didn't previously partner with us, also came to our restaurant to have a look at the environment and the food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The link is 24 kilometres in length and consists of two bridges, two artificial islands, and a two-way, eight-lane tunnel.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Five people, including a four-year-old child, were killed in a massive explosion at a pyrotechnics warehouse in the southern Philippines, emergency services said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Saturday afternoon blast at the Zamboanga City site tore a large hole in the ground, sent debris careening into nearby buildings and houses and ignited a blaze, fire investigator Luigi Chan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four warehouse workers and the four-year-old son of one of the staffers were killed, Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city disaster office confirmed the death toll and said another 38 people had been injured in the incident, eight of them seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said they are investigating the cause of the explosion, which created a 20-metre (66-foot) crater, dismantled the depot's walls and rained rubble on a nearby soft drinks factory, a grains and flour warehouse and area homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most probable origin of the fire is the pyrotechnics stored at the warehouse," Chan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the blast radius extended more than 3,000 square metres (0.8 acres) and it took firefighters more than two hours to bring the blaze under control. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive, John Lee, on Sunday said Hong Kong currently has more opportunities than challenges, and the city has to grasp the chance to create more achievements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video marking two years of the current administration, Lee said now is the time for Hong Kong to advance from stability to prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are more opportunities than challenges. Hong Kong society is generally safe and stable now, so it's the best time for development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be innovative while having bottom-line thinking. We have to make timely and appropriate measures according to local conditions when formulating policies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that there were still external challenges, but that Hong Kong would make best use of its advantages.

    Woman arrested after alleged murder at Lohas Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they had arrested a 32-year-old woman on suspicion of murder after her 30-year-old husband was found dead from a knife wound at a flat in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they had received a report about the incident from the suspect's father-in-law at 11.50 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police rushed to the scene and found the man on the sofa with injuries to his neck. He was sent to Tseung Kwan O Hospital in an unconscious state, where he was declared dead just after 12.30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, assistant district commander Tsang Chun-kit said initial enquiries suggested the woman may have been suffering from depression after giving birth to her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to thoroughly investigate her motive. The mental state of the suspect is one of the key areas that our investigation will focus on. This is because the suspect experienced significant depression after giving birth to her son. She had sought regular treatment from a private doctor," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the couple had been married for five years and had no apparent financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that at the time of the incident, their one-and-a-half-year-old son was being taken care of by his paternal grandfather.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, on Sunday said it's time for Hong Kong to take a step forward, after being in a defensive position over the past few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Chan said the city had been safeguarding its financial security and economy since 2019 due to the social unrest and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government is working to boost the economy, despite the presence of external challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the short term, we are holding many mega events and inviting people to visit Hong Kong. We hope to make our city more lively and prosperous. After the pandemic, fewer people are coming here, and Western countries may have misunderstandings about Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But businesses, who have come in recent months, feel positive about Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said some countries had criticised but they had been proved wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some said Hong Kong is no longer a financial centre, and that there was an outflow of capital. But if we look at the data, when they were making these slanders in 2023, we still saw a net capital inflow," he said.

    MTR fare rise of 3.09 percent kicks in

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fares on the MTR rose by 3.09 percent on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The MTR had initially sought 3.2 percent but the government's affordability cap - which is based on the median monthly household income - limited the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase means that an adult passenger using an Octopus card to make the long journey between Tung Chung to Hong Kong Station will have to pay 70 cents more, bringing the total fare to HK$24.3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cushion the initial blow, the rail operator is offering a complimentary ride for passengers who make 10 trips on the rail network between July 1 and July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, this offer is only available to adult passengers who have linked their Octopus cards to the MTR Mobile app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also excludes the Airport Express and Light Rail.

    Police raid offices of Thales in three countries

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759642_1_20240630100527.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French defence group Thales faced fresh questions Saturday after police in three countries searched its offices this week as part of two separate corruption investigations, a judicial source told AFP.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers in France, the Netherlands and Spain carried out the searches between Wednesday and Friday, said the source, confirming a report from French broadcaster BFMTV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police searches were triggered by two separate investigations, the source added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first, opened at the end of 2016, into suspected corruption of a foreign official, criminal association and money laundering involved the sale of submarines and the construction of naval base in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second, opened in June 2023, concerned similar offences linked to the sale of military and civilian equipment abroad, the source added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thales confirms that the searches have taken place," the company told AFP Saturday. "The group is cooperating with the competent authorities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an official visit to Rio de Janeiro in 2008, France's then president Nicolas Sarkozy signed a contract with Brazil for the sale of four Scorpene-class submarines for 5.2 billion euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessels incorporated parts supplied by Thales and three of the submarines have already been delivered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second element of the deal was the construction of a naval base and a submarine construction site at Itaguai, which was inaugurated in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second investigation opened in June 2023, said the judicial source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This case is a collaboration by investigators in France, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as official from Eurojust, the European Union agency for criminal justice cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales, in its response to AFP Saturday evening, stressed that it "strictly conforms to national and international regulations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company had developed and implemented a programme designed to ensure it met the highest industry standards, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales has previously been investigated for alleged corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris investigating magistrate is due to decide shortly whether to follow the recommendations of the prosecutor at the financial crimes office and put a subsidiary of Thales on trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DCNI, part of the group's naval wing, is under investigation over the sale of submarines to Malaysia in 2002.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it emerged in May 2023 that financial prosecutors had also opened a preliminary investigation into how Thales won a contract to refit India's Mirage-2000 fighter jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales has denied any wrongdoing in the affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another investigation, opened in December 2020, is looking at the transfer of a former Thales employee to a key post at the United Nations, one of the defence company's clients. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French people vote on Sunday in high-stakes snap parliamentary elections which could alter France's trajectory and see the far-right party of Marine Le Pen take power in a historic first.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With Russia's war against Ukraine in its third year and energy and food prices much higher, support for the anti-immigration and eurosceptic National Rally (RN) party has surged despite President Emmanuel Macron's pledges to prevent its ascent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polling stations open across mainland France for the first round of elections at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) and close 12 hours later, immediately followed by projections that usually predict the result with a degree of accuracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voters in France's overseas territories that span the globe cast ballots earlier in the weekend. Some 49 million French are eligible to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round, a week later, on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls show that National Rally is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the RN obtains an absolute majority, RN party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense "cohabitation" with Macron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse," Rahman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, thousands of people joined an LGBT Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms," said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has deplored "racism or anti-Semitism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off. The party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!" Le Pen wrote on social media platform X on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Le Pen and Bardella have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a "civil war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins. (AFP)

 Police on Saturday arrested a 55-year-old man after he was allegedly found carrying a bullet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said that at 6 pm, officers had been patrolling Nam Ning Street in Aberdeen, when they saw a man who they believed to be acting suspiciously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said officers stopped and searched the man and a bullet was found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers then arrested the man on suspicion of possessing ammunition without a license.

<div class="itemFullText">
 India beat South Africa by seven runs in a heart-stopping final to win the Twenty20 World Cup at the Kensington Oval on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Electing to bat on a dry surface, 2007 champions India overcame a top-order meltdown to post a competitive 176-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Virat Kohli (76) struck his first 50 of this World Cup and Axar Patel smashed 47 to power India to a healthy total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anrich Nortje and Keshav Maharaj claimed two wickets apiece for South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Proteas suffered a top order collapse of their own but Quinton de Kock (39) and Tristan Stubbs (31) put their chase back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heinrich Klaasen (52) then counter-attacked in spectacular fashion but India's impeccable death-overs bowling restricted South Africa to 169-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, Kohli confirmed that he was quitting T20 Internationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was my last T20 game playing for India," player-of-the-match Kohli said following India's victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Time for the next generation to take the T20 game forward."  (Reuters)

    Switzerland dispatch Italy; Germany beat Denmark

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Italy's Alessandro Bastoni slumps on the pitch after the match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759626_1_20240630022211.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of superb strikes from Remo Freuler and Ruben Vargas for Switzerland sent defending champions Italy crashing out of the European soccer championship in the round of 16 after a sloppy, rudderless display by Luciano Spalletti's side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Though the Swiss defended well, the Italians made their job all the easier with bad passing and poor-decision-making, giving the ball away cheaply in central positions and failing to press with any vigour as they headed for the exit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a slow, tenuous start on a sweltering evening in Berlin, Switzerland should have taken the lead in the 24th minute when Breel Embolo was played in, but his attempt to wait out Gianluigi Donnarumma didn't succeed and the Italian goalkeeper comfortably parried his curled shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking far more like defending champions than the men in blue, the Swiss breakthrough came 13 minutes later with brilliantly-worked goal as they pulled the Italians out of position, Freuler hammering the ball home from a pin-point pass by Vargas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whatever Spalletti said at half-time did not have the desired effect and his side were two down within a minute, with Italy's ponderous, flat-footed defence taking on a spectator's role as Vargas curled a stunning shot into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss almost threw the Italians a lifeline in the 51st minute as Fabian Schaer's glancing header wrong-footed keeper Yann Sommer, leaving him to watch helplessly as the ball bounced up and kissed the far post before being cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the clock ticking ominously, the Italian players seemed paralysed in the face of the Swiss defence, resorting to speculative long shots that did little to trouble Sommer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woodwork intervened again in the 74th minute as Gianluca Scammacca scuffed the ball onto the near post from close range but that was as close as they came, and Italian fans were streaming out of the stands long before the final whistle, with those left in their seats dumbstruck by their team's insipid performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That goal at the start of the second half cut our legs, we weren't very incisive," said Italian coach Spalletti after the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What made the difference is the pace, we had a pace that was too inferior to them in the first half. Even in the individual players there was a different pace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other game, a Kai Havertz penalty and a Jamal Musiala strike gave Germany a 2-0 win over Denmark as the host nation reached the quarter-finals after a dramatic game that was delayed by almost half an hour in the first half due to a violent storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Havertz stroked home from the spot early in the second half in Dortmund following a handball by Joachim Andersen, the unlucky Danish defender who had a goal disallowed at the other end only moments earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musiala, of Bayern Munich, then ran away to stroke in the second goal midway through the second half as Germany's class told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one point it looked as if the game could be abandoned as English referee Michael Oliver stopped play in the 35th minute of the first half and took the teams off the pitch while a violent storm passed overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain, hailstones, high winds, thunder and lightning caused a break in play of 25 minutes before the action could resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It made for a memorable night, and one that ended with the host nation coming through a stern test of their credentials to keep alive their dream of winning the trophy in Berlin on July 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The path is set to get much tougher from here, however, and Julian Nagelsmann's team will now go to Stuttgart for a quarter-final next Friday against either much-fancied Spain or surprise package Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Denmark, who famously beat Germany in the 1992 European Championship final, go home without winning a game. (Reuters, AFP)

    Policeman wounded near Israeli embassy in Belgrade

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Serbian police officer on Saturday killed a man who shot him in the neck with a crossbow in front of the Israeli embassy in Belgrade, in what the prime minister called a "terrorist act".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police identified the assailant as being a "convert" to Islam, who was born in 1999 in the town of Mladenovac, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack happened around 11:00 am (1700 HKT) on Saturday in the Serbian capital, when the attacker shot the officer who was on duty outside the Israeli embassy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policeman "used a weapon in self-defence and defeated the attacker, who died as a result of his injuries", said Interior Minister Ivica Dacic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said some arrests had been made and a number of people known to the security services were suspected of being linked to the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said they were carring out searches in a number of locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer, who underwent surgery in hospital, was in his guard booth when the attack happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to authorities, the assailant had moved to live in Novi Pazar, which is a historical and political centre of the Bosniak Muslim minority in Serbia, and a centre of Islam in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dacic told reporters that there were early indications connecting the attack with people suspected of being linked to the Wahhabi movement -- an ultra-conservative branch of Islam that dominates in Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said several people had been arrested for "prevention reasons" and that overall security had been stepped up in Belgrade. Special prosecutors had taken over the case, added Dacic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic strongly condemned what he labelled a "heinous terrorist act".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an act of insanity, which cannot be attributed to any religion and any nation. It is a crime of an individual," he said, according to quotes from the Beta news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said his country would firmly respond to the threat of terrorism and stressed Serbian citizens could "feel safe".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli foreign ministry called it an "attempted terrorist attack in the vicinity" of the country's embassy in Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The embassy is closed and no employee of the embassy was injured", it said in a statement, saying the circumstances are still being investigated. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen continued his imperious form in Red Bull's homeland on Saturday when, after winning the sprint race, he claimed a convincing pole position for Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The series leader and three-time world champion clocked a best lap in 1 minute 4.314 seconds to outpace nearest rival Lando Norris of McLaren by 0.404sec for his fourth Austrian pole at the Red Bull Ring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also ended a run of three races where he was beaten in qualifying in Monaco, Canada and Spain and brought him his 40th career pole position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That went really well," said Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to adjust things a bit after this morning and it went well. It was warmer than yesterday and a bit tricky but the car felt good and I could attack the corners much more. It felt on point and really good out there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a while since we've been on pole and we have worked hard to be more competitive.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris said: "I think that was the best we could do today and Max was in a league of his own - but I am happy and I'll take that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George Russell took third for Mercedes ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes, Charles Leclerc in his Ferrari and Oscar Piastri in the second McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piastri's best flying lap was deleted for exceeding track limits in the closing minutes when he briefly went third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sergio Perez was eighth in the second Red Bull, continuing his struggles, ahead of Haas's Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Ocon of Alpine. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Saturday said it strongly disapproves of remarks by the US regarding the human rights situation in the city. This came after the US published its 2023 Report on International Religious Freedom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the US report was another attempt to slander the SAR under the guise of religious freedom. It accused the US of piling up false stories and fabricating narratives. It said residents of Hong Kong enjoy the right of religious freedom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also called on the US to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.

 Tuen Mun Magistrates' Court on Saturday ordered a psychiatric assessment of a man, who allegedly tried to kill his wife and three daughters by burning charcoal at a public housing flat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 43-year-old faces four counts of attempted murder. He allegedly lit the charcoal before fleeing the flat on Shan King Estate in Tuen Mun on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Principal Magistrate Daniel Tang adjourned the case to July 12, pending psychiatric reports to determine whether the man is fit to enter a plea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was remanded in custody.

    Security chief says being a fugitive has a high cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security Chris Tang on Saturday said that the government revoked the passports of six wanted people this month to send a message that there was a high cost to being a fugitive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an interview to mark the second anniversary of the current administration, Tang said fugitives might also lose any foreign travel documents once they were no longer of use to those harbouring them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know why these people think that, 'maybe I'll still have the opportunity to travel to other places by using my refugee status as a refugee or another status.' I'm not entirely sure in this regard," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But firstly, you'll not be able to use Hong Kong SAR passports to travel; and secondly, while you may now have value because others sympathise with you - and they have granted you travel documents - you might lose those documents, when you no longer have any value. Then you won't be able to travel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six people wanted here for alleged national security offences under homegrown national security legislation include Nathan Law, Mung Siu-tat, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng, Johnny Fok and Tony Choi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the security minister also called on Alman Chan, the wanted principal of drug rehabilitation centre Christian Zheng Sheng College, to return to Hong Kong from the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others - including Chan, who denies the allegations - were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that Alman Chan said on social media that 'Oh I did not take any funds from the college and the issue has nothing to do with me, and I'm not involved'.."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this is true, I hope he has the courage to return to Hong Kong and explain to us clearly about the whole matter. On the one hand you are running away, and on the other you are making such remarks. This has no meaning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Tang said authorities would make sure that the July 1 celebrations pass off peacefully.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on why there are now fewer protests on July 1, Tang said that, although protesting is allowed, a protest might be hijacked by people with ulterior motives so residents are choosing other options instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe Hongkongers, after going through what happened in 2019, they clearly know that - while they want to hold a peaceful protest - many people, who wish to endanger national security or Hong Kong's security, might take the opportunity to conduct acts endangering national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said Hong Kong residents know that they might be used, so they have chosen other ways to express their opinions. He also said residents might just feel the government is doing a good job.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong would grasp opportunities to innovate and transform the economy. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759582_2_20240629151414.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said that the city's 'One Country, Two Systems' governing principle is a world-recognised success, and that local residents know clearly that there's no change in the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng was speaking at a celebratory event in Victoria Park ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 27 years, which areas in Hong Kong have changed and which have not? While outsiders can pretend not to know, local residents clearly know that there's no change to the city's governing principle," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can clearly see that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle has not changed. The city's high degree of autonomy has not changed, its legal environment has not changed, the business environment has not changed, democracy and freedom have not changed, the way people live their lives has not changed, the city's international character has not changed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And at the same time, we can see all the positive changes in the city since the return to the Motherland. Hong Kong has moved from colonial rule to being the 'apple of the country's eye'," he added, hinting that more policies benefiting the SAR will come along the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also speaking at the event, Chief Executive John Lee again noted that Hong Kong will go all out to boost the economy, in spite of challenges that the SAR might face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is now undergoing economic transformation and it will face different new challenges. But Hong Kong people have always been able to adapt," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So as long as we grasp new opportunities, innovate for change, and strive to be stronger in our various posts... we'll surely reach more glorious achievements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's top leader also reviewed his work over the past two years via a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, the rolling out of light public housing, efforts to shorten the waiting time for the public housing, the removal of the property cooling measures, as well as the hosting of events to spur economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described his administration as a boat navigating the winds and tides, adding that many policies are gradually bearing fruit.

    Retail sector moves to cater for new allowances
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association says that the increased allowances will offer a boost to the retail industry. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759565_1_20240629121734.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse, said on Saturday that the industry will aim to offer more products that cater for the new duty-free shopping allowances announced by Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland shoppers heading back to the mainland will see their allowances more than double to 12,000 yuan from 5,000 yuan when returning from Hong Kong and Macau at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau Tse said that while the increased allowances did not match the annual 100,000 yuan duty-free shopping allowances in the mainland province of Hainan, it's hard to compare the two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [duty-free] system in Hainan island is really different from that in Hong Kong. There are different supporting systems for Hainan to achieve such [a quota], as it has real-name systems to keep track of how many things a customer buys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, the duty-free sales in Hainan are monopolised by one group. In other words, it is much simpler to manage a system within one single group, whereas in Hong Kong, we have so many retailers, all of which are duty-free. So how can we set up one system with them all together? It is challenging..."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Tommy Cheung said that the increase was a gift from Beijing ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also urged the government to keep lobbying for allowance increases and an expansion of the multiple-entry limits for mainland visitors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board, Ng Yut-ming, has resigned amid a government plan to reform the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the board's website, Ng's tenure in office ended on Friday, following the earlier departure of six other members: Toby Ho, Grace Wong, Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means only one elected member, Oscar Lai, remains on the board. The three-year term for the current board is set to expire in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to start the second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the body next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.

    Brazil up their game to beat Paraguay 4-1

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brazil forward Vinicius Junior anticipates the ball during the second half. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759569_1_20240629130036.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazil's Vinicius Jr scored twice in his side's 4-1 Copa America victory over Paraguay in a Group D clash in Nevada on Friday, bouncing back from a lacklustre display in his first game of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Colombia, who have qualified for the quarter-finals, top Group D with six points after two matches, with Brazil in second on four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costa Rica are third with one point and Paraguay, who are bottom with zero after two defeats, have been eliminated from the competition in the group stage for only the second time since 2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This victory marked Brazil's first win in six competitive matches and their maiden competitive win under the management of Dorival Jr, who took charge of the team in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the whistle, Vinicius' pace and trickery posed a constant threat to Paraguay down the left flank, a far cry from his performance in Brazil's 0-0 draw with Costa Rica in their opening group stage match, in which he was largely ineffectual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Brazil's strong start, it was Paraguay who almost went ahead in the 15th minute as Damian Bobadilla's goal-bound effort took a massive deflection off Eder Militao and nearly wrongfooted Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who showed quick reflexes to keep out the strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil earned a 28th-minute penalty for a handball, which was fired wide by Lucas Paqueta, but the midfielder made up for his miss seven minutes later as he set up Vinicius with a first-time pass to cap off a flowing team move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girona winger Savio doubled Brazil's advantage after pouncing on a rebound inside the box, before Vinicius stuck out a boot to divert a clearance from Omar Alderete into the net for his second goal of the night in first half stoppage time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paraguay got a goal back after the break as Alderete netted a superb long-range, but any hopes of a comeback were swiftly dashed when Brazil were awarded a penalty in the 68th minute after a handball by Mathias Villasanti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his earlier miss, Paqueta stepped up and made no mistake at the second time of asking to send Brazil's fans at the Allegiant Stadium into delirium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Towards the end of the match, tempers flared and Andres Cubas was shown a red card after kicking out at Douglas Luiz, with Brazil using their man's advantage to comfortably see out the game and clinch the three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In particular the first half, up to the 40 minutes, it was very even," Paraguay coach Daniel Garnero told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we created some opportunities. Unfortunately, in the three minutes we got a bit distracted and they scored two goals that made a great difference in the result. And Vinicius is an elite player, no doubt about it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil next face group leaders Colombia in California on Tuesday, where a draw would be enough to secure qualification for the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paraguay face Costa Rica, who retain a slim chance of progressing to the quarter-finals, in Texas. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government will adjust fees for Accident and Emergency departments, based on factors such as public affordability and social acceptance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, he said the financial burden on patients suffering from major illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, could be huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo told reporters that officials are mulling a cap on medical fees paid by severely ill patients and increasing subsidies for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Considering the major illnesses, a very common example these days will be patients with cancer. It's actually a major burden for the patient and for the family as well. Because with the advance in healthcare, especially in cancer treatment, some of these medications can be very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though most of us believe that we are healthy and want ourselves to be healthy... One day we may have a major illness like cancer or a stroke and we want to ensure that the current healthcare system in Hong Kong can provide a safety net for these people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lo said an independent committee set up by the Hospital Authority (HA) to review a spate of medical blunders comprises members from various backgrounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister said the list of committee members, which includes patient organisations, people with experience in managing medical systems and handling medical equipment, will be announced shortly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered a comprehensive and systemic review at the HA after a series of medical incidents and issues with equipment at public hospitals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three suspected leaders of a failed coup against Bolivian President Luis Arce were remanded in custody on Friday for six months, the country's top prosecutor said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former army chief Juan Jose Zuniga, former head of navy Juan Arnez and Alejandro Irahola, former head of the army's mechanized brigade, will be held in a high-security prison not far from the capital La Paz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This pre-trial detention ordered by the judge will undoubtedly set a precedent, and is a good signal for the investigation to move forward," said Attorney General Cesar Siles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three officers face charges of engaging in an armed uprising and terrorism and face up to 20 years in prison, Siles said on state television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 21 active, retired and civilian military personnel were arrested in connection with Wednesday's attempted coup, in which troops and tanks were deployed in the heart of the capital, where they tried to break down a door of the presidential palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuniga said his goal was to "restructure democracy" in Bolivia. He was soon captured and the troops pulled back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an unusual twist, Zuniga claimed he was following Arce's orders and that the president had hoped for the coup to trigger a crackdown that would boost his popularity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arce denied the allegations. "How could one order or plan a coup on one's self?" he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions in the Andean nation have been rising in recent weeks over surging prices, shortages of dollars and fuel, and a feud between Arce and powerful former president Evo Morales ahead of the 2025 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced Thursday that he would soon visit his "friend" Arce to support him following the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia "strongly" condemned the attempted military coup, its foreign ministry said Thursday, warning against "destructive foreign interference" in the South American country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres "welcomes the peaceful resolution of the situation," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, having earlier expressed alarm over the abortive coup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Condemnations of the coup bid also poured in from Madrid, Washington and across Latin America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolivia, which has a long history of military coups, has in recent weeks been rocked by an economic crisis due to a drop in natural gas production, its main source of foreign currency until 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country has had to reduce fuel imports, and there is a shortage of dollars, which has triggered protests by powerful unions of merchants and freight transporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government at Cornell University in New York state, told AFP the failed coup was "a symptom of a significant and broad discontent" in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, "we must carefully evaluate how widespread the discontent is within the armed forces," he said, adding that Arce's government was facing "a critical moment of weakness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolivia is also deeply polarized after years of political instability, and the ruling Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party is riven by internal conflict between supporters of Arce and his former mentor Morales. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett donated another US$5.3 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities, his biggest annual donation since he began making them in 2006.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Buffett's donation boosted his overall giving to the charities to about US$57 billion, including to the family charities in the last two Novembers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest donation, announced on Friday, included about 13 million Berkshire Class B shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett donated 9.93 million shares to the Gates Foundation, and has donated more than US$43 billion of Berkshire shares there overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also donated 993,035 shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and 695,122 shares to each of three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the NoVo Foundation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett, 93, plans to give away more than 99% of the fortune he built at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which he has run since 1965, with his children serving as executors of his will.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berkshire is an approximately $880 billion conglomerate that owns dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and stocks such as Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett still owns 14.5 percent of Berkshire's outstanding shares, a Friday regulatory filing shows, despite having given away more than half of his stock since 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His US$128.4 billion fortune makes him the world's 10th-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Buffett said he was worth about US$44 billion when the donations began, but that the benefits of compounding, "simple and generally sound capital deployment" at Berkshire, and the "American tailwind" produced his current wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates also pioneered the Giving Pledge, in which 245 people like OpenAI's Sam Altman, Michael Bloomberg, Carl Icahn, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg committed at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation works in reproductive health. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation works to alleviate hunger, mitigate conflicts including in Ukraine, and improve public safety. The Sherwood Foundation supports Nebraska nonprofits, and the NoVo Foundation has initiatives focused on girls and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's filing suggests based on Buffett's holdings that Berkshire has repurchased little or none of its own stock since April 19. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759547_1_20240629093722.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombia marched into the quarter-finals of the Copa America on Friday with a confident 3-0 victory over Costa Rica in Arizona.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Luis Diaz, Davinson Sanchez and Jhon Cordoba sealed all three points for the Colombians, who are now guaranteed a top two-finish in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game next Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Colombians will head into that game brimming with confidence after extending their unbeaten streak to 25 games at Glendale's State Farm Stadium on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nestor Lorenzo's well-organised side have not lost since a defeat to Argentina in February 2022, and never looked like surrendering that record on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool star Diaz opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after Costa Rica goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira inexplicably crashed into Jhon Cordoba on the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diaz stepped up to smash an emphatic spot-kick into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia almost doubled their tally on 37 minutes, with veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picking out Diaz at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diaz poked a cross into the six-yard area but center-back Davinson Sanchez just couldn't get a touch to guide the ball into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made no such mistake in the 59th minute, however, as he glanced in Jhon Arias's cross from the left to make it 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cordoba then grabbed Colombia's third on 62 minutes with the best goal of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exquisite through ball from Rodriguez split the Costa Rica defence and sent Cordoba racing in on goal, the 31-year-old whipping a shot across goal into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Friday's other Copa America game, Brazil take on Paraguay in Las Vegas hoping to get their first win of the tournament after an opening 0-0 draw with Costa Rica. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 America's most influential newspaper, The New York Times, called in an editorial on Friday for President Joe Biden to step aside and allow another Democrat to challenge Donald Trump for the White House in November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Describing Biden as "the shadow of a great public servant," the newspaper's editorial board - which is separate from its newsroom - said Thursday's debate between the president and Trump proved the 81-year-old "failed his own test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His determination to run again is a "reckless gamble," it said, adding: "the greatest public service Mr Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election." (AFP)

    River Seine fails water quality tests before Olympics

<div class="itemFullText">
 The river Seine is still failing water quality tests one month before the Paris Olympics when it is scheduled to host the open-water swimming competition and the swimming leg of the triathlon, results showed Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latest tests, completed last week and released by the Paris mayor's office, showed levels of the E.Coli bacteria – an indicator of faecal matter – are far above the upper limits imposed by sports federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water quality remains degraded because of unfavourable hydrological conditions, little sunshine, below-average seasonal temperatures and upstream pollution," the mayor's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities have spent 1.4 billion euros (US$1.5 billion) in the last decade trying to clean up the river by improving the Paris sewerage system, as well as building new water treatment and storage facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But major storms still overwhelm the capital's waste water network, some of which dates back to the 19th century, leading to discharges of untreated sewage directly into the river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers insist that some dry weather and sunshine in July should be sufficient to make the Seine fit for the outdoor swimming events. (AFP)

    UAE cuts Friday sermons at mosques over sizzling heat

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Arab Emirates has shortened Friday sermons at mosques to protect worshippers from severe heat, amid rising summer temperatures linked to climate change.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The General Authority of Islamic Affairs ordered preachers to limit Friday sermons to 10 minutes from June to October, when temperatures cool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sermons usually last for 20 minutes for the main weekly prayers on Fridays but can run even longer, with large crowds gathering outside mosques at midday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was aimed at ensuring "the safety of worshippers... especially during the summer months", the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It coincides with UAE authorities' efforts to avoid heat strokes and other complications as temperatures approach 50 degrees Celsius in parts of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From June until September, the UAE prohibits work under direct sunlight and in open-air areas between noon and 3pm as part of a longstanding "midday break" policy widely adopted across the Gulf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The desert region, already one of the world's hottest, faces rising threats from high temperatures attributed to climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, more than 1,300 people died while performing the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia during intense heat, according to Saudi authorities. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French authorities said gatherings in the Pacific territory of New Caledonia would be banned this weekend and a curfew extended, weeks after deadly riots and as the country prepares for high-stakes snap polls starting Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France is on tenterhooks ahead of a two-round vote which could see the anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic far right take the largest number of seats in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first round takes place on Sunday, followed by a second round on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Commission, which represents the French state in the archipelago, announced a ban on gatherings from Saturday morning until Sunday evening in New Caledonia, which was hit by the deadly unrest last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-May, rioting and looting erupted in New Caledonia over an electoral reform plan that Indigenous Kanak people feared would leave them in a permanent minority, putting independence hopes definitively out of reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Commission also said that the 8.00pm to 6.00am curfew in place since the start of the riots had been extended until July 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High Commissioner Louis Le Franc noted that the situation "had improved", but pointed out that public infrastructure had recently sustained "very serious damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 1,500 people have been arrested since the unrest began in New Caledonia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence has left nine dead and damage estimated at more than 1.5 billion euros (US$1.6 billion). (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The departure of more members from a social worker regulator would not affect its operation, according to Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, after six of them had left amid a looming reform of the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Social Workers Registration Board's website, Toby Ho and Grace Wong's terms ended on Thursday. Four others - Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan - also left earlier this month, leaving only two elected members behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that several elected members chose to resign. This was their own decision," the labour chief told reporters on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new amendment bill is very clear. Even if members resign, it will not affect the board's operation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development came as lawmakers are set to start a second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the regulator. It proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new body can also promptly disqualify social workers convicted of serious offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Legislative Council passes the amendment bill on July 3, we plan to gazette it on July 5 and the old registration board will then cease to operate," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sector, society, and the government all hope that it can be a seamless transition. To do that, we need to appoint members to the board as soon as the bill is gazetted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also defended the administration's decision to inform board members in advance that they have to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR on July 5, describing it as a "responsible" move.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday warned of potential traffic jams at boundary checkpoints near the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, as scores of travellers are expected to head north for the July 1 long weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently SAR motorists planning to travel to Macau or Zhuhai must make reservations in advance. All northbound slots for Saturday have been snapped up, while limited places are available for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have been urged to address bottlenecks near the Zhuhai checkpoint, after travellers heading back to the SAR were stuck for hours on Tuen Mun Festival earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it has installed cameras so that people can check out the traffic condition at the Hong Kong port's vehicle clearance plaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It anticipates northbound traffic to peak on Saturday, while most will return on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department will closely monitor the traffic conditions at all ports, and strengthen the dissemination of the latest traffic information to citizens who use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to travel between the three places," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Motorists have been urged to plan their return trip ahead, and travel in off-peak hours "as far as possible".

<div class="itemFullText">
 There have been mixed reactions to an increase in the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau, with some welcoming the move and others saying it doesn't go far enough.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Beijing announced that it will increase the allowance from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Tsim Sha Tsui, a mainland tourist said he hopes to see the allowance increased further because he normally spends around 100,000 yuan in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope it can be raised to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, because women’s bags usually cost around that. Also, large jewellery and cosmetics items almost always cost more than ten thousand dollars," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Central, a visitor from Shenzhen said he will spend more in the SAR after the measure takes effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the original limit of 5,000 yuan is not enough because many electronic products cost more than 5,000 yuan... This adjustment will greatly stimulate mainland consumers' purchasing power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shanghai tourist said the increase won't make a difference to him, because he's only in Hong Kong to watch a concert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't really affect me because I don't buy much in Hong Kong. And now prices in Hong Kong are probably similar to the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Retail Management Association said the measure is an important step forward and it hopes the SAR government will continue to pay attention to the needs and development of the industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new promenade was opened in Kennedy Town on Friday, with officials touting it as an excellent area for people to take photos of Victoria Harbour and the Tsing Ma Bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony, Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said the 280-metre-long promenade connecting Cadogan Street and Sai Ning Street provides more space for events, and will attract visitors to the neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this new promenade will become an excellent resting place where everyone can come to the seaside for walks and picnics with family and friends. Organisers can also hold various youth activities, exhibitions and markets here to make the atmosphere more harmonious and to make the economy more prosperous in the coming days," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Central and Western District Office will also utilise the space to hold more activities to add life and vitality to the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said the Cadogan Street Promenade will be accessible 24 hours a day and is equipped with shaded seating areas.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers have opened the Chang'e-6 returner and successfully collected the lunar samples.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Chang'e-6 mission collected 1,935.3 grams of samples from the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration handed over the sample container to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) at a ceremony held in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the event, the spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission Ge Ping told reporters that "we have found that the samples brought back by Chang'e-6 were more viscous compared to previous samples, with the presence of clumps".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers will carry out the storage and processing of the samples as planned and initiate scientific research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The samples, collected from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history, hold unique scientific significance as they will further enhance the understanding of lunar evolution, accelerate the pace of peaceful exploration and utilisation of lunar resources, and serve as an important asset for all humanity, CNSA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 probe was launched on May 3. Its returner, carrying the lunar samples, landed in its designated area in Inner Mongolia on June 25, marking a complete success for the mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The returner safely arrived in Beijing later. Researchers opened it and successfully collected the lunar sample container on Wednesday, according to CNSA. (Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Flights are disrupted after a portion of the canopy at the departure area of Terminal 1 collapses.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy rainfall and winds brought down a roof at the main airport in New Delhi on Friday, killing one person and disrupting flights from a domestic terminal, while flooded streets and traffic snarls threw daily life out of gear in India's capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airport area received about 148.5mm of rain over three hours in the early morning, more than the average for all of June, according to India's weather office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city of 20 million people received 228.1mm rainfall at its main Safdarjung weather station in the 24 hours ending 8.30am local time on Friday, a 266 percent departure from normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A portion of the canopy at the departure area of Terminal 1 collapsed and flight operations were shut down until 2pm, India's aviation minister told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The entire terminal, one of three at the country's biggest and busiest airport, was evacuated and an inquiry ordered into the collapse, said the minister, Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue work had been completed and eight injured people were taken to hospital, said Atul Garg, the director of Delhi Fire Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 flights were cancelled and 40 were delayed while departures from Delhi airport were running late by an average of 50 minutes, according to data from flight tracking platform Flightradar24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arrivals and departures of flights scheduled from Terminal 1 after 2pm were diverted through the other two terminuses, Naidu said, adding that passengers will receive full refunds or have the option of booking on alternate flights and routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visuals from Indian TV channels showed a taxi crushed under a wrecked metal pillar at the entrance area of the terminal, which is mostly used by low-cost carriers IndiGo, operated by Interglobe Aviation, and SpiceJet for domestic flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 10-12 cars were damaged and vehicles were still being pulled out from under the debris, said one of the workers at the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I first missed my flight in the morning due to floods. Then my 2.10pm Indigo flight to Bangalore has been cancelled. I have to urgently reach Bangalore for an official meeting," said Asif Ali, a businessman standing outside Terminal 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many other parts of Delhi were flooded as well and cars trapped in thigh-deep water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Metro services were affected, traffic snarls were reported from several parts of the city while several residents also complained of power cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the April-May general election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of new terminal buildings at 15 airports at a cost of 98 billion rupees (US$1.17 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Delhi's Terminal 1 and the terminal at Jabalpur were part of the projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposition parties criticised Modi's government, saying projects were inaugurated in a hurry before the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption and criminal negligence is responsible for the collapse of shoddy infrastructure falling like a deck of cards, in the past 10 years of Modi Govt," Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the main opposition Congress party, said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aviation Minister Naidu defended the government, saying the roof collapse at Delhi's airport was part of an old building that was opened in 2009 and not the one Modi inaugurated in March. (Reuters)

 Competition climbing only made its debut at the last Olympics in Tokyo, and the chances of Hong Kong climbers making it to Paris this summer are slim.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has reiterated the central government's commitment to maintaining the "One Country, Two Systems" governing principle for Hong Kong, while urging the city to capitalise on its unique advantages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, on Friday described the territory's prosperity and stability as "rock solid", and said the rule of law, business environment, as well as democracy and freedom in the SAR, remain unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shortly after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration 40 years ago, British-Hong Kong authorities unilaterally made changes to many of their promises. The last governor, Chris Patten, arbitrarily laid 'political landmines' for Hong Kong," Zheng told a Legislative Council luncheon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the central government's commitment has never changed, and it has offered extreme care for Hong Kong.".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told lawmakers that the city has "risen from the ashes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The central government fully supports Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is rapidly advancing from stability to prosperity. The biggest change is that Hong Kong has transformed from a humiliating colony run by outsiders to the apple of the country's eye," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong serves as the bridge for the world to understand China, enter China, and shake hands with China... [Integrating into the country] will not marginalise Hong Kong, or even 'mainlandise' the city. Instead, it will further strengthen Hong Kong's status and advantages, and have better achievements."

    Biden, Trump exchange barbs in fierce debate

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Biden stumbled over his words on several occasions while Trump made false allegations against his rival. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759440_1_20240628133105.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden delivered an uneven performance while his Republican rival Donald Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks at their debate on Thursday, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged personal insults ahead of the November election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two men traded barbs on abortion, immigration, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, their handling of the economy and even their golf games as they each sought to shake up what opinion polls show has been a virtually tied race for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hoarse-sounding Biden stumbled over his words on several occasions during the debate's first half-hour. But he found his footing at the halfway mark when he attacked Trump over his conviction for covering up hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, calling him a "felon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Trump brought up the recent conviction of Biden's son, Hunter, for lying about his drug use to buy a gun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later, Biden noted that almost all of Trump's former cabinet members, including former Vice President Mike Pence, have not endorsed his campaign. "They know him well, they served with him," he said. "Why are they not endorsing him?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, meanwhile, unleashed a barrage of criticisms, many of which were well-worn falsehoods he has long repeated, including claims that migrants have carried out a crime wave, that Democrats support infanticide and that he actually won the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden's delivery from the beginning of the debate drew the most attention afterward. Trump's allies immediately declared victory while prominent Democrats publicly questioned whether Biden could move forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the panic had set in,” said David Axelrod, a longtime advisor to former President Barack Obama on CNN, immediately after the debate about Biden's performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And I think you’re going to hear discussions that, I don’t know will lead to anything, but there are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Van Jones, another Democratic strategist, said on CNN: “He did not do well at all.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One top Biden donor, who did not want to be identified while criticising the president, called his performance "disqualifying" and said he expected a fresh round of calls for him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice President Kamala Harris, appearing on CNN after the debate, acknowledged what she called Biden's "slow start" but argued that voters should judge him and Trump based on their years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about his performance in the debate, Biden told reporters afterwards that “I think we did well,” but said he has a sore throat. Pressed about Democratic concerns with his showing that he should consider stepping aside, Biden said, "No, it's hard to debate a liar.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, were both under pressure to display their fitness for office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been dogged by questions about his age and sharpness, while Trump's incendiary rhetoric and sprawling legal woes remain a vulnerability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many television viewers took to social media to complain, describing the debate as a "disaster," a "train wreck," and a "waste of time," expressing concerns about America's future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple polls show that the majority of American voters are weary of another Biden-Trump matchup in the 2024 presidential election, with the proportion of voters holding negative views of both candidates reaching the highest level in 30 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second presidential debate for the 2024 U.S. election, to be hosted by ABC, is scheduled to take place on September 10. (Agencies)

 Politicians and industry representatives on Friday welcomed Beijing's move to raise the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities announced that the limit will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, told reporters that the move will boost the city's retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that with this initiative, tourists from the mainland can shop more freely and it can benefit our various industries, especially the retail industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that local authorities have to do their part to make the SAR a more attractive place for tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the two sessions in Beijing in March, delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) signed a petition asking for the duty-free allowance to be increased to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the increase announced is a "good beginning", even though it's lower than the amount proposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This arrangement is exclusive. This arrangement is fair to both parties, and this arrangement can be adjusted going forward. And at the same time, it will be a boost to our retail industry and to our tourism industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation also welcomed Beijing's move, adding that the SAR government can work with malls to promote Hong Kong as a "shopping paradise".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, said it will hand out 500,000 sets of offers worth more than HK$100 million to overnight visitors to Hong Kong starting from July 11, including sightseeing, transport, dining and consumption discounts.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city's government-owned investment vehicle aims to forge a more competitive tech-innovation ecosystem in the SAR, as he highlighted its differences with Singapore's sovereign investment arm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has been considered by some as a local version of Temasek in Singapore, Chan said the two bodies are “completely different” in an interview marking two years of the current administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s like comparing apples and oranges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two goals of the HKIC are to generate appropriate financial returns, and to help boost the innovation and technology industries and create a local ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Other than conducting its own investments, a more important [function of the firm] is that it will serve as a guide for other long-term and sovereign wealth funds and to invest in certain sectors together... to create a domino effect and attract HK$100 billion, or HK$200 billion or even HK$300 billion,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the government investment vehicle, which was set up two years ago and manages some HK$62 billion in assets, is still operating at an initial stage with only two deals signed so far, and authorities will reveal more details regarding projects with the release of its yearly report later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKIC signed deals with tech firms SmartMore and BioMap InnoHub earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the local property market, Chan said it remains stable despite a drop in prices in May, snapping a two-month increase following the removal of all cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid fluctuations in the residential property prices because they're affected by multiple factors, including interest rates as well as supply and demand. They're also affected by how people perceive the outlook of the property market and the city’s economic situation, job market, etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe the most important thing for the government is to maintain a healthy development of the property market, in other words, not to have major fluctuations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary added the government will keep ramping up land supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also expressed confidence towards the SAR economy in the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the economy was in its recovery stage in the first six months of 2024 and was still facing challenges, a series of mega events in the next six months will further boost local economic activity.

 Beijing on Friday announced that the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People who buy goods at duty-free stores at border crossings will continue to get an extra allowance of 3,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The change will take effect on July 1 at Lo Wu, Futian, Shenzhen Bay, West Kowloon Station, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Gongbei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policy will be implemented at all border crossings from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the new arrangements would raise local spending by HK$8.8 billion to HK$17.6 billion and generate added value of about HK$2.7 billion to HK$5.4 billion to the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee welcomed the move, saying it shows the central government's support for Hong Kong's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new measure will enhance the shopping experience for mainland resident visitors in Hong Kong and allow them greater flexibility when shopping, which is beneficial for Hong Kong in attracting more visitors and boosting the development of diversified tourism," he said.
