<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africans began voting on Wednesday in the most competitive election since the end of apartheid, with opinion polls suggesting the African National Congress (ANC) would lose its parliamentary majority after 30 years in government.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Then led by Nelson Mandela, the ANC swept to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election in 1994 and won a majority in national elections held every five years since then, though its share of the vote has gradually declined.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Wednesday's election, voters choose the 400 members of the National Assembly and these MPs will then go on in the coming weeks to choose a president from among their number.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Candidates for South Africa's nine provincial assemblies were also on the ballot.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If it falls short of a 50 percent majority, the ANC could be forced to negotiate a coalition deal with one or more of the smaller parties in order to continue governing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Analysts expect the ANC to do well enough to remain the largest party in parliament,
 <br/>
 meaning its leader, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, was likely to stay in office, unless he faced an internal challenge if the party's performance was worse than expected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Voter dissatisfaction over high rates of unemployment and crime, frequent power blackouts and corruption in party ranks lies behind the ANC's gradual fall from grace. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said efforts are underway to respond to a court order on formulating an official framework to recognise same-sex partnerships following a landmark ruling last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Court of Final Appeal ruled last September that the government has a constitutional duty to allow gay couples to register their partnerships, in a case brought by former activist Jimmy Sham who married his male partner in New York in 2013.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The top court said the government would be given two years to come up with an alternative framework so that same-sex relationships could be provided legal recognition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a written reply to a request by lawmaker Regina Ip for an update on the situation, constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang said officials are "actively taking forward the relevant work" and will seek the views of the Legislative Council in due course, once there are concrete suggestions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tsang also said the matter is complex and involves a wide range of issues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are now following the court's relevant judgment and timetable, conducting detailed study with the [Department of Justice] and relevant bureaux on the mechanism relating to the legal recognition of same-sex relationship, thresholds of recognition, eligibilities, conditions, how to effectively avoid abuses of the alternative framework, etc, as well as the rights and obligations arisen, including 'core rights' and 'supplementary rights', and formulating implementation," he said.

<img alt="Paul Chan met with representatives from five SAR startups currently exploring opportunities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755181_3_20240529124657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday told business leaders in San Francisco that the SAR is a “natural launching pad” for them to enter the Asian and China markets, as he promoted collaboration between the China-US bay areas on a five-day trip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a business luncheon, Chan said there were many commonalities between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area, with the two places the global engines of technological innovation and also the birthplaces of tech firm giants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area are a magnet, attracting a lot of talent, that is our competitive advantage, and also this will give us continuous impetus in terms of innovation and technological development,” Chan said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He went on to point out there’s also a difference between the two places in terms of population and market sizes, as the Californian bay area has a population of about seven million, while the Guangdong bay area population stands at some 87 million, with huge market potential contributing to some 12 percent of the Chinese economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “So if you want to launch your products or services in Asia, in China, Hong Kong is naturally your launching pad, because from here you can springboard to other parts of the mainland and Asia,” he told delegates, noting the SAR’s financial markets are much bigger in breadth and depth compared with Singapore.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between InvestHK and San Francisco’s Bay Area Council to promote cooperation especially in the green economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, the finance minister also met with representatives of five Hong Kong startups currently exploring expansion in San Francisco.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The five SAR startups specialise in areas including biodegradable materials, new construction materials, online marketing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and the entrepreneurs are exploring the market there whilst undertaking training programmes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The finance chief also welcomed a plan by a Silicon Valley startup accelerator company to set up a technological innovation centre in the SAR.

    Jørn Andersen resigns as head coach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong football head coach Jørn Andersen announced on Wednesday that he has resigned with immediate effect.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Andersen said he had received an offer "he couldn't refuse", without disclosing which club it came from.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He told reporters that the local football association "had made every effort to retain" him, offering him a new three-year contract being as his original deal was due to expire next summer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "After much careful consideration, I have made a difficult decision and decide to take a new challenge, and step down as coach of the Hong Kong, China representative team," Andersen said at a press conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have recently received an invitation from a club outside that presents an opportunity that I simply cannot refuse."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Norwegian thanked the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, as well as the SAR government, his staff, players and the fans for their support throughout "a fantastic journey" in the past two and a half years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I thank all the players who train with me, play with me. And at last, I thank all the great Hong Kong fans who support us everywhere, wherever we were playing."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier this year, the coach, 61, had spoken to the press about the association not offering him a new contract.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The association, for its part, said Andersen informed them of his intention to leave on Monday, and officially tabled his resignation on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Assistant coach Wolfgang Luisser has been named interim head coach, with Szeto Man-chun joining the coaching staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Andersen took up the head coach role in late 2021. He is considered to have successfully changed the team's culture by playing with a high pressing, attacking style that was relatively rare in the SAR squad.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In January, he led the team to its first Asian Cup berth since 1968, with the squad putting up inspiring battles despite defeats against Asian heavyweights Iran and the United Arab Emirates, as well as a surprising Palestinian team.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Team Hong Kong, China also made history at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year, when Andersen took the under-23 squad to advance to the semi-final stage for the first time ever.

    Record temperatures scorch India's capital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures in India's capital soared to a record-high 49.9 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, the government's weather bureau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The India Meteorological Department, which reported "severe heat-wave conditions", recorded the temperatures at two New Delhi suburb stations at Narela and Mungeshpur.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Forecasters predict similar temperatures on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In May 2022, parts of New Delhi hit 49.2 degrees Celsius.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 India is no stranger to searing summer temperatures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But scientists have found climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 New Delhi authorities also warned of the risk of water shortages as the capital swelters in an intense heatwave -- cutting supplies to some areas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 India's Water Minister Atishi Marlena called for "collective responsibility" to stop wasteful water use, the Times of India newspaper reported Wednesday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's attorney general's office on Wednesday said former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra would be prosecuted for insulting the monarchy over comments he made almost a decade ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prayuth Pecharakun, spokesman for the attorney general, said Thaksin would be summoned to court on June 18 to answer charges under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thaksin, 74, is a two-time premier who was ousted in a 2006 coup and then lived in self exile for 15 years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He returned to Thailand last year as his Pheu Thai party took power at the head of a coalition government.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The attorney general has decided to indict Thaksin for insulting the monarchy," Prayuth told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The attorney general cannot bring him to court today, as his (Thaksin's) lawyer said he has Covid."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thailand has some of the world's strictest royal defamation laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each charge bringing a potential 15-year prison sentence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thaksin's lawyer, Winyat Chatmontree, said he would fight the charges. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s lived-in home prices rose for the second straight month in April, increasing by 0.3 percent from March, with all home sizes seeing gains.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Wednesday showed that the latest official price index of second-hand units stood at 308.7 last month, compared with 305.7 in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The increase was broad-based, as all small, medium, and large sized units saw gains of about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It also came after the index logged its first increase in 11 months in March, as buyers returned to the market after Financial Secretary Paul Chan scrapped all property cooling measures in his Budget on February 28.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, taking the first four months in total, home prices still fell 0.84 percent, and the latest index level was still about 13 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rental prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent on a monthly basis, also a second straight increase, but still 4.6 percent lower from the same period last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The city’s rents rose 0.5 percent in the first four months of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local star footballer Philip Chan won the Hong Kong Footballer of the Year award on Tuesday, the first player from the SAR to do so since goalkeeper Edmond Yapp in 2016.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Tai Po midfielder scooped three further trophies at the Top Football Awards Ceremony, including Fan's Favourite, with over 4,500 votes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He took home a total of HK$60,000 in prize money by also winning the award for the best player from the local top-flight representing the SAR in international competition, as well as being named one of the midfielders in the season's Best XI.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tai Po finished second in the league this season, with Chan often scoring last-minute winners for the team.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The midfielder, 31, also scored the 1,000th goal in the history of the Asian Cup in January while playing for the SAR team in Qatar.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Eastern swept a number of awards, with Roberto Losada winning Coach of the Year, striker Noah Baffoe Player's Favourite, and midfielders Jesse Yu and Ma Hei-wai named Young Players of the Year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Novak Djokovic shrugged off his recent troubles to sweep to his 93rd career win at the French Open on Tuesday, extending his run of first round Roland Garros victories to a perfect 20.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Djokovic, chasing a fourth title in Paris and record 25th Grand Slam triumph, came through against 142nd-ranked French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-4, 7-6 [7/3], 6-4.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 37-year-old, who saw career-long rival and 14-time champion Rafael Nadal exit the tournament on Monday, had arrived under a cloud.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For the first time since 2018, he is without a title and has yet to reach a final this season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a victory in three sets, that's what matters at this moment. I felt better compared to the last few weeks. I was focused. I encouraged myself, I am satisfied with my state of mind," said Djokovic
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Djokovic, who has advanced to the French Open quarter-finals or better every year since 2010, will face Spain's 63rd-ranked Roberto Carballes Baena for a place in the last 32.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka, a semi-finalist in 2023, over-powered Russian teenager Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2 in just 68 minutes under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier as heavy rain caused a five-hour delay to action around the grounds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm trying to do well on clay, it is tough conditions here but I enjoy playing here and I'm just trying to bring my best tennis every time -- whatever the surface," said Sabalenka.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There was better luck for Andreeva's younger sister Mirra, who went to the fourth round as a 16-year-old in 2023.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She swept past Emina Bektas of the United States in straights sets.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Two-time runner-up Casper Ruud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to Roland Garros, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Frenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Baptist University is hosting a conference called FoodMed, which will look at ways of better utilising the heritage of Chinese medicine.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Baptist University academic says he hopes a framework can be established on promoting "food as medicine" in the primary healthcare system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The university is hosting a two-day conference called FoodMed. Terence Lau, the university's Interim Chief Innovation Officer and chair of the conference, said Chinese medicine used many herbal components that people also consumed as food, such as ginseng.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, he was asked about the relationship to medicine, especially as there had previously been controversies in Hong Kong over naturopathic - or so-called holistic - treatments.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We can enhance primary health by alleviating a lot of unhealthy conditions and food can also provide a lot of benefits for chronic diseases," he said. "We are not trying to replace the traditional, or western, medicine doctors. But I think it's another approach to enhance people's health."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Professor Lau also called for the greater use of technology in the field, especially when it came to data collection. He said Chinese medicine had a lot of heritage and the conference would be looking at better ways to utilise this.

    Trump lawyers wrap up defence in hush money case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Trump lawyers wrap up defence in hush money case" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755118_1_20240529053655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defence lawyers in Donald Trump's hush money trial made their final pitch to the jury on Tuesday, insisting the first ever criminal prosecution of a former US president was based on "lies."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Less than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate -- for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, when her account of a 2006 sexual encounter could have doomed his 2016 presidential campaign.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is a very dangerous day for America," Trump told reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him. "We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "President Trump is innocent," his defense attorney Todd Blanche told the jury at the start of what he said would be about two-and-a-half hours of closing arguments.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The consequences of the lack of proof you have heard over the last five weeks is simple -- it's a not guilty verdict," Blanche said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He attacked Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, as a liar.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He told you a number of things on that witness stand that were lies, pure and simple," Blanche said. "You cannot convict president Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Then-president Trump was "busy running the country" when the reimbursements were made to Cohen," he said, and he did not inspect all the invoices that came across his desk.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There was no intent to defraud and beyond that there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by president Trump," Blanche said. "He did not commit any crimes."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump had a grim expression as his lawyer spoke, his head tilted as he studied the jurors. He gave a thumbs-up as he left the courtroom during a break but did not address reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prosecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a "clown" and "grubby real estate developer" intent on destroying the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump chose not to testify in his defence -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq crossed 17,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday, boosted by gains in Nvidia, while the S&P 500 closed slightly higher and the Dow slightly lower as Treasury yields rose.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nvidia shares boosted shares of other chip stocks as traders returned from a holiday-extended weekend.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Stocks lost ground in the afternoon as US Treasury yields climbed to multi-week highs after weak debt auctions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 gained 0.03 percent to 5,306, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 percent to 17,019. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 percent to 38,852.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Investors awaited US inflation data this week that could sway expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The US core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report for April is due later this week. The Fed's preferred inflation barometer is expected to hold steady on a monthly basis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 S&P 500 technology led gains among sectors, while healthcare was the biggest decliner.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It’s all about technology and the winners continue to be the winners, specifically Nvidia," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wall Street has been hitting records recently as investors bet the US central bank could kick off interest-rate cuts this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Expectations for the timing of rate cuts have see-sawed, with policymakers wary as data still reflects sticky inflation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The retail sector will also be in focus this week, with several retailers due to report results.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US trading moves to a shorter settlement on Tuesday, which regulators hope will reduce risk and improve efficiency, but is expected to temporarily increase transaction failures for investors. (Reuters)

    Putin warns west of 'serious consequences'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the west not to let Ukraine use their munitions against targets within Russia. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755115_1_20240529005630.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that there would be "serious consequences" if Western countries allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets in Russia, as sought by Kyiv.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin's warning came in response to calls within some Nato members as well as the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg to allow Ukraine to use their arms to step up attacks on Russian soil, in an attempt to end more than two years of fighting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences," Putin said during a visit to Uzbekistan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In Europe, especially in small countries, they should be aware of what they are playing with," he said, noting that many European countries had "small territory" and a "dense population".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "And this factor, which they should keep in mind before they talk about striking deep into Russian territory, is a serious thing," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that even if Ukraine's forces carried out the strikes, responsibility for them would lie with Western suppliers of the weapons.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They want a global conflict," he said. Western countries have long been wary of being deemed a belligerent in the Ukraine conflict as they provide support to Kyiv.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin also said that while he believed Western military instructors were already in Ukraine operating undercover as mercenaries, any move by countries to send them officially would be another "escalation".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ukraine's top commander announced Monday that talks were being held with France on sending military instructors to the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is another step towards a serious conflict in Europe, towards a global conflict," Putin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are specialists there under the guise of mercenaries," he said, adding that "this was nothing new".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said they would be "defeated" by the Russian army, as "we will do what we think is necessary regardless of who is on the territory of Ukraine".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Brussels that European countries were split on sending military instructors to Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Countries including Germany oppose taking a step they fear could potentially drag them closer to direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 EU countries have trained 50,000 Ukrainian troops outside the war-torn country under a bloc-wide mission set up in 2022.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Western allies to provide longer-range missiles and other material for striking deeper into Russia in a bid to cripple its military and industrial capacity.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With the war now in its third year, Ukraine is also pleading for more weapons for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, notably seeking help to address its lack of air defence systems. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis issued an extraordinary apology on Tuesday over his reported use of a gay slur in a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms and he extends his apologies to those who felt offended by the use of a term, reported by others," the Vatican said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During a meeting with more than 250 bishops last week, the 87-year-old pontiff was said to have used an offensive term while expressing his opposition to openly homosexual men joining training colleges for priests, even if they committed to celibacy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to two Italian newspapers, Francis said there was already too much "frociaggine" in seminaries, using an offensive Roman term which translates as "faggotry".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The reports made headlines around the world and drew dismay from both LGTBQ groups and practising Catholics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some commentators suggested the Argentine pope did not know what he was saying.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Vatican statement did not confirm that he used the word but referenced newspaper articles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As he had the opportunity to state on several occasions: 'In the Church there is room for everyone, everyone! Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us'," the statement said. (AFP)

    OpenAI unveils safety and security group

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some critics have raised safety concerns over OpenAI's chatbots as they become increasingly powerful. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755112_1_20240529002543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI has formed a Safety and Security Committee that will be led by board members, including CEO Sam Altman, as it begins training its next artificial intelligence model, the AI startup said on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Directors Bret Taylor, Adam D'Angelo and Nicole Seligman will also lead the committee, OpenAI said on a company blog.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Microsoft-backed OpenAI's chatbots with generative AI capabilities, such as engaging in human-like conversations and creating images based on text prompts, have stirred safety concerns as AI models become powerful.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The new committee will be responsible for making recommendations to the board on safety and security decisions for OpenAI's projects and operations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "A new safety committee signifies OpenAI completing a move to becoming a commercial entity, from a more undefined non-profit-like entity," said D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "That should help streamline product development while maintaining accountability."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Former Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, who were leaders of OpenAI's Superalignment team, which ensured AI stays aligned to the intended objectives, left the firm earlier this month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 OpenAI had disbanded the Superalignment team, earlier in May, less than a year after the company created it, with some team members being reassigned to other groups, CNBC reported days after the high-profile departures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The committee's first task will be to evaluate and further develop OpenAI’s existing safety practices over the next 90 days, following which it will share recommendations with the board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After the board's review, OpenAI will publicly share an update on adopted recommendations, the company said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world experienced an average of 26 more days of extreme heat over the last 12 months that would probably not have occurred without climate change, a report said on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Heat is the leading cause of climate-related death and the report further points to the role of global warming in increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather around the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For this study, scientists used the years 1991 to 2020 to determine what temperatures counted as within the top 10 percent for each country over that period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Next, they looked at the 12 months to May 15, 2024, to establish how many days over that period experienced temperatures within -- or beyond -- the previous range.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Then, using peer-reviewed methods, they examined the influence of climate change on each of these excessively hot days.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They concluded that "human-caused climate change added -- on average, across all places in the world -- 26 more days of extreme heat than there would have been without it".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The report was published by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the World Weather Attribution scientific network and the non-profit research organisation Climate Central.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 2023 was the hottest year on record, according to the European Union's climate monitor, Copernicus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Already this year, extreme heatwaves have afflicted swathes of the globe from Mexico to Pakistan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The report said that in the last 12 months some 6.3 billion people -- roughly 80 percent of the global population -- experienced at least 31 days of what is classed as extreme heat.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In total, 76 extreme heatwaves were registered in 90 different countries on every continent except Antarctica.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Five of the most affected nations were in Latin America.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The report said that without the influence of climate change, Suriname would have recorded an estimated 24 extreme heat days instead of 182; Ecuador 10 not 180; Guyana 33 not 174, El Salvador 15 not 163; and Panama 12 not 149.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "(Extreme heat) is known to have killed tens of thousands of people over the last 12 months but the real number is likely in the hundreds of thousands or even millions," the Red Cross said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Flooding and hurricanes may capture the headlines but the impacts of extreme heat are equally deadly," said Jagan Chapagain, secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for efforts to promote high-quality and sufficient employment, and to further boost employment through development.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi made the remarks on Monday while presiding over a Politburo group study session, Xinhua news agency reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "[We should] insist that employment of young people including college graduates is a top priority," Xi told the session. China is expected to see over 11.7 million college graduates this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The president also said measures should be taken to promote the employment of migrant workers, stabilise the number and income of people who were lifted out of poverty, and provide more help to groups that find it difficult to secure employment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also called for efforts to deepen the reform of employment systems and mechanisms, and protect the rights and interests of workers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China created 4.36 million new urban jobs in the first four months, human resources ministry data showed, 36 percent of its annual job creation target. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority on Tuesday said a four-year-old girl suffered a cardiac arrest after receiving stitches in Yan Chai Hospital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authority said the medical staff resuscitated her and that she regained a heartbeat 18 minutes later, but remains in a coma and in critical condition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was sent to Yan Chai Hospital’s accident and emergency department after sustaining a head injury in a fall on Saturday night. The child had a slight fever and medical staff put stitches into a two-centimetre gash in her head.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The hospital's chief executive, Ian Cheung, said this incident was "very rare", adding the staff had followed procedures when giving her three stitches.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It was a very short process... She cried during the first stitch, but she quieted down during the second and the third stitches," he told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We checked her after completing the process because it's over so quickly, and we found out she didn't have a pulse. So we must find experts to give us advice on why this happened."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The girl was then transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at Princess Margaret Hospital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fong Nai-chung, chief of service for paediatrics in both Princess Margaret and Yan Chai hospitals, said she suffered from ischemic encephalopathy, which meant her brain was injured because blood supply decreased when her heart stopped.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Currently, she is on a ventilator, given heart medication and drugs to control seizures and swelling in the brain. These are also coupled with antibiotics and nutrient injections. Our team will monitor her situation closely and provide the most appropriate treatment for her," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hospital Authority said it is upset by the incident, and is providing assistance to the girl's family.

    Six arrested over 'seditious posts'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police say the case relates to seditious posts published on social media. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755055_1_20240528184935.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were arrested on Tuesday under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, with police saying the group is suspected of "offences in connection with seditious intention".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 National security police accused a woman who was on remand of taking advantage of "a forthcoming sensitive date" and publishing seditious posts on social media anonymously, with the help of five others.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, was one of those arrested.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The suspects, aged between 37 and 65, were arrested by national security police at various locations in the city, including the Tai Lam Centre for Women.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Social media posts since April were allegedly aimed at inciting public hatred of the central government, the SAR administration and the judiciary, and were allegedly designed to encourage people to organise or take part in illegal activities, police said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Electronic devices suspected of having been used to publish posts with seditious intention were among items seized during the operation, the force added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 These are the first arrests made under Hong Kong's homegrown national security legislation that came into effect in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A police spokesperson noted that people found guilty of committing offences in connection with seditious intention face a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The spokesperson also warned that people who try to endanger national security should not think they can avoid police investigation by making anonymous comments online.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The allegations (against) this group of people are using a Facebook page on social media to advocate hatred against our central government, the Hong Kong government and also our judiciary,” Tang told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “They're relating to a forthcoming sensitive date. But I would like to reiterate that... the main crime is not about the subject. It's about their utilising the subject during which they incited hatred against the central government and our Hong Kong government and the judiciary. This incitement of hatred is the cause of the crime.”

    Fencing four hope to bring HK good results

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The four fencers representing the SAR in the Olympics on Tuesday said they hope to use the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait next month as final preparation for Paris in July.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Star fencer Vivian Kong has won several large events, including the Fujairah Women's Epee World Cup 2024 and the Barcelona Women's Epee World Cup 2024, but has yet to win an Olympic medal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said she still has to give it her all, even though this will be her third Games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's like psychologically and mentally [where] I need to be calm and that's like usually the hardest part when we compete especially in foreign competitions. Technically, it's all my coach [Octavian Zidaru]. He knows every action we work on," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He's always like this one higher, this one lower, this one point more accurately, so there's always something wrong with my actions, so I have to work hard to make him happy."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Olympic gold-medallist Edgar Cheung said he doesn't want to let the pressure to win another medal affect his performance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the competition in Kuwait will give him another practice opportunity before the Games, adding that it's vital to perform to the best of his ability and enjoy the competition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Of course, there are challenges but for me, it is like preparing well for myself, and give all my best, and afterwards, we will see what happens. I think me and Vivian had quite a good experience about the Olympics," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "For the two of the rest, one is my ex-roommate so we are friends. We have been talking about the Olympics, how it is and I just told them to enjoy and to have fun."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Epee fencer Cedric Ho said he is excited to have booked his place in Paris.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Though I'm really excited, I do want to bring that energy down a little and enter the Olympics with a calm mindset," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I will be going to the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait at the end of June, and those results will determine our rankings in the Olympics. I will use that competition as a prep for the Games."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As for Daphne Chan, she said she doesn't have specific expectations from the Games, and is just looking forward to learning from her teammates and staying focused for Paris.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers will soon be able to watch a series of special RTHK Olympics-related programmes in Putonghua, Cantonese and English, including some produced on the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sign language and audio description services will also be available.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This comes after RTHK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Guangdong Radio and Television on Monday, and another with Beijing Radio and Television Station (BRTV) on Tuesday, to jointly deliver news related to the Paris Olympics and Paralympics 2024.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China Media Group is also a cooperation partner.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some of the special shows will be produced locally, featuring issues related to Environmental, social, and governance, to echo the Paris Games’ goal of being the greenest Games ever.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There will also be a raft of programmes produced by the Guangdong and Beijing TV stations, with content ranging from local culture, behind-the-scenes stories of the Winter Olympics 2022, as well as individual athletes’ preparations for this summer's Games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a signing ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the programmes will promote a sports culture in Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “This allows all Hongkongers to cheer for athletes from the national team and Team Hong Kong, while uniting all sectors of the society and encouraging residents to do more exercise,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Meanwhile, we hope that the broadcast of the Paris Olympics and the Paralympics Games 2024 will further spur local catering and retail activities, boosting the local economy by creating a ‘multiplier effect’,” he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li Xiulei, deputy chief editor of BRTV, said the cooperation between Hong Kong and Beijing marks the beginning of a deepening of cultural exchanges.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I hope Hong Kong viewers and listeners could learn about Beijing’s profound culture via the programmes by BRTV,” she said, adding that she hopes the two cities will further strengthen collaboration to provide more diversified programmes for residents.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hong Kong government has purchased broadcasting rights for this year's Olympics, allowing RTHK, TVB, Hoy TV and ViuTV to show the Games on their free-to-air channels.

    Increase penalties over illicit cigarettes: customs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Customs has recorded over 7,000 cases related to illicit cigarette activities in the first five months.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Tuesday proposed increasing the penalties for crimes involving illicit cigarettes, after they detected a 50 percent rise in cases this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Customs recorded over 7,000 cases in the first five months, which was a 54 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An assistant customs commissioner, Lai Chi-wing, said most illicit cigarettes were shipped into Hong Kong before the pandemic, but more travellers had been bringing in illicit cigarettes into the city after the border reopened.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The total number of incoming passengers bringing in dutiable cigarettes was over 5,000 [from February to May], so this is not a small figure. So we try to target these incoming passengers bringing in small amount of cigarettes," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials recommended increasing the maximum imprisonment term from two to seven years, and to double the maximum fine to HK$2 million.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They also proposed including the offence of illicit cigarettes under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance, as cases may involve syndicates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Customs proposed that cigarettes being sold lower than the tax amount should be presumed as duty-not-paid goods.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It pointed out there were packs of cheap white cigarettes being sold at HK$40 in the market, which was even lower than the required tax of HK$66 for a packet of 20 cigarettes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday called on authorities to speed up its long-standing plan to turn south Lantau into a tourist spot, with some urging the government to make it a high-end vacation resort.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials told a Legco meeting they were collecting the public's views over the next two months on building a pier and accommodation facilities in Cheung Sha, as well as setting up a water sports centre at Hong Kong’s longest beach there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the proposed South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor plan, an uphill chairlift would also be built in Cheung Sha, and the neighbouring areas of Shek Pik, Shui Hau and Pui O would get walkways around a reservoir, along the shore of a sand flat, or on treetops.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But legislators like Andrew Lam said the government had earlier made such plans in its blueprint to develop Lantau back in 2017, and had asked authorities to act on them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Undersecretary for Development David Lam said the government would try to build more parking spaces, family playgrounds and a visitor’s centre in the area in a year or two.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The undersecretary said preliminary assessments on the environment and infrastructure had shown the proposals would not have any adverse impact on south Lantau.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said it is estimated the corridor would attract 4,000 to 6,000 more visitors a day during holidays.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We will have to access the reception capacity of Lantau as a whole because it wouldn't be ideal if too many visitors are going to the area and destroy the local characteristics. So maybe we'll implement an online booking system," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said authorities could transform south Lantau into an upscale vacation destination featuring high-end resort hotels.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam said authorities were liaising with developers and had received some positive response.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed "grave concern" over Israel's military operations in Rafah, where an Israeli strike killed dozens in a displaced persons camp.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China urged "all parties to protect civilians and civilian facilities".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing also said it "strongly urges Israel to listen to the appeals of the international community and to stop its attacks on Rafah".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China has been calling for an immediate ceasefire since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war in October last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Additionally, President Xi Jinping has called for an international peace conference to resolve the fighting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting later on Tuesday over Israel's operations in the southern Gaza border city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement centre, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation. Israel said it was looking into the "tragic accident".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,200 civilians.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry run by Hamas. (AFP)

    Douyin to tighten regulations for viral posts

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Douyin says it guides creators to record "true, good lives". File photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755047_1_20240528163706.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese social media giant Douyin has said it will start cracking down on posts that use so-called "hot events" to boost views, after state media reported that accounts for multiple influencers known for showing off their lavish lifestyles had been blocked.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement released on Monday, Douyin said these videos use scenarios, such as staged medical crises or domestic disputes, in a bid to go viral.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Douyin guides creators to record true, good lives," the company added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It comes after Global Times newspaper earlier this month said the Douyin account belonging to content creator Wang Hongquan – which had more than 4.3 million followers – was no longer accessible last week amid a crackdown on influencers who flaunt their wealth online.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wang's Douyin page had featured videos where he showed off designer outfits, first-class flights and his jade jewellery collection.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A screenshot of his Douyin profile page showed that the account had been banned for violating the platform's regulations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chinese social media platforms, including Tencent, Kuaishou, Weibo and Little Red Book, had jointly issued a statement on May 15 saying they will crack down on those showing off their wealth, according to Global Times.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Douyin said they removed over 4,701 pieces of inappropriate content and closed 11 accounts from May 1 to 7, while Little Red Book cleaned up more than 4,200 posts and shut 383 accounts in two weeks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, "Sister Abalone", a woman who filmed her elaborately decorated mansion and was regularly seen dripping with diamond and pearl necklaces, also appeared to have been targeted, with her videos on the YouTube-like Bilibili site no longer visible.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And "Young Master Bo", an influencer who filmed himself test-driving Rolls-Royces and splurging on rare Hermes Birkin bags, was also missing from Douyin, with his account showing an error message that said he had "violated relevant laws and regulations". (Additional reporting by AFP)

    India, Bangladesh count the cost of killer cyclone

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 12 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse," the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There were no immediate details of the number trapped.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Weather experts in Bangladesh said the deadly cyclone was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting they'd experienced, blaming climate change for the shift.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In terms of its land duration, it is one of the longest in the country's history," Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department told AFP, adding it had battered the country for more than 36 hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In contrast, cyclone Aila, which hammered Bangladesh in 2009, lasted around 34 hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slow-moving – and therefore longer-lasting – storms bring greater destruction.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I've seen many storms in my life but nothing like this cyclone," said Asma Khatun, an 80-year-old widow who lives with her son, a fisherman in Bangladesh's hard-hit coastal town of Patuakhali.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Before, the storm came and went away... now it doesn't seem to go away. The incessant pouring and heavy wind kept us stuck for days."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rahman said the cyclone triggered massive rains, with some cities receiving at least 200 millimetres.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Storm surges breached multiple embankments, meaning seawater flooded into farmland, damaged freshwater fish farms common along the coast, or corrupted drinking water.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bangladesh's state minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman said 3.75 million people had been affected by the cyclone, more than 35,000 homes were destroyed, and another 115,000 damaged. (Reuters/AFP)

    Shanghai rolls out measures to boost property market

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Shanghai have unveiled a set of measures to provide further targeted support for homebuyers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The nine measures unveiled on Monday aim to meet the diversified living needs of residents, Xinhua news agency reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They include easing home-purchase restrictions further for non-Shanghai residents and divorced couples, and allowing families with two or more children to purchase an additional home.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shanghai also said it would reduce the minimum down payment for commercial housing mortgages to 20 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The announcement followed similar moves in major cities such as Hangzhou and Xi'an this month, reducing purchase restrictions for first-time buyers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many mainland cities had imposed restrictions and tough credit requirements on home purchases well over a decade ago in an effort to tamp down soaring prices and speculation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But they are now reversing those policies in a bid to stem an economic slump characterised by a debt crisis among developers, low demand and falling prices. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong triathlete Jason Ng has beaten Ayan Beisenbayev from Kazakhstan for the remaining spot in Paris Olympic qualification reserved for the highest-ranked Asian nation or region that hadn't already made it through to the Games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ng had been going neck to neck against Beisenbayev for the remaining place, after Japan's top three athletes secured spots based on individual Olympic rankings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During the weekend's Asia Triathlon Cup, Ng was disqualified for wearing a helmet during the running portion of the competition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, given that Beisenbayev failed to finish on the podium to accumulate the points he needed, Hong Kong were able to win a spot in Paris.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ng secured the 33rd ticket for the SAR delegation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he expects half of Hong Kong's companies would be using artificial intelligence by the end of this year, adding that technology and innovation is the government's priority.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at the UBS Asian Investment Conference, Lee said the SAR understands the important role technology plays in the future of investment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Thanks to the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong continues to evolve. As we embrace new technologies and sustainable practices, we strengthen our position as the foreign investment gateway to mainland China, and as the conduit for mainland enterprises to invest in the world," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Technology and innovation is a central priority of the Hong Kong SAR government. That includes applying AI technology to fast track our smart city and digital government ambitions."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee added the government was launching more than 100 digital government and smart-city initiatives and expediting the establishment of an AI Supercomputing Centre in Cyberport.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics clinched the Eastern Conference championship on Monday with a 105-102 win over the Indiana Pacers, sweeping the series 4-0 and booking a spot in the NBA Finals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Celtics will face the winner of the Western Conference finals, where the Dallas Mavericks hold a 3-0 over the Minnesota Timberwolves ahead of Tuesday's game four.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Celtics win in Indianapolis was their seventh straight in the post-season but they left it late against a Pacers team again without injured star guard Tyrese Haliburton.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jaylen Brown once again proved decisive.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He hit a step through to level at 102-102 with 2:40 left in the fourth, then superbly rose to block Andrew Nembhard at the rim.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With 45 seconds remaining Brown found Derrick White in the corner who sank the three-point jumper that ultimately clinched the game.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nembhard, who had 24 points, 10 assists and six rebounds for the Pacers, missed a three-pointer with 33 seconds left which would have tied the game.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Brown led Boston's scoring with 29 points and Jayson Tatum had 26 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Celtics return to the finals two years after losing to the Golden State Warriors as they search for their first NBA title since 2008.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was the third time in the four series games that Indiana had lost after holding leads or being tied in the final minute of a game.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Expectations will be raised for next year, which is good," said Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are challenges to meet over the summer for our guys to get better, all of us involved need to get better," he added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green groups disagreed with the government's decision to postpone waste charging indefinitely, but the environment minister stressed officials had not given up on the policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The administration announced on Monday it would not implement the pay-as-you-throw scheme on August 1 as originally planned, citing concerns among residents and the limited coverage of recycling facilities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Tuesday, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said it was not suitable to set a date for the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our society has to be mature enough to accept this approach. Also, when the policy is introduced, its design has to be easy and accepted by the public, and be straight forward for frontline workers," Tse told an RTHK programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In the coming year, we will of course expand our efforts on waste reduction and recycling, as well as promotion. On the other hand, we will also look at how we can enhance the scheme, gauge public sentiment, and see whether we have the conditions to introduce waste charging. We are not giving up on this concept."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tse said the government might roll out waste charging in phases if officials decided to re-introduce the scheme in future, so that it's more easily accepted by the public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Edwin Lau, the founder and executive director of The Green Earth, told the same programme that the decision in postponing the scheme reflected a lack of faith and determination in the administration.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said while the government's poll showed a majority of residents opposed waste charging, he understood the business sector was ready for the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Many large companies and organisations said they had been prepared and had no issue [with the policy]. I have also asked some from the middle class, they said [paying] HK$50 a month was a very small amount," Lau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The government appeared to have amplified negative responses to the policy, but did not focus on positive feedbacks."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Wendell Chan from Friends of the Earth called on the government to dig deeper to understand public opinion on the policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "What we need to know is why opinion shifted, what happened there, what caused people to not like this scheme," Chan said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think we went in-depth enough, in terms of analysing these problems in order to tackle them. The problem is that the government, right now, is way too willing to back down instead of trying to resolve these issues."

 Four people were killed and another was receiving intensive medical treatment after a residential building partially collapsed in Anhui province on Monday afternoon.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to Xinhua News Agency, the west side of the five-storey building in the city of Tongling collapsed at around 1.40pm.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Four bodies were recovered following a search-and-rescue operation, local authorities said, while a girl, 12, was plucked to safety and receiving medical treatment.

    Security still a factor in trilateral talks: academic

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Premier Li Qiang (right), Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (left) and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol hold a press conference.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political academic in Shanghai has described trilateral talks between China, Japan and South Korea as a step in the right direction, although he said the security stances of Tokyo and Seoul may be problematic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Professor Josef Gregory Mahoney from East China Normal University said Japan and South Korea had recently been gravitating towards the Aukus defence pact - between the US, Australia and the UK - and it remained to be seen how things would play out after the US presidential election later this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The main issues of whether Japan and South Korea will continue to draw closer to the US, as we've seen, especially since President Yoon took office in Seoul and whether or not we'll see a change in the US presidency this November and how that would affect US strategic positioning where we've seen, of course, Biden playing a very powerful role in advancing the Indo-Pacific concept and moving forward with Aukus," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "And, of course, we've had recent reports that South Korea and Japan will be cooperating with Aukus, which most people interpret as a new sort of Pacific-based Nato that is the foremost part of American containment strategies."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two-day talks in Seoul, which began on Sunday, were the first direct dialogue between the three countries in more than four years with Premier Li Qiang meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Professor Mahoney also said he did not think a free trade pact would emerge soon, despite the countries agreeing to work towards one.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, called for more recycling points. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754977_1_20240528075506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There has been a mixed reaction to the news that the government has indefinitely postponed the roll-out of its waste charging scheme. Some lawmakers say they back the decision, noting that a trial had found many concerns about the pay-as-you-throw initiative. Others insisted that Hong Kong still has to find ways to better manage its waste.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, says a delay is reasonable. But he says officials should now get back to the original point of the scheme and better promote recycling.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Waste charging is only one of the many ways to reduce waste and waste treatment is a worldwide problem," he said. "One important thing is that we have to put more recycling facilities, more recycling points and shops so that we can push up recycling."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said she supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”. But Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.

    Egypt says soldier shot dead near Rafah crossing

<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of Egypt's security forces was killed in a shooting incident near the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and an investigation is under way, Egypt's military spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's military had earlier said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "A few hours ago (Monday), a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians," the Israeli military said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Later on Monday, Egypt warned against compromising the security and safety of its security forces, a high-level source told Egypt's state-linked Al Qahera News, adding that Egypt would take necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An Egyptian soldier stationed on a watchtower had reacted to seeing an armoured vehicle carrying Israeli troops cross a boundary line near the border while the soldiers pursued and killed several Palestinians, two Egyptian security sources said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The soldier opened fire and Israeli forces fired back, killing him, the sources said, sparking an exchange of gunfire between the two sides. Several Israeli soldiers were wounded and the force fell back, and one Egyptian was wounded, the sources said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel seized control of the Rafah border crossing from the Gaza side of the border earlier this month as it stepped up its military offensive in the area, drawing strong criticism from Egypt.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Egypt is concerned that Palestinians could be displaced from southern Gaza by the offensive, and has also repeatedly accused Israel of holding up deliveries of humanitarian aid to the territory, which Israel denies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and have cooperated closely on security issues around the borders between Israel, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, and the Gaza Strip. They jointly upheld a blockade of Gaza after Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British lawmaker Lucy Allan, who had said she would not stand in the national election, was suspended from the governing Conservative Party on Monday after endorsing the candidate for the right-wing Reform UK party.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This marks another setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has been on the campaign trail since calling a general election last week. Dozens of Conservative lawmakers have already said they won't be standing in the July 4 election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Allan, 59, who was the Conservative member of parliament (MP) for the English town of Telford and has been an MP for nine years, said on social media that she was supporting Reform's Alan Adams to be the constituency's next MP.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Conservative Party spokesperson said she had been suspended from the party with "immediate effect," adding that "a vote for Reform is a vote for (opposition Labour leader) Keir Starmer."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A poll conducted by More in Common published a day after Sunak called the election on Wednesday showed 44 percent support for Labour and 27 percent for the Conservatives, with the right-wing Reform UK party at 10 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier this year, former Conservative Party Deputy Chairman Lee Anderson, who was suspended from the party over accusations of Islamophobia, defected to Reform, which has Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage as its honorary president. (Reuters)

    Israel launches probe as leaders condemn Rafah strike

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong," he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on "precise intelligence", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 French President Emmanuel Macron said he was "outraged" over Israel's latest attacks. "These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians," he said on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling against action in Rafah must be respected. (Reuters)

    Nadal crashes out in likely French Open farewell

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal salutes the Roland Garos fans after what could be his final French Open match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754957_1_20240528005047.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafa Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said its attempt to launch a new military reconnaissance satellite ended in failure on Monday when a newly developed rocket engine exploded in flight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The attempt came just hours after Pyongyang issued a warning that it would try to launch a satellite by June 4, in what would have been its second spy satellite in orbit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead, the launch became the nuclear-armed North's latest failure, following two other fiery crashes last year. It successfully placed its first spy satellite in orbit in November.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage," the deputy director general of North Korea's National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An intial analysis suggested that the cause was a newly developed liquid fuel rocket motor, but other possible causes were being investigated, the report said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials in South Korea and Japan had earlier reported that the launch seemed to have failed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10.44pm, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 JCS said it had detected a large amount of debris from the rocket in the sea just two minutes after launch, however.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The object launched by North Korea disappeared over the Yellow Sea, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government presumes nothing had entered the space.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “These launches are in violation of relevant security council resolutions and are a serious matter concerning the safety of our people," Hayashi said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday were largely sympathetic towards the decision to suspend the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking to reporters after a meeting at the Legislative Council, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the ultimate goal of the scheme was to promote recycling and reduce waste, but he acknowledged the public had misconceptions about the plan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The public misunderstood that this whole thing is actually tantamount to a poll tax, which means that everyone has to start paying more taxes because everyone needs to generate garbage," he explained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Most people are not aware of the fact that, no - that is not the end game. The end game is to reduce wastage generation. To do that, you need to do the wastage collection, the separation, so that some can be recycled. The whole world is doing that, and I cannot believe Hong Kong should just surrender and forget it."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We insist the policy should be carried out because it is environmental protection. We feel disappointed that [over] the last two years the government [had inadequate] preparation to implement the policy," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Quat urged the government to continue educating the public and to provide support for the city's recycling industry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think now is a very good timing for the government to promote recycling and the reduction of waste. Because going through all this education process, a lot of citizens think that they support environmental protection and they want to participate in waste reduction," she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Quat also suggested the government introduce additional incentives, such as a rewards scheme, to encourage people to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of the Japanese anime character Doraemon can now catch the time-travelling robot cat on some trains, as well as at the Siu Hong Light Rail stop.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Leading up to the Doraemon exhibition on July 13 at the Avenue of Stars, the MTR Corporation has put up posters and decorations from the series at the stop, and has transformed some Light Rail, East Rail Line and Airport Express trains with the Doraemon theme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The trains are covered in Doraemon blue, while the doors are pink to depict the "Anywhere Door" portal to any destination.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 S K Lam, speaking for the organisers of the Doraemon event, said he hopes people can enjoy the iconic character during their journeys.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think Doraemon is everyone's friend. We want to bring more joy and more creativity to people," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "MTR is one of the important daily [modes of] transportation in Hong Kong, so when people can see it everyday, we are happy to share the joy with everybody. Of course, people can also catch the train to our exhibition."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested 20 people after a gang allegedly gave foreign domestic helpers cash to open bank accounts used to process HK$10 million in criminal proceeds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among the suspects picked up on suspicion of conspiracy to launder money were 14 Indonesian migrant workers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A helper is suspected of having acted as an intermediary for a syndicate to recruit others, with meetings arranged at locations such as parks, fast food restaurants and hotel rooms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers on Monday said they believe the helpers were paid between HK$1,000 and HK$2,500 for opening accounts, which were then managed by the syndicate.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "For foreign domestic workers, the amount [allegedly] paid is relatively high compared to their salaries. That also was the main incentive for them to [allegedly] sell their bank accounts," said Chief Inspector So Chi-bing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bank accounts are suspected of being linked to 39 cases of fraud involving losses of HK$5.4 million, police added.

    Taxi union demands ban on unlicensed ride services

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754886_1_20240527155742.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport workers’ union on Monday called on the government to ban unlicensed ride-hailing services and address the plight of the taxi trade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Motor Transport Workers General Union said cab drivers have suffered a more than 30 percent drop in business in recent years due to competition with illegal taxi services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Videos circulating online appear to show cabbies posing as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chief Executive John Lee has urged people to leave such matters to law enforcement agencies, but the union’s principal vice-chairperson, Chong Wing-tak, said taxi drivers are not convinced.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Why do drivers perform sting operations? It's because of a lack of enforcement action by the government, transport authorities, and the police. We have endured this for more than ten years. We can't bear it anymore, so some drivers have organised these sting operations," he told a press conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Harry Ho, the union's director of the taxi driver branch, described illegal cab drivers as "irresponsible", noting that any injuries that occur during unlicensed ride-hailing services are not covered by insurance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In July, the Transport and Logistics Bureau is expected to report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to discuss speeding up talks for a trilateral free trade agreement, according to a joint statement released on Monday following their three-way summit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries also reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula at the ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting in Seoul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The summit brought together Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries announced they would keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a trilateral free trade deal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li said they had agreed not to turn "economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoon said the leaders had "decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After their talks, Li, Kishida and Yoon joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade among the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li called on relevant parties to exercise restraint.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit, a move that violates United Nations sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would undermine regional and global peace and stability.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li also said China, Japan and South Korea should properly handle sensitive issues and differences, and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The trilateral cooperation system should be strengthened. We have decided to hold trilateral summits on a regular basis," Yoon said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace, and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral meeting. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also highlighted the limited coverage of recycling facilities, pointing out that the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheuk also said the scheme had increased the workload and pressure on cleaners.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that Hong Kong's economic recovery had not lived up to expectations and the implementation of the scheme could have a negative impact on businesses, particularly in the catering sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheuk also addressed the misconception that the government's aim with the waste charging scheme was to generate more revenue. He clarified that the primary objective of the scheme was to improve waste management practices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In light of these factors, the government had taken the decision to shelve the waste charging scheme, he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, he stressed the government remained committed to improving waste management and recycling practices in Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the government would step up publicity work to raise awareness of waste management and improve the city’s recycling network.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government plans to report back to Legco on its work by the middle of next year, he said.

    Minimum wage formula not lopsided: labour chief

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun says the administration has to help low-income workers who don't have a lot of bargaining power. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754864_1_20240527142045.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Monday brushed aside concerns that a new mechanism for setting the statutory minimum wage was unfair to employers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier this month, the Executive Council approved recommendations to review the minimum wage annually instead of every two years. There would also be a new formula for calculating the hourly pay rate, which bars any reduction.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmakers representing the business sector said the new mechanism only focuses on employees and gives workers the false hope of an annual pay rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun, in response, said there is a need to help 17,000 low-income workers, who only account for 0.6 percent of the workforce.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They have very little bargaining power under the market mechanism. There are a lot of constraints on these workers, be it their abilities and other reasons, it is difficult for them to earn a decent pay," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We want to reassure them that their wages would only go up rather than down. If they have to worry about the prospects of a wage cut, then it would add to their plight."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Papua New Guinea government on Monday said a landslide last Friday buried more than 2,000 people and that it had formally asked for international help.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government figure was around three times more than a United Nations’ estimate of 670.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Centre said the landslide “buried more than 2,000 people alive” and caused “major destruction”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A once-bustling remote hillside village in Enga province was almost wiped out when a chunk of Mount Mungalo collapsed in the early hours of Friday morning, burying scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The United Nations said the number of possible deaths could change as rescue efforts were expected to continue for days. (Agencies)

    Braves' Acuña out for season with torn knee ligament

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Atlanta Braves star outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. is out for the remainder of the season after suffering a complete tear of the ACL in his left knee on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acuña, the reigning National League MVP, injured the knee in the first inning of Sunday afternoon's 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates. Despite telling reporters that he did not think he tore the ligament, Acuña underwent an MRI exam and the Braves announced the results late Sunday night.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 26-year-old will undergo surgery at a later date, the team said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acuña led off Sunday's game with a double to right-centre field off Pirates left-hander Martin Perez. He made a move toward third base with Marcell Ozuna batting and fell awkwardly to the ground.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He remained on the ground for several minutes before slowly limping off the field. Jarred Kelenic replaced Acuña in the Atlanta lineup.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I saw the catcher throwing the ball back to the pitcher very slow," Acuña said through an interpreter. "I was timing that so I could steal third. But in that moment, he threw it hard. So I had to come back, and that's when I felt it."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Braves manager Brian Snitker called Acuña's injury "very concerning" before the results of his testing came in.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acuña tore the ACL in his right knee on July 10, 2021, and returned 9 1/2 months later early in the 2022 season. He also sprained his left ACL in May 2018 and was sidelined for just more than a month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He finishes his abbreviated seventh MLB season with a .250 batting average, four home runs and 15 RBIs in 49 games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The first player in MLB history to accomplish a 40-home run, 70-steal season, Acuña is a career .289 hitter with 165 homers and 417 RBIs in 722 games. He's a four-time All-Star and was the unanimous NL MVP in 2023. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 66 points and Dallas surged home in a 116-107 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday that gave the Mavericks a 3-0 stranglehold on their NBA Western Conference final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The latest thriller in the series, this time in Dallas, came after the Mavs won games one and two in Minneapolis by a total of four points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a fourth quarter that saw the teams trade the lead seven times, the star Mavs duo spearheaded a closing 12-3 scoring run.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Mavericks will have their first chance to clinch the series when they host game four on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 No team has rallied from 3-0 down to win an NBA playoff series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Doncic and Irving each finished with 33 points, Doncic adding seven rebounds and five assists and Irving producing 14 of his points in the fourth quarter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 P.J. Washington scored 16 points, draining a three-pointer that put Dallas up for good, 107-104, with 3:38 to play.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daniel Gafford blocked three shots for Dallas, including a monster rejection on Mike Conley in the final minute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 26 points, but had just four in the fourth quarter. Anthony Edwards missed all four of his attempts in the fourth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A bruising contest saw the Mavericks lose Dereck Lively early in the second quarter after the rookie reserve took a knee to the back of the head from a leaping Karl-Anthony Towns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The frightening moment brought Mavs coach Jason Kidd out to check on Lively, who had already taken a painful knee to the groin from Towns trying to guard him under the basket. (AFP)

    Evergrande EV unit shares rally after trading resumes

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group rallied as much as 95 percent on Monday morning after the firm resumed trading following a share transfer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company, which is the EV unit of embattled property developer China Evergrande, on Sunday said 29 percent of its shares, or 3.14 billion, were expected to immediately change hands after liquidators reached a preliminary agreement with an unidentified buyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The deal, subject to due diligence, includes an option for the buyer to take an additional 29.5 percent of the shares, or about 3.2 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The market value of the total shares involved is about HK$2.41 billion, based on the HK$0.38 per share before the trading suspension on May 17.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agreement, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday, also includes a possible credit line to be arranged by the buyer to finance the company’s ongoing operations and the development of its electric vehicle businesses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares of the EV unit rallied to HK$0.74 per share shortly after its trading resumption.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EV maker is faced with a severe shortage of capital, with its Tianjin factory having ceased production at the beginning of the year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It has been struggling since its parent firm got sucked into a property crisis in China in 2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trading in the shares of Evergrande remains suspended.

    Divided views on future of waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opinion remained split on the best way forward for a citywide waste charging scheme, with some lawmakers urging authorities to shelve the plan and green groups calling for a timeline.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sources said the government would shelve the pay-as-you-throw scheme scheduled to take effect from August 1, with lawmakers expected to discuss its fate during a Legco panel meeting on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told an RTHK programme that it was "irresponsible" to put the plan on the back-burner.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We believe this won't help solve the waste problem in Hong Kong. Government departments should take the lead in implementing the waste charging scheme," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Why not do it in phases first, instead of ignoring the issue and pretending that nothing's happened? This will waste a bill that's been on hold for 20 years, and Hong Kong will lose its chance to reduce waste."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But a legislator and industry representatives told an RTHK programme that they welcome the move because the city was simply not ready for the plan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's more appropriate to shelve [the scheme] indefinitely. We should look at it practically. We've come up with a date before, but it didn't happen because the conditions were not met," said DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lau added putting the plan on hold doesn't mean a stop in waste recycling and education work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Simon Wong who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that the catering industry was concerned about manpower shortages and rising operating costs if the scheme went as planned.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Five concern groups - including Civic Exchange, Green Power, Greenpeace, The Green Earth, and Greeners Action - wrote to the chief executive and asked for no more delay in the implementation.
