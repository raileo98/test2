    Plan to upgrade Alibaba's HK listing approved

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shareholders of e-commerce giant Alibaba approved a plan to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Alibaba on Friday said it would upgrade its Hong Kong-listed shares to primary status, opening it up to China's huge army of investors that could potentially rake in billions of dollars for the firm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by shareholders during its annual general meeting on Thursday will provide a much-needed boost to the firm, which has underperformed the market in recent years due to to weak consumption and after a crackdown by Beijing on the tech industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to announce that the voluntary conversion of our secondary listing to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will become effective on August 28, 2024," the company announced on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, which is also listed in New York, had flagged the idea two years ago amid worries about a regulatory drive by US authorities as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington, though that was later put off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba has been primarily traded in New York since 2014 and remained dual-listed after its notable return to Hong Kong through a second listing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the firm's shares in Hong Kong are down about 75 percent from their peak in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A conversion to primary status in Hong Kong could pave way for Alibaba to enter a cross-border scheme that allows investors in Shenzhen and Shanghai to trade Hong Kong-listed shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would open it up to China's more than 200 million investors and could see capital inflows of up to US$19.5 billion in the first six months of inclusion, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba this month reported a 29 percent fall in quarterly profit as it battles sluggish activity among China's consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uncertainty about Alibaba's future development has persisted since Beijing scuttled a planned initial public offering of the company's financial services arm, Ant Group, in late 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancelled listing -- which would likely have been the biggest in history -- was followed a month later by an announcement that Alibaba was under formal investigation in China for alleged monopolistic practices. (AFP)

    Harris secures US presidential nomination

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Kamala Harris called on Americans to join her to “chart a new way forward” as she accepted the Democratic nomination on Thursday, arguing her personal story and her career as a prosecutor made her uniquely qualified to protect their interests and beat Republican candidate Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking the stage to a thunderous standing ovation at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris sought to introduce herself to the American public and outline her vision for leading the nation for the next four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' address in Chicago caps a whirlwind eight weeks in American politics and manifests the stunning reversal of Democratic fortunes just 75 days until Election Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party leaders who had publicly despaired over President Joe Biden's candidacy after his disastrous debate against Trump in June, were jubilant both at the historic nature of Harris' candidacy which has boosted their hopes for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Harris became the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to accept a major party's presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If elected, she would become the first female US president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected. But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris talked about being raised primarily by her mother in San Francisco's East Bay after her parents divorced, and being raised as well by friends and caregivers who were “family by love.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also detailed a key part of her political origin story, when Wanda, her best friend from high school, confided in her that she was being abused by her stepfather and came to live with Harris' family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor. To protect people like Wanda,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outlining her career as a prosecutor, state attorney general, senator and now vice president, Harris said, “My entire career I’ve only had one client: the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said Trump has only ever acted in the interests of "the only client he has ever had: himself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she took the stage, she saw a sea of female delegates and Democratic supporters wearing white — the colour of women’s suffrage — the movement that culminated with American women securing the right to vote in 1920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also pledged to get a Gaza ceasefire deal completed and said as US president she would stand with Ukraine and not "cozy up" to dictators like Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done." (Agencies)

    'Replace Covid facilities with carpark at cruise port'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jeff Bent has revised his earlier forecast and says Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767319_1_20240823104145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday called for the government to remove unused Covid facilities near the site and build an open-air carpark to improve transport links to the facility.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jeff Bent, the managing director of World Wide Cruise Terminals, was commenting on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme after the terminal welcomed the only cruise ship to dock there this month, the Norwegian Spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent revised his earlier forecast and said Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we're expecting about 100 total ship calls... The cruise business is going to be slow this year and next, as we work our way out of the post-Covid trough," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used to have a home-based carrier, a cruise line based in Hong Kong that went out of business and Hong Kong saved its air carrier. We did not save our cruise line... We're now sort of dealing with cruise lines that come from time to time and on occasion, but are not year round based here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent said the unused Covid facilities were a "detraction" of the cruise terminal, and the government should remove them and make use of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Where all those Covid facilities are now, it would be quite easy to have a large open-air carpark there. I think at a minimum, that would be a big boon because we know that 45 percent of Hong Kong people who take a cruise have a car. Eighty-five percent of those would like to drive themselves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If those people can drive themselves, then they will not be fighting for a limited taxi supply with the out-of-town guests. So there are some quick fixes that should be put in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government could allow cab drivers to impose a surcharge for pick-ups at the terminal to attract more taxis to the port.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian cyclist Ben O'Connor soloed to a stunning victory in stage six of the Vuelta a España on Thursday, taking the red jersey from three-time winner Primoz Roglic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rider and Gijs Leemreize attacked from a breakaway group before O'Connor later left the Dutchman behind with 27 kilometres to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor opened up a defendable lead of four minutes 51 seconds in the general classification ahead of veteran Roglic, as the peloton came in well over six minutes down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt a little bit in my own world today. I just went for it, I felt today was just a day to seize my opportunity and I laid it all out there," O'Connor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I could win this stage from the start – it's pretty special when you can just go out and crush it like that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor became the fifth Australian to win stages at all three Grand Tours after winning at the Giro in 2020 and at the Tour de France in 2021. (AFP)

    Chelsea give Maresca first win in Conference League

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea secured their first victory under new coach Enzo Maresca with a 2-0 victory over Servette in their Conference League play-off round first leg on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hosts struggled to break down their opponents in the first half at Stamford Bridge before Christopher Nkunku put them in front with a 50th-minute penalty, just his fourth goal for the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guiu somehow contrived to miss an open goal a few minutes later, but Noni Madueke moved Chelsea closer to a group-stage place ahead of next week's second leg by firing home from Enzo Fernandez's pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiemoko Ouattara almost pulled one back for Swiss side Servette late on when his deflected strike hit the crossbar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a welcome win for Chelsea after suffering a 2-0 loss in Maresca's debut game against Manchester City at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Blues are making their return to European competition after finishing sixth in the Premier League last season under Mauricio Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are learning how to manage the game," said Maresca, who led Leicester to promotion to the Premier League last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was important to win the game with nine changes. There were many good things," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a scare for Chelsea, as key player Cole Palmer went down the dug-out holding the back of his leg at full-time after coming on as a second-half substitute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cole felt something but he looks fine. Hopefully it is no problem and he can be available for Sunday's game against Wolves," Maresca said. (AFP)

    Canada to order rail companies to resume operations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Canadian government moved quickly on Thursday to end an unprecedented rail stoppage, announcing it would ask the country's industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order that could come in a few days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Canada's top two railroads had locked out more than 9,000 unionised workers earlier in the day, triggering a simultaneous rail stoppage that business groups said could inflict hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon told reporters he was acting "to ensure that the activities of both of these rail companies immediately resume" and said he was referring the matter to the board for binding arbitration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MacKinnon said he was confident the board would issue a back-to-work order within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I assume that the trains will be running within days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies – Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City – and the Teamsters union blamed each other for the work stoppage after multiple rounds of talks failed to yield an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision marked a change of mind by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which had long made clear its desire to see the matter settled at the bargaining table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We gave negotiations every possible opportunity to succeed ... but we have an impasse here," said MacKinnon. "And that is why we have come to this decision today." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 All three major US stock indexes lost ground on Thursday, weighed by technology shares, as Treasury yields rose on easing recession fears and global central bank officials convened at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The so-called Magnificent Seven megacap growth stocks weighed heaviest on the tech-laden Nasdaq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There doesn't appear to be any kind of clear catalyst as to what's driving this sell-off," Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.

  "People may be trying to square positions a little bit ahead of Nvidia (earnings) next week, or risk-out ahead of (US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell's Jackson Hole speech tomorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Central bank officials from around the world have gathered in Jackson Hole for the annual Economic Symposium. Investors will be laser focused on Powell's address on Friday for clues on the timing and extent of the Fed's policy easing cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell is expected to assure the markets that the Fed will cut rates in September, Ladner said. "He'll be coy with the question about whether it's going to be a 25 or 50 basis point cut, but will probably try to lead the market towards 25."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will say he expects to start slow but will also emphasize that if they do see any further weakness in the labor market they can speed things up," Ladner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News of increasing US jobless claims, following Wednesday's sharply lower benchmark payrolls revision, appear to confirm the labour market is less robust than expected and is gradually softening. This soothed recession fears while bolstering the case for a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September policy meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sentiment was echoed in remarks on Thursday from Kansas City Fed President Frank Schmid, Boston Fed President Susan Collins, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, all of whom indicated that a rate-cutting phase is shortly forthcoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What Fed officials are saying is a rate cut is definitely on the table, but there's still time between now and September and data can move things," Martin said.

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.43 percent, to 40,713. The S&P 500 lost 0.89 percent, at 5,571 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.67 percent to 17,619. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities confirmed late on Thursday that five Chinese nationals were among nine people who died when a small plane crashed minutes after taking off from Bangkok’s main airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports in Thailand say the dead included children aged 12 and 13, as well as three adults in their 40s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other four victims were Thai nationals, including two pilots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok said Thai authorities had confirmed the death of five Chinese nationals, and it was seeking further information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Immigration Department said no SAR residents were involved in the tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports say the jet took off from Bangkok’s main Suvarnabhumi Airport at 2.46pm. Air traffic control lost radio and radar contact with the aircraft 11 minutes later, when it was an estimated 35 kilometres southeast of the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai media said rescuers found no survivors at the crash site in a mangrove swamp in Chachoengsao province about 40 kilometres from the airport. Rescue teams continued their work into the night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cessna Caravan C208B operated by the Thai Flying Service Company had been bound for the coastal province of Krabi. (Additional reporting by AP, Xinhua)

    US top court revives Arizona voter rules

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767277_1_20240823034309.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court on Thursday revived part of an Arizona voter law requiring documented proof of US citizenship to register to vote, in response to a request from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The justices in a 5-4 ruling agreed to reinstate a provision of the law after a federal judge blocked it in response to legal challenges by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration and advocacy groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision comes before the November 5 election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is facing off against Republican former President Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature adopted new restrictions on voter registration in 2022. The law requires applicants who submit a federal registration form to provide evidence of US citizenship to vote in presidential elections or vote by mail in any federal election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter registrants who use a separate, state-created form face even tighter restrictions. Without proof of US citizenship, state applications are rejected in their entirety, and officials who fail to do so face a minor felony charge under the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court's ruling revived the restriction related to the state voter registration form, but kept intact a judicial decision blocking the provision that sought to tighten limits on the federal form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts joined with fellow conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch to grant Republicans' request in part, though Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the entire request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would have denied the request in full. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767274_1_20240823013000.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal on Thursday ratified President Nicolas Maduro's victory in the July 28 presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The supreme tribunal has reviewed material from the electoral authority and agrees that Maduro won the election, court president Caryslia Rodriguez said, adding the decision cannot be appealed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The electoral material assessed is certified unobjectionably and the results of the presidential election of July 28 released by the national electoral council, where Nicolas Maduro was elected president of the republic, are validated," said Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electoral authority has said since the night of the election that Maduro won just over half of votes, though it has not published full tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has published online what it says are 83 percent of voting machine tallies, which give its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez a hearty 67 percent support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Western countries have urged full publication of results, while Russia, China and others have congratulated Maduro on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme court would be in violation of separation of powers rules in the constitution if it were to carry out any electoral functions, thus making its ruling null, the opposition said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ratification gives Maduro, who took office in 2013, another six-year term, set to begin in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president, a long-time ruling party official before he rose to the presidency, had asked the court to verify the results. The court's judges summoned all the candidates to hand over the copies of voting machine tallies they are entitled to by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez did not attend the summons. The opposition says the court, though constitutionally independent, operates as an arm of the ruling party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition's failure to hand over its copies and Gonzalez's non-appearance are "blatant disrespect", Rodriguez said, and exposes him to sanctions, though she did not specify what kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 23 protesters have been killed at anti-government demonstrations since the election, and some 2,400 arrested, according to the United Nations. Maduro says the demonstrators are extremists. (Reuters)

    Indonesia shelves elections shake-up amid protests

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters clash with police outside the Parliament in Jakarta. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767270_1_20240822233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament shelved planned changes to electoral laws on Thursday after protesters in the capital set fires and faced down tear gas and water cannon over legislation they say would weaken opponents of the outgoing president and his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislature, dominated by supporters of outgoing President Joko Widodo and his successor, Prabowo Subianto, was scheduled to vote to reverse changes to election laws made by the constitutional court, a ruling that effectively reopened a chance for a vocal government critic to run in regional elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties backing Prabowo had earlier this week rallied behind a single candidate for the influential post of Jakarta governor, killing off chances of the president-elect's rival, Anies Baswedan, from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anies at the time needed the backing from a party or a coalition of parties with at least 20 percent of seats in the local parliament, under rules for regional elections in place since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tuesday's Constitutional Court ruling had lowered the threshold to under 10 percent, giving Anies a chance to be nominated by the only party that has not named a candidate, PDIP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national parliament had sought to return to the previous threshold, contradicting the country's highest court in a move critics said would favour the outgoing president and his family, and the incoming government, as they consolidate power and freeze out any opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a republic. It's a democracy, but if its leadership is decided by one person, or an oligarchy, we can't accept that," said 29-year-old teacher Afif Sidik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, deputy parliament speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad said that deliberations would be resumed by the incoming parliament, meaning there would be no change for this year's regional elections, scheduled for November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means Anies will be able to seek the Jakarta governor's office if PDIP nominates him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parliament decision came as security forces fired tear gas and water cannon as protesters breached and set ablaze part of the gates of parliament, while demonstrations broke out across the country against the election law changes. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at a hotel in South Korea has killed seven people and injured 12 others, fire authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fire began on the eighth floor of the nine-story hotel in Bucheon, just west of the capital Seoul at around 7.40pm on Thursday, before being put out in about two hours, according to the interior ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven people died, mostly guests, and 12 were sent to hospitals for treatment, including three in critical condition, said Lee Sang-don, an official at the Bucheon fire station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those killed were a couple who jumped out the windows onto an air mattress installed in front of the building, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was unfolded normally but appeared to have flipped over when they jumped down," he told a televised briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities were looking into the exact cause of the incident, adding there were no sprinklers inside, which was not mandatory when the building was completed in 2003, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Lee Sang-min ordered all-out rescue efforts by mobilising all available resources, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 70 vehicles and 160 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, Yonhap news agency said, citing provincial fire authorities.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Thursday said the giant panda twins born a week ago were gradually stabilising and gaining weight, with the animal's iconic black patches starting to show on parts of the cubs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it also said the pair remained fragile and were being monitored by mainland experts and the park's animal care team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said the female cub weighs around 172 grammes and her younger brother about 168 grammes, and black spots were "vaguely visible" on their eyes, ears and shoulders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are both feeding and defecating normally under the assistance of experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. The twin cubs are also displaying healthy appetites by drinking up to 10 grammes of milk per meal, six times per day," Ocean Park said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the two cubs are stabilising, they are still fragile and are under 24-hour intensive care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said caretakers were supporting the mother panda, Ying Ying, with her post-labour recovery, and experts were trying to milk her for the cubs to consume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying has been improving her caring and nursing behaviours, the park added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth to the twins last Thursday, which was also the eve of her 19th birthday, or the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Italian coast guard on Thursday said the body of British tech magnate Mike Lynch was among those recovered off the coast of Sicily from the wreckage of a superyacht.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One woman remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies of Lynch, who had been celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with his family and the people who had defended him at trial in the United States, and five others were recovered by rescue crews following Monday's tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bayesian, a 56-metre British-flagged yacht, went down in a storm early Monday as it was moored about a kilometre offshore. Civil protection officials said they believe the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, and sank quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators are now looking at why the Bayesian sank, killing at least six people. A seventh remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen of the 22 people aboard survived, including a mother who reported holding her one-year-old baby over the waves to save her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers have struggled to find the bodies in the yacht’s hull on the seabed 50 metres underwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would need a crystal ball to know when we'll be able to find the next body," said Luca Cari, spokesperson for the fire rescue service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's very difficult to move inside the wreckage. Moving just one metre can take up to 24 hours,” Cari said. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 It is up to the Hong Kong Jockey Club to call the shots on how to use a parcel of land it owns in upmarket Happy Valley, the government said on Thursday, after the non-profit body was given the green light to redevelop its sports complex there into a residential site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But a lawmaker said the charity and gaming organisation should provide details on the intended use of housing blocks at 48 Shan Kwong Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Buildings Department had in June approved the club's plan for constructing three 21-storey residential buildings with a total gross floor area of nearly 486,000 square feet, as well as a block to offer recreational facilities for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said the site was brought by the body through public auction, and that the lease did not have any restrictions on its land use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jockey Club is not required to apply for modifying its lease or pay a land premium to construct residential buildings on the site," the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the Jockey Club's decision, as a private land owner, whether and when to develop the site for residential purposes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site was occupied by two stable blocks in the 1930s, before it was rezoned for residential purposes in 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had periodically applied to renew the site's use as a recreational facility since then. The sports complex houses facilities such as tennis and squash courts, a golf simulation room, and fitness studios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmaker Andrew Lam noted the organisation owed the general public an explanation on the project, which he said had attracted a lot of attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are guessing [whether] the Jockey Club would be renting [out] the flats or even selling the flats to the general public...it attracts a lot of queries and concerns," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club was recently asked by the Town Planning Board to "actively implement" the zoned use of the site as originally designated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In securing the extension of the temporary planning permit this year, the organisation "had committed to redevelop the site into a residential cum sports complex, subject to further studies to be undertaken".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said he will unveil measures to address substandard living conditions in subdivided flats at the appropriate time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his Facebook page, Lee said he has received a report from a task force looking into subdivided flats, after officials wrapped up their research and gathered views from different stakeholders over the past 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report from the task force includes suggestions for minimum living standards and ways to replace this type of housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an official statement, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the task force, said the government is expected to provide 308,000 public housing units in the upcoming decade and these homes could offer a solution to long-existing subdivided housing issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that his task force will submit a follow-up report within one month, as instructed by the CE.

 China said it firmly opposes any country allowing the Dalai Lama to make visits under any pretext.

  On Wednesday, senior US officials held talks with the Dalai Lama in New York where he was visiting to receive medical treatment. He met with US State Department official Uzra Zeya and White House National Security Council official Kelly Razzouk.

  "China has made solemn protests with the US," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing on Thursday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Walz formally accepted his nomination to be the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate in a keynote address on Wednesday at the party's convention in Chicago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It's the honour of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason -- we love this country," Walz said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Minnesota governor, who was little known in America 15 days ago, acknowledged he had never given such a big speech but said that as a former high school football coach, "I have given a lot of pep talks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd responded with chants of "Coach, Coach, Coach!" Walz brought his plain-speaking style and small-town values to the national stage, joined by a litany of political luminaries and star entertainers on the third night of the Democratic National Convention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said America should be a place where children don't go hungry, healthcare and housing are human rights, "and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom," referring to Republican assaults on abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He spoke of preserving the freedoms that Democrats say are under attack from Trump, who is making his third major-party run for the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said a second Trump White House would serve nobody except the wealthy and most extreme.
  <br/>

    Chinese &amp; Western medicine collab for better care

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in family medicine on Thursday called on people to consult both a family doctor and a Chinese medicine practitioner once a year for regular check ups, adding that preventive care could lessen the burden on medical staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Liberal Party conducted a telephone questionnaire with more than 2,000 people over the past two months, in the hope of strengthening collaboration between Chinese and Western medical practitioners to better serve the public, and 70 percent said they would accept this medical partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Billy Chiu, a member of the party, said this "one plus one is greater than two" method of seeing two different practitioners could increase the chance of catching medical conditions early on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the aim is to do preventive care, so definitely with preventive care doing better, then obviously the percentage [of those] going to hospital will be much lower, so that will lead to less manpower demand inside the hospital," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the Hong Kong government's direction [on developing] the primary care commission and also 18 district health centres, I think we are looking forward to the outcome and also for the efficiency of increasing all these primary care preventive service models so with that, fewer people will go to inpatient [facilities] so the staff, the manpower planning, all this can be reviewed much efficiently."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chiu said that promoting collaboration could also allow for better communication and teamwork between the two medical fields when treating the same patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, I think many people, even including healthcare people, when we are not familiar about, for example, the drug interaction of Western medicine and herbs, so we simply tell people not to mix together or separate by four hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually with more evidence we know that some Chinese medicine and also Western medicine when taken together, we can see the more beneficial effect. Number two, [Chinese medicine] actually alleviates the side effects of some of the Western medicine."

 MTR passengers can ride on a replica of the rail operator's first-generation trains from Thursday, as part of the company's 45th anniversary celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The train will run on various lines until the end of the year and will be showcased at Choi Hung Station on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has the red and white front of the first-generation trains, as well as the MTR logo from back in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inside there are the ball-shaped straphangers of old, and an orange-yellow ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lighting has also been adjusted to a yellowish colour to give passengers a sense that they are travelling back in time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aaron was among hundreds of train enthusiasts who boarded the inaugural train at Choi Hung on Thursday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first time we saw the train we [thought] that it is quite [similar] to what we saw [in] the historical photos," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan told RTHK that the ball-shaped shapehangers felt better on the hand compared to the red-coloured handles used on other trains.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday hailed a cooperation project between Hong Kong and Thailand aimed at promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and green transport in the Southeast Asian country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony to kick off a partnership between the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) and Thai energy company Spark, Chan said that while the SAR is not known for mass EV production, its tech community is able to create innovative solutions for the vehicles and other new energy applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is proud to assist Thailand in its green transformation, using cutting-edge technologies developed by our tech firms, and contributing our know-how, innovation, expertise and experience,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This high-profile, international project is a brilliant showcase of our green technological capabilities. It reinforces Hong Kong's aspirations and prospects to become an international green tech and green finance centre.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the partnership is only the beginning of more collaborations with Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in the green, smart mobility field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC’s CEO Clara Chan noted that the investment is the corporation’s first overseas initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government-owned investment vehicle aspires to help Spark become one of the top three EV charging brands in Thailand by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To recap, as patient capital, the HKIC has been carrying out due mandate, namely to seek reasonable financial return over the medium to long term, and more importantly, to enhance the long term competitiveness and economic vitality of Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clara Chan said the HKIC's investments have been focused on a diversified range of fields, including core technology, biotechnology, new energy and green technology, spanning companies at various stages of development and from around the world.

 Tickets to local demonstrations by mainland Olympians who did well at the Paris Games were all snapped up in a little more than half an hour on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were some 5,000 tickets available for the public to go to two demonstrations on August 31, and a gala show the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The events are part of a three-day visit by the delegation to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people joined an online queue for the HK$20 tickets when they went on sale at 10am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two demonstrations, at Victoria Park Swimming Pool and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, will feature divers, swimmers, gymnasts, as well as table tennis and badminton players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said those who bought the tickets need to collect them at URBTIX outlets or from self-service ticketing kiosks on or before August 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After departing Hong Kong, members of the national team will spend three days in Macau.

 England trailed Sri Lanka by 214 runs on day one of the first test after bad light stopped play on Wednesday at Old Trafford where the tourists' decision to bat first backfired when they were all out for 236.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and opted to bat under cloudy skies but his side were three down for six runs after seven overs before he led their recovery efforts with a confident knock of 74 in the middle order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were 22 for no loss in four overs with Ben Duckett and Dan Lawrence at the crease. Sri Lanka, who were unable to get their fast bowlers to use the new ball in fading light, opted to walk off with a few minutes left until stumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a good day. When you bowl on day one on a test surface like that, to be batting at the end of the day I think you're really happy," said England's Chris Woakes, who took 3-32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a hard pitch offering assistance for England's seam attack in the first innings, Sri Lanka's openers were stifled early on as the bowlers dominated the opening session to reduce the visitors to 80-5 at lunch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, captained by Ollie Pope with Ben Stokes ruled out with a hamstring injury, were left frustrated when De Silva stitched together a valuable 63-run partnership with test debutant Milan Rathnayake, who came in at number nine. (Reuters)

    Maresca: Chelsea 'not a mess' after more transfers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maresca at Chelsea's season opener against Man City at Stamford Bridge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767146_1_20240822082401.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca insisted Wednesday he was not presiding over a "mess" of a squad after the London club were involved in yet more transfer activity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  João Felix signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge, with his return from Atletico Madrid to the club where he spent an underwhelming spell on loan in the 2022-23 season helping facilitate Conor Gallagher's move in the opposite direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca now has one of the largest squads in the Premier League at his disposal, although he has made it clear Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are not part of his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking ahead of Chelsea's Conference League play-off against Servette, Maresca said criticism of the club's transfer policy had been unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not working with 42 players, I am working with 21 players in first-team training," the Italian said. "It's not a mess like it looks from outside. The other players can even have 20 years contract, it is not my point. I don't care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the position of Sterling and Chilwell, he added: "In this moment, they are training apart from the squad. As I said, the situation with both of them is quite clear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a big squad, for me it's impossible to give everyone minutes so if they're looking for minutes, probably it is better to leave. And in case they don't leave, they have a contract here, they are Chelsea players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he was understandably more upbeat about João Felix, with Maresca – whose side started the new Premier League season with a 2-0 defeat by champions Manchester City last weekend, saying: "He is a good player, a talent. The club already knows him from two years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He can play different positions with us, inside, as a nine, outside," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No transfer fee was revealed for the former Benfica star, who made two appearances for Portugal at Euro 2024. (AFP)

    US stocks climb on Target results, Fed minutes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street edged up on optimism over possible interest rate cuts. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767130_1_20240822045304.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Wednesday following solid earnings from big-box retailer Target and Federal Reserve meeting minutes that hinted at an upcoming interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Target – Walmart's smaller, North American-focused rival – soared more than 11 percent after reporting higher comparable store sales in its second quarter after a string of declines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, futures markets continued to bet on a September interest rate cut following Fed meeting minutes in which a "vast majority" of policy makers expressed support for an interest rate cut if economic data plays out as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones ended up 0.1 percent at 40,890.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,620, while Nasdaq rose 0.6 percent to 17,918.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed minutes were "dovish and though they're dated, they suggest the debate is not whether the central bank cuts interest rate at its upcoming September meeting but rather how aggressive the initial phase of this normalization cycle should be," said a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interest rate cuts are expected in light of a weaker US jobs market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Department figures released on Wednesday showed US employers added around 68,000 fewer jobs monthly in the 12-month period through March 2024 compared with earlier estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Ford climbed 1.5 percent despite announcing US$1.9 billion in costs connected to shifts in its electric vehicle strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automaker scuttled plans for one new EV model and pushed back the timeframe on a second vehicle in light of a slower-than-expected transition to EVs in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com, the Chinese online retail company, fell 4.2 percent after disclosing that Walmart divested its shares in the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among retailers reporting Wednesday, TJ Maxx parent TJX jumped 6.1 percent while Macy's slumped 13 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's economic and trade links with China are "yielding results" as he welcomed Premier Li Qiang to the Kremlin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two sides boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy economic sanctions from the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our trade relations are developing successfully... The attention that the two governments on both sides are paying to trade and economic ties is yielding results," Putin said in a meeting with Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our states have worked out large-scale joint plans, projects in economic and humanitarian spheres, we expect for many years ahead," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li told Putin that "Chinese-Russian relations are at an unprecedentedly high level," according to the Kremlin's translation of his remarks, saying Putin and President Xi Jinping had created a "strong impulse for further deepening of bilateral relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate meeting with Li, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin hailed the countries' links as a powerful stabilising factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our partnership and strategic cooperation is especially important in a situation where new contours of the global order are being formed," Mishustin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And in these conditions, the Russia-China link is a powerful stabilising factor, promoting economic growth in both countries and increasing quality of life for our citizens," the Russian premier said. (AFP)

    Ship catches fire after attack off Yemen: UK agency

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three projectiles hit a merchant vessel off Yemen's rebel-held port city of Hodeida on Wednesday, causing a fire onboard and leaving the ship without engine power, a British maritime security agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Athens identified the vessel as the Greek-flagged Sounion oil tanker, and Greece's Maritime Affairs Minister Christos Stylianides condemned "a serious threat" to international shipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tanker was "struck by two unidentified projectiles before being hit by a third," said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its crew earlier exchanged fire with two small vessels, one with three to five people onboard while the second carried around 10, said the agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a fire onboard and the vessel has lost engine power," UKMTO said, adding that "the vessel is drifting and not under command."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the UKMTO and the Greek port authority said there were no reports of casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson for the port authority said the Sounion, an oil products tanker owned by Greek shipping company Delta Tankers, carried a crew of 25 people, mostly Filipinos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had departed from Iraq and was destined for a port near Athens where many refineries are based, the Greek port authority said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the ship could have been hit either by missiles or drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attack came as the Iran-backed Houthi rebels keep up a nine-month-old campaign against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that they say is in support of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stylianides in a statement "condemned the attack, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and a serious threat to the security of international shipping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such acts put the lives of seafarers at risk and disrupt the free movement of goods along vital maritime routes," the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate incident south of the Yemeni port city of Aden on Wednesday, another ship reported three explosions in the water in close proximity, UKMTO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew are reported safe and vessel is proceeding to the next port of call, the agency added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis' campaign of rocket and drone attacks has severely disrupted maritime traffic through the Red Sea, which normally accounts for up to 12 percent of world trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea now have security teams on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and Britain have responded to the attacks by striking Houthi targets in Yemen since January, but it has done little to deter the rebels. (AFP)

    Israel kills Fatah leader accused of 'terror attacks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel killed a senior member of the Palestinian Fatah movement in Lebanon on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating attacks in the West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response, the slain militant's Fatah party accused Israel of seeking to "ignite a regional war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khalil Maqdah was killed in a strike on his car in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, according to Fatah and a Lebanese security source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said an air force "aircraft struck the terrorist Khalil Hussein Khalil Al-Maqdah in the area of Sidon in southern Lebanon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said Maqdah was the brother of Mounir Maqdah, who heads the Lebanese branch of Fatah's armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and accused them both of "directing terror attacks and smuggling weapons" to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged that the pair "collaborate on behalf of" Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack marks the first such reported attack on a senior member of Fatah, the movement led by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, in more than 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement following the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fatah said Maqdah had been killed "in a cowardly assassination carried out by ... Zionist (Israeli) warplanes on Sidon," describing him as "one of the leaders" of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Lebanon, the movement's armed wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said Maqdah had "a central role" in "supporting the Palestinian people and its resistance" during the Gaza war and an "important role in supporting resistance cells" for years in the West Bank. (AFP)

    Indian PM Modi begins landmark Poland, Ukraine visit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi launched on Wednesday his historic trip to Poland and Ukraine, where the premier has pledged to campaign for a peaceful resolution of Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to make a Ukraine trip and first in 45 years to travel to Poland, Kyiv's staunch ally that is a key transit for foreign leaders heading to its war-torn neighbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda on Thursday, as well as with Indian nationals living in the Central European country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This visit will add momentum to the India-Poland friendship and benefit the people of our nations," Modi said on X upon landing in Warsaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Modi commemorated an Indian maharaja who sheltered Polish children during World War II, before laying flowers at a war memorial and delivering a speech to the Indian community in Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland "needs a lasting partnership with India," deputy Polish Prime Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters before Modi's visit, adding that economic ties would also be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has trodden a delicate balance between maintaining India's historically warm ties with Russia while courting closer security partnerships with Western nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His government has avoided explicit condemnations of Russia's 2022 operation in Ukraine, instead urging both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region," Modi said in a statement published on Wednesday before his departure for Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Kyiv, Modi will hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and "share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "India has consistently advocated for diplomacy and dialogue to reach a negotiated settlement," Indian foreign ministry official Tanmaya Lal said before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky announced on Monday that "a number of documents are also expected to be signed" during the meeting with Modi, whose previous diplomatic efforts drew condemnation from Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, hours after Russia pummelled multiple cities across Ukraine, Modi visited Moscow and was pictured hugging Putin at his residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also visited Russia in 2019 and hosted Putin in New Delhi two years later, weeks before Moscow began its offensive against Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India has largely shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia and abstained on UN resolutions targeting the Kremlin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Russia's fight with Ukraine has also had a human cost for India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi has pushed Moscow to return several of its citizens who signed up for "support jobs" with the Russian military but were later sent to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least five Indian soldiers have been killed in the conflict. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani man appeared in court on Wednesday to face charges of cyber terrorism after allegedly spreading disinformation on his clickbait website thought to have fuelled anti-immigration riots in Britain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Farhan Asif was accused of publishing an article on his Channel3Now website falsely claiming that a Muslim asylum seeker was suspected in a deadly knife attack on children in the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK authorities have blamed online misinformation for sparking days of riots which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers as well as police officers and other properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a 31-year-old software engineer with no journalism credentials, apart from running the Channel3Now website, which served as a source of income for him," a senior official at Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Initial investigations indicate that his sole intent was to make money through clickbait content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asif appeared at a Lahore district court on Wednesday charged with cyber terrorism and was remanded to custody for one day, the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article with the false information was published on Channel3Now just hours after the attack and was widely cited in viral social media posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen English towns and cities saw unrest and riots after the July 29 knife attack that killed three girls during a dance class in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, a 2014 World Cup winner, announced his retirement from international football on Wednesday at the age of 38.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayern Munich veteran Neuer played 124 matches for Germany, captaining his country 61 times. His final appearance came in the quarter-final loss to eventual champions Spain at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer wrote on social media that although he was tempted to play until the 2026 World Cup, he was "convinced that now is the right time to take this step."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He shone at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and was named as the tournament's best goalkeeper as Germany won the trophy for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer revealed he had made the announcement after discussions with his family, as well as a comprehensive conversation with Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he planned to "concentrate fully" on playing for Bayern, with whom he has won two Champions Leagues and 11 Bundesliga titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season's Champions League final will take place at Munich's Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer broke his leg in a skiing accident in December 2022 and only returned to the Germany squad just ahead of Euro 2024 on home soil, reclaiming his role as first choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great time which shaped me and of which I am very proud," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winning the World Cup title in 2014 and the special atmosphere during the European Championship at home this year are highlights for which I am extremely grateful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was an honour for me to be captain of our national team until 2023. I loved wearing the Germany jersey."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer follows fellow 2014 World Cup winners Thomas Mueller and Toni Kroos, who both played at Euro 2024, into international retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, current Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan, who missed the 2014 World Cup campaign through injury, also announced he had played his last game at international level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A product of the Schalke academy in his home town of Gelsenkirchen, Neuer made his international debut in 2009 and has more caps than any other Germany goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany won 81 of the 124 matches Neuer played in, and he kept 51 clean sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The retirement clears the way for long-time back-up Marc Andre ter Stegen of Barcelona, who is expected to take over from the Bayern captain as Germany's number one. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Divers searching for six missing people following the sinking of a superyacht off Sicily in a storm have found two bodies, sources told media.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery brings the confirmed death toll to three. It was not immediately clear who had been found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The missing include British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and the chairman of Morgan Stanley International Jonathan Bloomer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen people survived, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven people, including the chairman and an executive director of a listed company, have been arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in connection with a fraud case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The investigation revealed that the chairman of the listed company and other individuals had allegedly falsified business documents and accounting records of the company's subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau, while the company's trade receivables totalling over MOP$113 million (about HK$110 million) were reduced,” the ICAC said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, the individuals concerned had also allegedly used false documents and accounting records to conceal the misappropriation of the company's funds over HK$9 million.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said it had teamed up with the Securities and Futures Commission to search six premises earlier this week and arrested the seven individuals involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees had allegedly committed the offence of agent using documents with intent to deceive his principal under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau police also searched the company's offices in Macau and interviewed individuals as part of their investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC added the investigation was ongoing and it would not make further comments on the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A delegation from Polytechnic University has won nine awards at the Silicon Valley International Inventions Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A cardiac monitoring device that's a tiny, light, wireless and wearable patch garnered two awards, including the semi-grand prize and a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Zheng Zijian, who led the research team behind the patch, said the device is as accurate as the machines used in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our permeable electronic skin, [electrocardiogram] electronic skin is the first of its kind that allows ICU-grade accuracy for long-term wearable… The permeability is superb, so that you can allow for long-term and accurate monitoring,” Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So for the next phase, we're working with the industries, venture capitalists, and trying to commercialise our technologies.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A nighttime brace designed to help teenagers with scoliosis earned a special prize issued by the Korea Invention Promotion Association, as well as a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Joanne Yip, who led the research team involved, said the brace could be commercialised next year and could sell for about HK$3,000 to HK$4,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our product, this nighttime brace, is the first one in the world using textile and soft robotics to provide early intervention for the patients with scoliosis. I can say this product is actually designed based on the patient's will, that we want to give them a more comfortable, but yet effective treatment,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are recruiting patients in Hong Kong for the clinical trial… We want to commercialise next year and because I think the cost is not too high, so it's affordable for patients and their families.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  University vice-president Professor Christopher Chao said this was the second time PolyU had joined the technology exhibition in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the main purpose was to help the research teams and startups understand the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They need to understand more about the market and also the investment ecosystem more, otherwise all these startup companies may not be able to be successful. In fact, this is sometimes even more important than the technology itself,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday announced that its first-half net profit for 2024 dropped three percent year-on-year to HK$6.13 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's bourse operator said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$4.36 per share, three percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, HKEX said net income for the second quarter, covering April to June, rose nine percent to HK$3.16 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were supported by the growth in trading and clearing fees from higher volumes across the cash, derivatives and commodities markets, according to HKEX's earnings statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKEX's Chief Executive Bonnie Chan said sentiment appears to be on the mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, while macro-environment uncertainties persist, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year," she added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six smart vending machines along the Wan Chai harbourfront are now in operation, selling grab-and-go snacks and beverages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following a soft launch on Wednesday, people can order ice cream, popcorn, candyfloss and drinks from the self-service, unattended machines between 7am and 11pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are hoping to provide such services round-the-clock in future, but did not offer a timetable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the soft launch period, we will monitor the visitor flow and see if there is anything that we can do better elsewhere along the harbour," said the Development Bureau's senior engineer, Phoebe Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brendan, 6, was among the first to try the machines and told RTHK: "I just got ice cream and popcorn... I think they need like 100 kinds of flavours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist surnamed Bleazard said the prices for food and beverages, which are between HK$18 and HK$35, were reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The vending machine is good because you don't have to talk to anyone. You just choose what you want and you pay and you go,” he said. "Otherwise, you have to wait for the person, and hope they're open."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kiosks are part of an initiative announced in this year's budget to introduce food and beverages, retail and entertainment services on a pilot basis at “suitable harbourfront locations”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is hoping to introduce similar facilities along the promenade in East Kowloon by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Sports Institute is reviewing a funding scheme for athletes, with an outcome expected early next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as debate continues as to whether the city's athletes earn enough to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has been working to provide a more supportive environment to our athletes, so they can better train, compete and enjoy a good career path after retirement," Lee said at a reception for SAR Olympians at government headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Authorities have been in close contact with the sports institute and sports associations to strengthen the subsidy schemes and training regimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on Facebook afterwards, Lee said Hong Kong is proud of every Olympian, "whether they won a medal or not".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foil fencer Ryan Choi reignited the debate on athlete funding on Tuesday when he posted details of an unnamed teammate's income and expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fencer received a monthly allowance of HK$7,130 while having to shoulder costs for competing overseas, including air fares, accommodation and registration fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only want to shed light on the situation faced by some of my teammates, and hope they'll receive better treatment," he said in another online post on Wednesday, before removing both posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the reception, the president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, Timothy Fok, said more events are in the pipeline to make sure the athletes remain in the limelight after the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday started an anti-subsidy investigation into certain dairy products imported from the European Union (EU), according to the Ministry of Commerce.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The probe will cover imported dairy products including fresh cheese and curd, blue cheese, and some milk and cream, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will look at a number of subsidies under the EU's common agricultural policy and should be concluded within a year, but could be extended for six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The application to launch the investigation came from the China Dairy Association and China Dairy Industry Association, the ministry added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe joins a number of other pending Chinese inquiries into EU trade practices, including an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trade ties between China and the EU have suffered after the EU earlier announced tariffs for Chinese-made electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the European Commission said it planned to impose five-year import duties of up to 36 percent on Chinese electric cars, unless Beijing can offer an alternative solution to a trade row over state subsidies. (Agencies)

    Housing Society to put rents up by 10 percent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced 10 percent rent increases for residents of the 20 public estates it operates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each household will see a rise of at least HK$230 per month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes come into effect in October, but tenants will be given a three-month waiver given the current economic situation of Hong Kong, the society said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The public housing body is envisaging a revenue loss of almost HK$24 million due to the waiver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The society stressed that in increasing rents, it has taken into account how much tenants can afford to pay, along with its financial needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it has incurred an operational loss over the past two years due to rising maintenance costs and it expects further losses in the next two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the new rent levels will remain unchanged until the next review in 2026.

    Walmart 'seeks to offload JD.com stake'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Walmart is the largest shareholder in JD.com, one of China's largest e-commerce companies. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767033_1_20240821134140.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Walmart is seeking to raise up to US$3.74 billion by selling its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters, as the US retailer focuses on its own operations in China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walmart is offering 144.5 million American depositary shares in the price range of US$24.85 to US$25.85, the term sheet shows, and Morgan Stanley is the broker-dealer of the offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walmart, the largest shareholder in JD.com, said in a statement that it had been a valued partner over the past eight years, and the US retailer was committed to a continued commercial relationship with the Chinese e-commerce giant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This decision allows us to focus on our strong China operations for Walmart China and Sam's Club, and deploy capital towards other priorities," Walmart said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com's Hong Kong-listed shares fell more than 10 percent in early trading on Wednesday. US-listed shares dropped 10 percent in after-market trading on Tuesday to US$25.50 after Bloomberg first reported the share sale plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese e-commerce giant last week reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, though its share price has fallen around 70 percent since its peak in early 2021, and trade is little changed from 2016 levels, when Walmart became its major shareholder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail market has been hit by a persistent downturn in consumer confidence, sparked by a property market slowdown and concerns about employment and incomes. Major e-commerce firms, including JD.com and rivals Alibaba and PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo have engaged in a price war in order to entice consumers to buy, pressuring revenue growth and margins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Walmart said the reduction was to focus on the Chinese market, especially Sam's Club," Liu Xingliang, an internet industry analyst at Beijing-based DCCI Data Center said of the share sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This means that Walmart is optimising its global business layout, rather than lacking confidence in JD.com's development prospects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walmart reported a 17.7 percent year-on-year rise in revenue from its China business to US$4.6 billion in the second quarter on the back of strong growth in its Sam's Club warehouse chain and its digital offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US retailer owns a 5.19 percent stake in JD.com, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The partnership between the companies began in 2016 when Walmart sold its Chinese online grocery store, Yihaodian in return for a 5 percent stake in JD.com. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who got to meet Hong Kong's Olympians in person on Wednesday said they learnt a valuable lesson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sharing session, which followed an open-top bus parade by the athletes, took place behind closed doors inside government headquarters in Tamar and lasted about half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlie, who trains in track and field, said she found out what it takes to become an elite athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a great opportunity for us student athletes to have a better understanding of how high, elite-level athletes, how they compete, what they prepare mentally, physically and also maybe psychologically on such a big stage, the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it's a great experience for us to know more about the profession, and also it allows us to be more motivated for our own respective sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the session, the athletes headed outdoors to meet fans who had been waiting at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey drew cheers everywhere she went, and she stopped to sign autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians then gathered on the lawn for a photo with some primary school pupils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes' packed schedule was set to continue in the afternoon with a lunch hosted by Chief Executive John Lee, followed by a joint reception by the SAR government and the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.

 The Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics on Wednesday received a hero's welcome around town, with excited fans braving the rain to applaud the athletes on board two open-top buses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 90-minute parade featured members of the team such as Paris gold medallist and fencing queen Vivian Kong and swimming star Siobhan Haughey, who took home two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's only two-time Olympic champion, fencer Edgar Cheung, did not attend the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two buses carrying the star-studded delegation set off from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin and passed by Tai Wai MTR station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier, considered the best viewing locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shirley, one of hundreds of onlookers, voiced her support for the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All athletes are worthy of our attention, because everyone has to put in time and effort. Not just the champions and runners-up, but all Hong Kong athletes. They all deserve our applause," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Su was part of the enthusiastic crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so excited. It was amazing. I yelled the loudest at the scene. I cheered for Vivian Kong, Siobhan Haughey, and Hong Kong. I told Vivian Kong not to cry, and to give us smiles," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dan, who's from California, said: "I think it's great. Hong Kong needs to support its athletes and its sports people more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a good way to meet the people of Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes received roaring applause as they arrived at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alice, 11, said she got an autograph from Haughey towards the end of the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that she is very perseverant. When she sets a goal, she won't give up. I also swim, so we are kind of the same person," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The athletes] did a great job and I want them to keep going and never give up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR team bagged two gold and two bronze medals at the Paris Games.

 Manchester City forward Phil Foden won the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foden played a key role in City winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old scored 19 times and delivered eight assists for Pep Guardiola's team as they pipped Arsenal to the title on the last day of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win this award is something very special and it is one that I am very proud of and grateful for. To be recognised this way by your fellow professionals means everything and I would like to thank everyone who voted for me," Foden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also want to pay special thanks to Pep, the City coaches and all my teammates as they help me to try and get better every single day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden has already set his sights on a fifth successive Premier League crown after City started their title defence with a 2-0 win at Chelsea on Sunday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Women's T20 World Cup scheduled for October has been moved out of Bangladesh and will instead take place in the United Arab Emirates, the International Cricket Council announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the venue comes after unrest that led to the overthrow of prime minister Sheikh Hasina after 15 years of iron-fisted rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 450 people were killed in the weeks of protests leading up to her August 5 ouster, most by police fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank the team at the BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) for exploring all avenues to try and enable the event to be hosted in Bangladesh," ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But travel advisories from the governments of a number of the participating teams meant that wasn't feasible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "However, they will retain hosting rights. We look forward to taking an ICC global event to Bangladesh in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tournament will be staged October 3-20 across two venues in the UAE – Dubai and Sharjah. (AFP)

    Blinken says 'time is of the essence' for Gaza truce

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken said in Qatar on Tuesday there was no time to waste in securing a Gaza ceasefire deal, as he wrapped up a Middle East tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Time is of the essence" for a truce deal between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, Blinken told reporters at Doha airport as he prepared to fly back to Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This needs to get done, and it needs to get done in the days ahead, and we will do everything possible to get it across the finish line," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said on Monday in Tel Aviv that Israel has accepted a proposal by the United States to bridge the gaps between the two sides and urged Hamas to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports however quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying his government would insist on keeping control of the Philadelphi corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken, asked about Netanyahu's remarks, said that since the start of the conflict it was made "very clear that the United States does not accept any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And recent talks have been "very clear on the schedule and location of IDF (army) withdrawals from Gaza, and Israel has agreed to that," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He declined explicitly to reject Netanyahu's reported remarks, although another US official earlier said the stance was "not constructive" to closing the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and withdrew troops and settlers in 2005, although it has since maintained a crippling blockade on the Palestinian territory and imposed a siege during the current war. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday after an earlier rally supported by strong retail sales figures and a cooler inflation report – as investors look towards a speech from the Federal Reserve chief later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.2 percent to 40,834, while the S&P 500 Index retreated by the same amount to 5,597.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.3 percent to 17,816.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a volatile couple of weeks, and we had a big, big rally from the lows," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, after that kind of a move – and it's been eight or nine days now of the S&P 500 being up – it's pretty typical to have a quiet day of consolidation like we're seeing today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stock markets climbed after the consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, logged its smallest 12-month increase since 2021 – boosting the prospect of a September interest rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But now, investors are looking ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the annual gathering of central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is widely anticipated to keep alive the prospect of a September start to rate cuts – and could give clues on the path of further reductions ahead.
  <br/>

  Among individual companies, shares in cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks jumped 7.2 percent on the back of quarterly results that topped estimates. (AFP)

    Scotland drug deaths rise, among worst in Europe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The cities of Glasgow and Dundee had the highest rates of death.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scotland recorded an increase in drug deaths last year, official figures showed on Tuesday, as the country continues to have one of the highest rates of such deaths in Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deaths by drug misuse have blighted some of Scotland's poorest communities for decades and are often branded its "national shame."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Records of Scotland (NRS) said drugs claimed the lives of 1,172 Scots in 2023 – up 121, or 12 percent, from 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland had recorded its lowest drug death figures in five years in 2022, sparking hopes that the country had turned a corner in its fight against drug misuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 279 fewer people died from drug misuse that year compared to 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer-term trend shows that drug misuse deaths are still much more common than they were over two decades ago," said Phillipa Haxton of the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opioid drugs – such as heroin and methadone – were implicated in 80 percent of all drug deaths last year, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures also highlighted a growing threat from super-strong synthetic opioids such as nitazenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They showed that the number of men who died from drug misuse rose by 113 in 2022 to 805 last year, with men twice as likely to die as women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cities of Glasgow and Dundee had the highest rates of death, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People in the most deprived areas of Scotland are more than 15 times as likely to die from drug misuse compared to people in the least deprived areas," said the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland regularly appears at the top of studies measuring drug deaths per million people in European countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the UK, the drug misuse mortality rate was 2.7 times higher in Scotland than in England and Northern Ireland using data from 2022. (AFP)

    US official says Netanyahu remarks 'not constructive'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US official on Tuesday criticised "maximalist" remarks attributed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on maintaining control of the Gaza-Egypt border, saying it was not helpful to reaching a ceasefire with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Maximalist statements like this are not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line," said the senior official travelling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the Middle East, requesting anonymity to talk about sensitive discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such remarks "certainly risk the ability of implementing-level, working-level and technical talks to be able to move forward (once) both parties agree to a bridging proposal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that Blinken stood by his public statement in Tel Aviv on Monday that Netanyahu had agreed to a US proposal to bridge the gaps on a ceasefire laid out on May 31 by President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, in reported remarks to families of victims of attacks, said that Israel would insist on maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor between Gaza and Egypt which Israeli forces seized from Hamas in the more than 10-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We saw the prime minister's comments, especially on some of these items. We're not going to negotiate in public," the US official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that such "technical" issues would need to be ironed out in further discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing Secretary Blinken and the United States are convinced of is the need for getting the ceasefire deal across the finish line," the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be additional conversations on technical specifics, many of which of course are being discussed in the press, which is certainly not helpful to the process," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States expects diplomacy to move forward this week between Israel and Hamas on reaching a ceasefire, despite uncertainties in particular on Hamas's response, the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We fully expect this process to continue into this week," the official said, without confirming any formal meeting this week involving Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House last week, when presenting the bridging proposal in Doha, said that it expected new talks on finalising the deal to take place later this week in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived in Doha late Tuesday for talks with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, after meeting the leaders of Egypt and Israel. (AFP)

    Putin likens Kursk incursion to Beslan school massacre

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Vladimir Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766960_1_20240821011916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday likened Ukraine's incursion into Russia to the 2004 Beslan school massacre, in which some 330 people died in a hostage siege.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin visited the school for the first time in almost 20 years, paying tribute to the victims at memorials, including a cemetery and the site of the destroyed school, where Chechen militants took more than 1,000 people hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meeting mothers who lost children in the siege, Putin said that Russia's enemies are again trying to destabilise the country, referring to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just as we fought the terrorists, today we have to fight those who are carrying out crimes in the Kursk region," Putin said, referring to Ukraine's cross-border offensive that began two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But just as we achieved our goals in the fight with terrorism, we will achieve these goals also in this direction in the fight with neo-Nazis," Putin added, sitting opposite three women from the Mothers of Beslan group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And we will undoubtedly punish the criminals, there can be no doubt of that," Putin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mothers of Beslan group has long called for an objective probe into the attack and the Russian authorities' response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The September 2004 siege lasted some 50 hours, ending in a gunfight when Russian special forces stormed the building following explosions in the school gym, where the hostages were being held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege in the Caucasus region of North Ossetia came amid a guerilla insurgency by Islamist Chechen separatists, branded "terrorists" by Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin launched a major Russian offensive to quash Chechnya's armed bid for independence in late 1999, weeks before becoming president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war against the Chechen insurgency helped fuel Putin's initial popularity, but at the end of 2019 he described the Beslan siege as a "personal pain" that would remain with him for life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin and the Kremlin were criticised for their handling of the attack at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the meeting with Putin, the Mothers of Beslan complained that Russia's investigation into the school siege has never been completed, the group's co-chairwoman Aneta Gadiyeva told the Agentstvo news outlet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This part of the meeting, unlike Putin's remarks about Ukraine, was not televised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gadiyeva said Putin told the women that he had not known this and would ask the head of the Investigative Committee to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that Russia's handling of the siege had "serious failings" in terms of preventing the attack and its use of excessive lethal force and called on Moscow to take measures to establish the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came two years after Chechen fighters took hundreds hostage in a Moscow theatre, a stand-off which saw more than 130 killed – most by sleeping gas pumped into the theatre by Russian special forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack," the Kremlin press service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also laid red roses at a monument to members of Russia's special forces who died during the storming of School Number One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An "international cultural and patriotic centre for the prevention of terrorism" has been set up at the site of the former school, the Kremlin's press service said on Telegram. (AFP)
