    Non-HK trained nurses to work here after law changes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says the legal changes are needed as Hong Kong faces an acute shortage of nurses. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761985_1_20240717171322.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong, with the government hoping it could help resolve an acute shortage of nurses in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials project that in 2030, Hong Kong will see a general nurse shortage of 8,700, with the number falling to 6,000 in 2040.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legal amendment introduces a new pathway allowing non-locally trained nurses to work in the SAR through special registration, without the need to pass local licensing exams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is subject to them having worked full-time for five years at specified institutions, and that their employers confirm they were satisfied with their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another pathway, there will also be limited registration or enrolment for the admission of non-locally trained nurses to serve in premises such as care homes, social welfare service units and nurse training schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current amendments to the Nurses Registration Ordinance do not seek to change the role of locally-trained healthcare professionals as the backbone of our healthcare system," health minister Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers before the passage of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Admitting non-locally trained nurses is an effective measure to address the local nurse shortage in the short term, so that Hong Kong's shortfall of healthcare professionals does not undermine the quality of healthcare and care home services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many lawmakers spoke in support of the bill, but they also expressed concern the new arrivals would need training and would need to overcome language barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said while bringing in non-locally trained nurses could ease the pressure of overburdened staff, he said he thinks it's not just a matter of "adding up the numbers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government needs to ensure service quality and that there would be sufficient supervision, especially at care homes.

    Exco conditionally approves arts hub funding plan
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kevin Yeung (right) says the funding plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least 10 years. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761981_1_20240717170517.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council has conditionally agreed to a funding proposal to allow the cash-strapped West Kowloon arts hub to sell some of its land parcels to ease a financial shortfall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority will be allowed to sell residential developments within Zone 2 of the site and keep all proceeds received from tenders to private developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means the development of residential blocks in the zone will no longer be restricted by the “Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) only" model adopted since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Culture minister Kevin Yeung on Wednesday said the plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, with very great effort of the authority, the BOT tender did not seem to meet with the appetites of the contractors or developers in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Instead of having a constant stream of income in the many years in future, we are now cashing in for a lump sum upfront, which could help release the financial challenges or the requirement at present."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority will have to meet certain requirements, including a triennial cap on operating deficits and a cap on the percentage of staff costs in relation to the total annual operating expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body's chairman, Henry Tang, said they can now avoid "drastic" cost-cutting measures such as reducing the number of days each week that the M+ museum is open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added that the authority will come up with ways to boost income without adding to the strain on the public coffers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to operate as we have always done under a discipline that we only spend what we need to spend and we will control our costs diligently and very seriously," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are ways that I can make more revenue without disrupting the operations of the museums and I will look for ways to do that."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Bangladesh urged all universities to close on Wednesday, the day after at least six people died in violent protests over the allocation of government jobs and police raided the headquarters of the main opposition party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dhaka University, at the centre of the violence, decided to suspend classes and close its dormitories indefinitely, a university official told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University Grants Commission asked all public and private universities to close until further notice, in order to protect students, but the request did not have legal force and it was not immediately clear how many universities would comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said at least six people were killed on Tuesday in violence across the country as student protesters clashed with pro-government student activists and with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence was reported around the capital, Dhaka, the southeastern city of Chattogram and the northern city of Rangpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Dhaka police raided the headquarters of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, accusing it of playing a role in the violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Asian nation has been rocked by protests for weeks over public sector job quotas, which include a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence from Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has sparked anger among students who face high youth unemployment rates, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people. (Agencies)

    Take advantage of 'panda economy': DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB urged the government to make good use of the two incoming pandas as a means to promote the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as the party submitted its Policy Address recommendations to Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, DAB lawmaker Holden Chow said the “panda economy” could benefit the tourism, catering, and cultural sectors in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We very much look forward to these pandas coming to Hong Kong, and that would definitely boost our tourism," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the chief executive [in his Policy Address] would very much focus on the economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the New People's Party (NPP) said the government should set up a joint-immigration checkpoint at Hong Kong International Airport, to strengthen the SAR's status as an aviation hub by improving connectivity with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after submitting the NPP's Policy Address recommendations, the party’s chairwoman Regina Ip said co-location checkpoints are popular as they make travel to the mainland easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Co-location is nothing new. We already have co-location at the Shenzhen Bay control point and there will be more co-location facilities in the Greater Bay Area, and it's very popular with the visitors and with the travellers. So I don't think it will raise any legal problems. Of course, suitable legal amendments will need to be made,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the government should look at ways to attract locals and mainlanders to stay in Hong Kong over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council, Tien said many Hongkongers are travelling north because the cost of living in the city is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whatever you buy in Hong Kong is more expensive than you can get for the same thing in Shenzhen. That's why a lot of Hong Kong people no longer spend their weekends in Hong Kong. So how do we tackle that? We suggest that we need to go high-end, to move up the market," he said.

    Govt asks CLP to speed up lightning rod installation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tse Chin-wan said he hopes CLP can install 500 lightning rods at power supply facilities in two years." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761957_1_20240717150415.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he has urged power company CLP to speed up the installation of more lightning rods, as part of efforts to avoid power outages caused by extreme weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response to a question in the legislature, the minister said the company reported 26 "significant" outages in the past three years, 10 of which were caused by external factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said he met CLP's senior management on Tuesday to discuss recent blackouts and stopping bad weather affecting the power supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He cited the power company as saying it plans to install another 100 rods in two years at facilities such as transmission towers, but said he asked them to do 500 instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The plans are not taken forward fast enough. They're expecting in two years' time they can install 100 more such [devices], but I think this is a bit too slow," Tse told lawmakers at a council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker William Wong asked officials to lay more underground cables, so there would be less external disruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said in response that this has been the practice in new towns, but CLP still has lots of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that the power company has told him that in the event of outages, it would deploy more manpower to help residents, as well as using mobile power supply vehicles.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Book Fair opened on Wednesday, attracting scores of visitors and book lovers to the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Abby Johnson, who teaches at TWGHs Tsoi Wing Sing Primary School, said she was hoping to buy authentic literature books for her students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secretly, I'm hoping to find some books for myself too as well later on," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student Jaccari said the fair offers better prices than book stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Book Fair usually secures a better deal, compared to maybe walking around in book stores, especially the chained ones which are more expensive," Jaccari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raistlin Lau, under secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, emphasised the importance of the fair in an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The publishing and printing industry is one of Hong Kong's important creative industries, and the Book Fair is an essential part of promoting industrial development," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as single-entry tickets which cost HK$30 for adults and HK$10 for children, visitors to the fair can also buy a super pass for HK$88 to enjoy unlimited entry to the week-long event, which ends on Tuesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Wednesday said Hong Kong should make good use of its common law jurisdiction, particularly when it comes to taking advantage of the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam participated in the 16th antechamber meeting, which focused on the Belt and Road Initiative. This monthly informal gathering brings together government officials and lawmakers from the Legislative Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Lam said Hong Kong needs to leverage its strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The central people's government takes the view that Hong Kong in future should focus on firstly enhancing Hong Kong's role as a platform for providing professional services, including, for example, to serve as an international legal service centre,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And secondly, to promote financial services and to enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre in particular in the area of green finance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same occasion, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said authorities were actively working towards strengthening cooperation with Belt and Road countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the Belt and Road Office is organising all these activities in coordination with the central government for organising visits to the Belt and Road countries, checking the enterprises and the professional services, going abroad and meeting different sectors so as to promote Hong Kong and our advantages,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted the government was also working towards joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a wide-ranging free trade agreement.

 HSBC on Wednesday named chief financial officer Georges Elhedery as the bank's next chief executive to drive "the next phase of development and growth".

  "The Board concluded that Georges was the outstanding candidate and we look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery will take over on September 2 from current CEO Noel Quinn, who announced his retirement in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and previously held the role of Co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets before being appointed chief financial officer in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanon-born, French-educated banker also led the bank's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkey region from July 2016 to February 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before assuming the role of CFO in 2023, Elhedery had a six-month sabbatical that included spending time learning Mandarin, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery has a "track record of leading through change, driving growth, delivering simplification, containing costs and brings a strong focus on execution," Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery said he was "deeply honoured" by HSBC's trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory," he said in the filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC said it would announce the next chief financial officer in due course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn would work with Elhedery to ensure a "smooth and orderly" handover before stepping down, the bank added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn, 62, oversaw a transformation of the London-headquartered lender and saw record profits during almost five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under him, the bank accelerated a years-long pivot to Asia -- where it generates most of its revenue -- vowing to develop its wealth business and target fast-growing markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank concluded the sales of its Canadian operations and its retail bank operations in France. It will also sell its Argentina division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn last year led the effort to repel a bid by major shareholder Ping An to spin off its Asia assets, with the proposal eventually voted down by shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The break-up bid highlighted HSBC's precarious position amid US-China tensions, with some observers questioning whether Europe's largest lender can continue to straddle East and West. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi on Wednesday said the new citizenship and social development (C&S) subject that replaced liberal studies in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education exams didn't make it any easier for students to achieve better scores overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some 94 percent of all candidates passed the new subject, which has either a pass or fail result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the C&S subject, I think we have a standard criteria and reference for assessment. So the result doesn't mean it's easier than before and it is not comparable because it is a newly adapted curriculum,” she told reporters after giving a speech to students at a school in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So I think we appreciate very much the effort from teachers and also from the students that they achieved their good scores.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she is pleased to see that students’ performance across all core and elective subjects improved overall, compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 17,600, or 43 percent of daytime secondary school pupils got the grades needed for a publicly-funded university place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Ariel Lau, from Jockey Club Ti-I College, said she wants to study English at either Chinese University or City University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was out of my expectations to pass all my core subjects. I had so much anxiety. I couldn't sleep last night and it was very troubling for me. I'm very conflicted right now on what to choose because before I thought I might have to take the associate degree. But now that I've got 5** in English, I think I might have the upper hand in choosing between the two programmes,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students with physical disabilities also accomplished great results. One pupil with cerebral palsy at Hong Kong Red Cross Princess Alexandra School got a 5** in business, accounting and financial studies. He said his biggest obstacle to studying was not being able to move around easily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I can't sit for a long period of time, or else my legs will feel tense. My writing speed is also a bit slower than a normal person. I need to stretch and relax my muscles frequently during my studies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, 10 students from eight schools achieved top marks across six subjects, up from four last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from La Salle College. One said he is going to Imperial College London to study economics, finance and data science, while another said he plans to stay in Hong Kong and study at Chinese University's medical school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe it's because a family member of mine became sick when I was young. I think a doctor doesn't just provide good treatment for patients but also provides mental support. Now that I have this chance, I would also like to provide mental support for my future patients," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from St. Paul's Co-educational College. One plans to study medicine in the SAR and the other economics in the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It means a lot to me because I grew up in a grassroot family. I know the struggles, I know what it feels like to struggle about your daily necessities… and by studying economics, I learn about government policies, social welfare and I can utilise my knowledge to say, not necessarily assisting the government, but maybe reflecting the needs of minorities to the government,” the second student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong Chinese Women's Club College produced a top scorer for the first time ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very excited! Looking at the past records, more top scorers came from elite schools. I never expected myself to be one of them. I am really thankful to every teacher in the school. I hope I can encourage other students to fight hard for their dreams," the student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other top students came from St. Joseph's College, King's College, Ying Wa Girls' School, Diocesan Boys' School and Pui Ching Middle School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, around 49,000 students received their DSE results on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boston's Jarren Duran, the All-Star MVP, hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning as the American League beat the National League 5-3 on Tuesday night for its 10th win in the past 11 All-Star Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes pitched a hitless first for the NL, twice hitting 100mph, and Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer in the third for a 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Juan Soto hit a two-run double and scored on David Fry's single to tie the score in the third, and Duran went deep off Cincinnati's Hunter Greene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duran is the fifth Boston player to be an All-Star MVP, the first since J.D. Drew in 2008. The others were Pedro Martinez in 1999, Roger Clemens in 1986 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. (AP)

    Thai police suspect poison killed 6 people in hotel

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand on Wednesday were investigating the deaths of six people in a luxury hotel in downtown Bangkok, with police saying their demise may have been caused by poisoning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lt. Gen. Trairong Piwpan, chief of the Thai police force's forensic division, said there were traces of cyanide in the cups and thermoses that police found in the room, but initial results of an autopsy were expected on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangkok police chief Lt. Gen. Thiti Sangsawang identified the dead as two Vietnamese Americans and four Vietnamese nationals, and said there were three males and three females.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A husband and wife among the dead had invested money with two of the other victims, suggesting that money could be a motive, according to officials, citing information obtained from relatives of the victims. The investment was meant to build a hospital in Japan and the group might have been meeting to settle the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victims had booked several rooms at the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel under seven names, and some were staying on a different floor from the room where they were found dead, according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were still looking for the seventh person included in the booking, Thiti said at a news conference at the hotel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there were no signs of a struggle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The residents of the room where the bodies were found were supposed to have checked out earlier Tuesday and their luggage had already been packed, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were discovered by a maid who went to the room after they failed to check out and found it locked from the inside, Thiti added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was food that had been ordered earlier from room service that was left uneaten, but drinks had been consumed, Thiti also said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He would not confirm a cause of death, but said the deaths appeared to have occurred about 24 hours before police arrived on the scene Tuesday evening after being called by hotel staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin went to the hotel later on Tuesday evening, and afterwards told journalists the incident was neither a robbery nor a random assault, and that it should not affect Thailand’s tourism industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pending the results of autopsies, “Our hypothesis is that they ingested something that killed them,” Srettha said. (AP)

    Elon Musk to move Space X HQ to Texas

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Musk says he will move the company's HQ from California due to the state's stance on gender issues. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761901_1_20240717093702.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk on Tuesday said he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas after a California law blocked schools from forcing teachers to notify parents about changes to a student's gender identity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is the final straw," Musk said on X a day after California governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill that fired up the already fraught culture wars in a tumultuous US election year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas," Musk said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The multi-billionaire also said that he is transferring X, formerly Twitter, from its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco to Austin, a threat he has made before but never saw to completion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building," Musk wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has already moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, but still maintains an "engineering headquarters" in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tycoon has expressed deep disdain for the use of preferred pronouns, often mocking the practice on social media and dismissing it as part of a "woke" agenda that was dangerous for society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk is the father of a trans daughter from whom he is estranged, and he blames her California private school education for making her politically far left and turning her against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom on Monday enacted the law after a contentious legislative process that pitted a handful of school boards fighting for parental rights against LGBTQ activists concerned about the welfare of vulnerable students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law reversed decisions in conservative school districts that ordered teachers to notify parents if a student changed their name or pronouns, or requested to use facilities or participate in programs that didn't match their official gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom, who is seen as a potential alternative to President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate for the White House, has often exchanged fire with conservatives over gender issues at state schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, he signed a law that sets fines for school districts that ban textbooks portraying LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom also fought bitterly with a conservative school board over its opposition to the study of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a San Francisco public official who was assassinated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has previously sparred with Newsom, who is a former San Francisco mayor, during the deadliest stages of the Covid-19 pandemic when he challenged the decisions of city and state health officials. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="It's the second straight record for the blue chip index. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761896_1_20240717091245.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to another record on Tuesday on bullish reaction to positive earnings reports amid optimism over the rising likelihood of US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blue-chip index piled on 1.9 percent or more than 740 points to finish at 40,954.48, posting a second straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,667.20, also a record, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent to 18,509.34.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The records were driven partly by outsized gains for Bank of America and Dow member UnitedHealth Group following earnings reports, as well as an ongoing rotation of funds towards smaller companies that have underperformed in 2024 but are expected to be boosted by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides UnitedHealth, the Dow's biggest gainers included industrial giants Boeing and Caterpillar. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least five demonstrators were killed in Bangladesh on Tuesday during violent clashes between rival student groups over quotas for coveted government jobs, police said, a day after more than 400 others were injured.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as university students battled with counter-protesters backing the ruling Awami League party, fighting with sticks and hurling rocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence marks an escalation in efforts to hinder a determined weekslong campaign of sit-in protests and street marches that has ignored calls by Bangladesh's prime minister and top court for students to return to class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three people were killed in the port city of Chittagong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All three had bullet injuries," Chittagong Medical College Hospital director Mohammad Taslim Uddin said, adding that "some 35 people were injured".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rival student groups marched in several key locations around the capital Dhaka, some throwing bricks at each other, with traffic in the city of 20 million almost ground to a halt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the day wore on and with some key highways blocked by the protesters, the authorities deployed the paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) force in five major cities including Dhaka and Chittagong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had been tasked with controlling "the law and order situation in view of the quota protests", a BGB spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have demanded an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of heroes from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nadal celebrates after his victory against Sweden's Leo Borg. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761891_1_20240717084121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal swept past Leo Borg, son of tennis great Bjorn Borg, to advance to the second round of the Bastad Open on Tuesday as he builds towards the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was Nadal's first singles match since the 38-year-old fell in the opening round at Roland Garros on May 27, and he eased to a 6-3, 6-4 win in wet conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Nadal and the 21-year-old Borg, currently ranked 461st in the world, were wild card entries to the Swedish clay-court tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an early scare with the former world number one slipping on the wet white line, Nadal broke for 3-1, hitting four aces to take the first set in 43 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An immediate break gave the Spaniard a foothold in the second, sealing the match on his second match point after 1hr 25min on court for his eighth ATP tour match win this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's good, I'm finally defending my title," joked Nadal, who has not played in Bastad since winning the title aged 19 in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't been playing a lot of tennis in the last few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even in the tougher moments, I have been able to keep going with the help of the team, but of course the fans have a huge impact on that. They give me amazing energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam winner praised his rival, the son of the long-retired former world number one Bjorn Borg, now 68.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a huge honour to play against the son of one of the biggest legends in the history of our sport," said Nadal. "I think he played quite well, he has a great future in front. I wish him all the very best." (AFP)

    Real Madrid officially unveil Kylian Mbappé

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé finally put on a Real Madrid jersey on Tuesday, fulfilling his childhood dream in front of a packed Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 80,000 fans were in hand at the Bernabeu to welcome the 25-year-old France star during his official presentation as the club's newest player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After signing his five-year contract with the Spanish powerhouse alongside club president Florentino Pérez, Mbappé entered the stage set up at the Bernabeu to loud cheers by the Madrid fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wearing the No. 9 jersey, Mbappé smiled broadly and waved to the fans who chanted his name, then embraced Pérez and former Madrid player and coach Zinedine Zidane, who invited Mbappé to visit the Spanish club for the first time when he was just a teenager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's an incredible day for me," Mbappé told the crowd, in good Spanish. ”Since being a kid I dreamed about playing for Madrid and today I'm here. It means a lot to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé finished his speech by asking the crowd to join him and chant “Hala Madrid,” similar to what his childhood idol – and “now friend” – Cristiano Ronaldo did when he arrived at the club. Mbappé then kissed the club’s shield and went around the Bernabeu kicking balls to the crowd in the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now I have another dream, which is to live up to the history of this club, the best club in the world,” he said. “I’ll give my life to this club and to this shield.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record 15 European Cups won by Madrid were on display on the stage where Mbappé was introduced. His relatives, club officials and several former players were also by the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I see my family happy, I see my mother crying,” said Mbappé, who earlier Tuesday underwent his physical with Madrid's doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The message “Welcome, Mbappé” was shown on the large video boards at the newly revamped Bernabeu, which had its roof closed for the midday ceremony in the Spanish capital. (AP)

    China voices support for Palestinian factions meeting

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed willingness to facilitate "reconciliation" between rival Palestinian factions, after Fatah said its officials would meet in Beijing with Hamas counterparts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas later said it would be attending talks in the Chinese capital at what it called an "expanded factional meeting" this weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement responded with a positive spirit and national responsibility," official Hossam Badran said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas was "keen on achieving national unity worthy of our Palestinian people... especially in light of the Al-Aqsa Flood battle," he added, using the militant group's name for its October 7 attack on Israel that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Beijing had "always supported all sides in Palestine to achieve reconciliation and unity through dialogue and negotiation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, he said, was "willing to develop dialogue and reconciliation, provide a platform and create opportunities for all sides on the Palestine issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to strengthen communication with all parties and work hard to realise the aim of Palestine's domestic reconciliation," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two Palestinian groups have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas' resounding victory in a 2006 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several reconciliation bids have failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank, where Fatah is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal leaves following the weekly cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761868_1_20240717041226.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's government, which will now serve only in a caretaker capacity, the presidency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French politics have been in gridlock since an inconclusive snap election earlier this month, with parties in the National Assembly scrambling to put together a governing coalition and no successor to Attal in sight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Tuesday, Attal said he would propose meetings with competing political groups "to move towards an action pact" on forming a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he ruled out any prospect of staying on himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do not aspire to be the next prime minister. I will not be the next prime minister," the outgoing premier told the broadcaster TFI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attal and his team would "handle day-to-day business until a new government is named", the Elysee Palace said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this period to come to an end as quickly as possible, it is up to republican forces to work together to build unity," it added, referring to mainstream political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron had announced the plan earlier in the day at the government's first cabinet meeting since his allies were roundly beaten earlier this month in a snap parliamentary election he had called to "clarify" the political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron told the ministers he would ask Attal to stay on "for some weeks", probably until after the Paris Olympics, which open on July 26, meeting participants said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This gives political parties more time to build a governing coalition after the July 7 election runoff left the lower house without an overall majority grouping. (AFP)

    US retail sales flat in June as consumption cools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the US Department of Commerce. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761856_1_20240716215636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States slipped less than analysts anticipated in June on a weaker performance in the auto and gas segments, government data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slower consumption growth adds to recent data showing that the world's biggest economy is cooling gradually – a trend likely to raise the central bank's confidence that it can soon begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To ease demand and bring inflation back down sustainably, the Federal Reserve has rapidly lifted the benchmark lending rate and in recent months, held it at a decades-high level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the Department of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, May's increase was revised slightly higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, the rise in June was 2.3 percent, a cooldown from the prior month as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long been expecting consumers to pull back as higher interest rates bite, lifting borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that consumption growth will, if anything, slow further in [the second half this year], as high interest rates continue to weigh on demand and the labour market takes a further turn for the worse," said Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among sectors, sales at auto dealers dropped 2.3 percent from May, while those at gas stations dropped three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But excluding auto and gas, total retail sales was up 0.8 percent in June – indicating that there may still be some way to go yet in easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales at restaurants and bars was up 0.3 percent from a month prior, the Commerce Department report showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is set to make its next rate decision at the end of July, and analysts widely expect the central bank to begin lowering rates in September. (AFP)

    IMF maintains 2024 global growth forecast

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The IMF held its global growth expectations for 2024 steady in a report on Tuesday even as it cut forecasts for the United States and Japan, while warning of inflation risks and trade tensions ahead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, unchanged from its April forecast, according to its World Economic Outlook update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia, particularly in the technology sector," said the fund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For 2025, it expects global growth of 3.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even as many countries saw better growth than anticipated in the first three months this year, the IMF flagged what it called notable surprises in Japan and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington-based lender also cautioned that upside risks to inflation have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated for longer, "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An area of concern is trade and industrial policy, with countries potentially adopting measures that impact the global economy's integration, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if risk assessments have shifted after the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's nominee in November's election, Gourinchas noted the fund will consider its implications. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong passport holders can now stay in Thailand visa-free for a maximum of 60 days, up from 30, the Immigration Department announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A department spokesperson said in a statement that the two places have a close relationship in people-to-people and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the Belt and Road Initiative, this extension of the period of visa-free entry will bring greater travel convenience to holders of HKSAR passports and strengthen the tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, 172 countries and territories have granted visa-free access, or provide visa-on-arrival services, to Hong Kong passport holders.

 After eight years, four major tournaments and two finals, Gareth Southgate announced he was stepping down as England manager on Tuesday, saying it was “time for change.”
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunday’s 2-1 loss to Spain in the European Championship final proved to be his last game in charge of the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As a proud Englishman, it has been the honor of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,” he said. “But it’s time for change, and for a new chapter.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate’s contract was due to expire this year and his announcement comes after months of uncertainty surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Oyarzabal’s 86th-minute winner in Berlin was a painful way to end his reign after he transformed the fortunes of England’s underperforming national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hired in 2016, he led England to back-to-back finals at the Euros and to the semifinals of the World Cup in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, ultimately, he was unable to end the nation’s decades-long wait for a first major trophy since the World Cup in 1966. (AP)

    Fish-allergic children may eat some fish: CUHK study

<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Chinese University on Tuesday said they have developed a ladder system to help children with fish allergies reintroduce the food into their diet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The researchers said that between 2016 and 2021, they studied 249 children with fish allergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were found to be allergic to the protein β-parvalbumin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said some types of dark fish, such as salmon and tuna, have lower levels of the protein in them compared to fresh fish, such as tilapia and catfish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Agnes Leung, said she hopes the ladder system can help children with allergies eat some kinds of fish, because the food has nutrients that can't be found elsewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fish has very unique nutritional properties, for example, Omega 3 fatty acids are unique to fish, they help a growing child's brain development," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said they found that around 30 percent of the children in the study were not allergic to shellfish, such as shrimp and crab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major allergen in fish is parvalbumin, but the major allergen in shellfish is tropomyosin, so they are fundamentally different," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For a lot of fish-allergic patients, they could in fact tolerate shellfish without developing allergic reactions."

 Thirty Hong Kong secondary school students will attend a young astronaut training camp on the mainland later this month, to get a taste of the country's space programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their nine-day trip includes stops in Beijing, as well as space facilities in Jiuquan, Gansu province, and Wenchang in Hainan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Space Museum said it's the first time the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre will open to a Hong Kong delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students will get to put on spacesuits, make and fly rocket models and may get to meet real-life astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the students were picked from a pool of 200 applicants, who were nominated by their schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Form two student Law Shun-yan is among those heading to the mainland and said he's very interested in the country's space development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud of China's space development. I want to become a space scientist or even an astronaut," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope to share what I experience in Jiuquan and Wenchang with others in Hong Kong, so that they get to know more about space, so we can study in this field together in future and contribute to our motherland's aerospace industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony before the students headed off, Chief Secretary Eric Chan described the students as new blood for the SAR's integration into the country's development plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an international innovation and technological centre, Hong Kong surely has its responsibility to contribute what we can to the country's space missions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan thanked mainland authorities and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the camp, for their support.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) says companies in the SAR should look for investment opportunities in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edmund Lo, an economist at HKTDC, on Tuesday said investors should look out for green investments in Vietnam as this aligns with national policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another economist at the council, Henry Cheung, said Laos is looking for infrastructure investments to develop logistics, while Cambodia has several focuses ranging from digital infrastructure to being a logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irina Fan, director of research at HKTDC, said investors should look at both demand and national policies when determining business trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most important thing is to look for trade activities because when the trade activity moves up to a certain level, it will trigger investment activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) would also like to diversify from what they are doing, so this is a time where they would need investment support, they would need solution support."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nongfu Spring lashed out at the Consumer Council on Tuesday, accusing the watchdog of affecting its reputation by making what is said were biased comments towards its water content.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company demanded an apology and clarification from the watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council was following up on a lawyer's letter issued by Nongfu Spring, a day after the watchdog revealed its test results on 30 bottled water brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring said the watchdog wrongly categorised its product, applied an incorrect testing standard, and claimed the findings were misleading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed the council's findings caused panic among Hong Kong and mainland consumers, and had caused "massive" damage to its brand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring stressed it would take further action unless the watchdog apologised and clarified its test results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council confirmed it had received a letter issued by Nongfu Spring's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It maintained its analysis showed all samples of bottled water it tested were safe to drink.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten students have achieved perfect scores in this year's university entrance exams, up from four last year, while an overwhelming majority of Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam candidates passed the new citizenship and social development subject.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority on Tuesday said eight male and two female pupils got a perfect 5** across six subjects and earned "attained" in the new citizenship subject that replaced liberal studies, with eight of them also acing an extended mathematics module.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top scorers are among more than 49,000 DSE exam candidates who will receive their results on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,600 daytime secondary school pupils, or roughly 43 percent, met the minimum requirement needed for a publicly-funded university place, known as "332A22".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means scoring at least level 3 in both Chinese and English, level 2 in maths, and “attained” in the citizenship and social development subject, as well as level 2 in two electives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said 94.1 percent of candidates sitting the new subject achieved an "attained" level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wei Xiangdong, the authority's secretary general, said the introduction of the subject, graded with “attained” or “unattained”, was not a factor when it came to the increase in top-performing students this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it makes it easier to gain so many 5**, because all the other subjects, their assessment criteria did not change, and we used standard referencing every year. It should be equally difficult or easy to get 5** in other subjects," Wei said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricardo Mak, the director of public examinations, stressed that a number of overseas institutions recognise the new subject, including world-renowned universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Cambridge University, Simon Fraser University in Canada and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore also require students to have the ‘attained’ level in this subject to be admitted to their academic programmes,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams authority also said it’s highly concerned that question-and-answer booklet content had been uploaded to social media platform Xiaohongshu, a move which resulted in a woman’s arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said the incident did not affect the confidentiality of the exam questions, as such content was posted online after the tests had taken place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams body added there are no plans right now to significantly expand the number of testing sites across the border after holding the exams at two centres in the Greater Bay Area this year.

    Almost six percent of Hongkongers have iron deficiency

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six percent of Hongkongers suffer from iron deficiency, according to a Department of Health study.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the department said it arrived at the figure after research involving 2,000 people aged between 15 and 84.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that iron deficiency, which can cause tiredness among other things, is more prevalent among girls and women, with 17.5 percent of those between 15 and 49 suffering from the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[With] regular menstruation there is blood loss, with blood loss there is iron loss, therefore women of reproductive age have higher iron requirements and are more prone to iron deficiency,” said Dr Rita Ho, head of the department's non-communicable disease branch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said 10.6 percent of females aged 15 to 49 have the more serious problem of iron deficiency anaemia, which can cause further health issues including fatigue and shortness of breath. Only 0.3 percent of males have the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures are similar to those in other high income places, such as Canada and the United States, the department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said people can increase their iron intake by eating fish, eggs and beans, as well as up to 500 grammes of red meat per week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the department advised against iron supplements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is enough iron absorption [from meals] and the iron supplement is not necessary. There is too much iron in the supplements, there may be gastrointestinal side symptoms such as constipation,” Ho said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people were killed and multiple others were wounded in a shooting near a Shiite mosque in Oman's capital Muscat, police said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooting was a rare event in the otherwise stable sultanate, which has a Muslim-majority population, including a small minority of Shiites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said Pakistanis were among the wounded, but the numbers had yet to be confirmed, according to Islamabad's embassy in Oman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's ambassador to Oman, Imran Ali, visited some of the wounded in the hospital, the embassy posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert following the shooting and cancelled all visa appointments Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "US citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities," the embassy wrote on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While several mosque attacks have roiled the Arab Gulf region in recent years, the incident on Tuesday is unprecedented for Oman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 2015 suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kuwait killed at least 27 worshippers and wounded more than 200 others. It was claimed by the Islamic State group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That same year, Saudi Arabia saw two attacks on Shiite mosques in the span of one week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB called for better road maintenance in Central and Western District to address concerns regarding uneven roads, cracked pavements, and loose and sunken paving bricks which affects the safety of pedestrians and vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The DAB recently inspected roads in the district and identified more than 200 spots with poor pedestrian or traffic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said repairs in the past were fixed with poor quality paving material because it was quick and convenient. However, many repairs were damaged over time due to tree root growth, vehicles driving, and heavy trucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have continuously reported to the Highways Department to do emergency repairs, however, the material they are using is not durable...it may only last a few days after they do repair work," said District Councillor Rex Ip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legislative Councillor Chan Hok-fung called for a re-evaluation of the quality of asphalt used for emergency repairs and the strengthening of inspections so that work could happen as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said while bigger repairs may come with disruptions, they were necessary to ensure the durability and longevity of new roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It may take over a month to do the whole repair work [for Caine Road]. If we could show the public that after the complete maintenance work is done, it may last for a few years, even though it may cause a bit of inconvenience.”

 Henan province on Tuesday issued an orange alert for rainstorm, the second-highest level in the country's four-tier weather warning system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From Monday to Tuesday morning, heavy downpours lashed many parts of the province, with a maximum precipitation of 638.5mm recorded in Sheqi County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The province's meteorological observatory has forecast heavy rain to fall in some areas till 9am on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's northern regions are bracing for extreme weather conditions. According to a meeting held on Monday by authorities including the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management, the main rain belt is expected to move northwards in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will bring heavy rainfall to the Sichuan Basin and the Huanghuai region, encompassing parts of several provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management has ordered relevant provincial-level regions to focus on vulnerable areas, including flood-prone rivers and urban drainage systems. (Xinhua)

    HK swimming body to share review findings on rules

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's swimming governing body will announce the findings of a review of its rules within this year after a recent controversy on competition qualifications, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong China Swimming Association came under fire after initially barring a nine-year-old swimmer from competing due to his club's low ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The young swimmer is now allowed to join the championships in an individual capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said sports associations should take a pragmatic approach in reviewing their rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On resource allocation and organisation of competitions, each association is required to draw up their own rules. We also believe that this is the right approach," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if problems are identified, then a pragmatic approach should be taken in resolving these issues. Discussions are necessary to consider all options on enhancing the mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that the swimming body, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China and other representatives will have a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he will lead a delegation to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia later this month to explore business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The delegation will include professionals from the trade, legal, commerce, logistics and innovation sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Asean is Hong Kong's second largest trade partner and a huge emerging market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We attach importance to our cooperation with these countries... I will talk to the business sectors and the political circles about what Hong Kong can bring to them, opportunities in various areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to get their support for Hong Kong to join RCEP [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership] so that Hong Kong can be a super connector and super value adder."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee announced the start of a public consultation exercise for his next policy address, adding that his team will attend more than 40 sessions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the sessions will focus on improving the economy and people's livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an open economy. We are affected by external uncertainties, say for example geopolitical tension, high interest rates, as well as challenges from different fronts. So we need to maximise our possibilities and opportunities," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Thomas Müller has called time on his 14-year international career after their European Championship exit, the Bayern Munich forward said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old featured in his eighth and last tournament on July 5, in Germany's 2-1 quarter-final defeat by Spain, where he was brought on as a substitute in the 80th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Müller helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and has the third most appearances for the national team with 131 caps and 45 goals. He also won the Golden Boot and Young Player Award during the 2010 World Cup, when Germany finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It always made me very proud to play for my country. We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together," Müller said in a farewell video on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I had the privilege of making my first international appearance, I would never have dreamed of all this. I would like to say thank you to all the fans and my Germany teammates for their support over the years. Take the enthusiasm and joy of this year's Euros with you." (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761747_1_20240716082151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chaotic scenes at the Copa America final have raised serious questions for the organisers of the 2026 World Cup which will be held in North America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The start of Sunday's final between Colombia and Argentina at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium was delayed by 82 minutes as overwhelmed security struggled to process the safe entry fans into the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers blamed ticketless fans for rushing the entry points into the venue for their decision to keep the gates closed for almost three hours after the planned opening time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, while there was plenty of evidence of ticketless fans entering, it was also clear that the security system was unable to cope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some fans needed medical attention for heat exhaustion after being stuck in the crush around the fencing at the entrance to the 65,000 capacity venue amid alarming scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard Rock Stadium will host seven games at the 2026 World Cup which the USA is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Copa America was organised by South American confederation CONMEBOL while the World Cup will be controlled by global governing body FIFA and it's local organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a good look," said former USA international Alexi Lalas, now a leading television pundit for Fox Sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand this is not a good look for CONMEBOL and this is also, because it is happening on our watch, in our country, not a good look for the US less than two years out from the World Cup," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA, who had no role in the running of the Copa, did not immediately comment on the incidents but sources indicated they would now intensify discussions with stadiums over their security plans. (AFP)

    Trump picks Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as running mate

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump won formal nomination on Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of last weekend's failed assassination attempt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump announced 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential pick, rewarding a one-time harsh critic who became one of his most reliable - and uncompromising - supporters in Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 78, is guaranteed a hero's welcome at the convention in Milwaukee, where delegates delivered their formal nomination two days after the scandal-plagued former president survived an assassination attempt at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," Trump posted on Truth Social.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vance had been widely expected as Trump's pick. He will bolster the ticket on the right wing, but with less chance of expanding appeal to more moderate voters and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standard-bearer for a new kind of populism that has come to the fore under Trump, Vance is also one of the least experienced VP picks in modern history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he embraces the ex-president's isolationist, anti-immigration America First movement. Vance is further to the right than his new boss on many issues including abortion, where he embraces calls for federal legislation. (AFP)

 Thousands of people in Madrid welcomed Spain's squad home on Monday after they beat England to win Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After receptions with King Felipe VI and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, La Roja were paraded through the capital city on an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was adorned with the message "it's only the beginning" and the trophy sat at the front of the bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want a lot," Sanchez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Sunday's match-winner in Berlin, Mikel Oyarzabal, wore white t-shirts with the number four on them in reference to the record number of times Spain have won the European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For now, we're not realising yet what we have accomplished," Williams said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacker, who scored the opening goal of the 2-1 victory, was also eager to thank Spain's fans "for the love and warmth they brought the team".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team bus took them to Plaza Cibeles in central Madrid where thousands more fans waited to celebrate the success, following on from victories in 1964, 2008 and 2012. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a car bombing at a cafe in Somalia's capital Mogadishu that was packed with football fans watching the the Euro 2024 final has risen to nine, security sources said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Witnesses described scenes of panic and chaos after the powerful blast late on Sunday, with people scrambling for safety and the main entrance to the cafe destroyed by the blaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Yusuf, an official from the national security agency, said nine civilians were killed and 20 others wounded in the explosion, raising the official toll of five given by police late on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The popular Top Coffee restaurant, which is located near the presidential palace in the centre of the city, was thronged with young men watching the final that Spain won 2-1 against England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were many people inside the restaurant, most of them youth who were watching the football match... but thanks to God, most of them made their way out safely after using ladders to climb up and jump over the backside perimeter wall," Yusuf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the state-run Somali National News Agency said Sunday it was carried out by Al-Qaeda linked Al-Shabaab jihadists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted online showed a huge fireball and plumes of smoke billowing into the night sky as the explosion ripped through the cafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was inside the restaurant watching the football match when I heard a huge explosion, there was smoke, dust and fire at the front side of the restaurant and we panicked," Said Muktar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I and several other people rushed towards the main entrance, but it was completely inaccessible," he said, adding that the "whole situation was chaos".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images of the aftermath of the bombing on Monday showed piles of rubble where the restaurant once stood and several burnt-out vehicles, as local residents inspected the scene. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the criminal case against the former US president on charges of mishandling top secret documents, saying the way that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed was improper.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision is a huge victory for Trump, who had been accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Aileen Cannon made her ruling after lawyers for the 78-year-old argued for a partial stay of proceedings to allow for an assessment of a Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former President Trump's Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on the Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith is GRANTED," Aileen wrote in her order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Superseding Indictment is DISMISSED because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Trump is set to be annointed as his party's champion at the Republican National Convention, days after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Florida case, Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 34-year-old man, allegedly linked to the suspected murder of a Chinese woman in Thailand, was arrested in Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yan Ruimin, a 38-year-old influencer, went missing during her solo trip to Thailand and is suspected to have been dismembered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect allegedly fled to Macau after the woman's death and tried to pawn a fake watch at a shop last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the shop staff were suspicious and reported him to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers eventually caught him at the Taipa Ferry Terminal and handed him over to mainland police on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the investigation, Macau police were informed by mainland authorities that the suspect could be hiding in Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After checking his identity, it was confirmed that he was the suspect in the murder case.

    'Consider inflation when setting public housing rents'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Winnie Ho says the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761682_1_20240715175648.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday called on the government to take into account inflation and the cost of living when reviewing public housing rents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The calls came after the Housing Authority proposed raising rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Edward Lau said the government should consider how much rent tenants can afford, as the city's economic recovery after the pandemic has been sluggish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Yang Wing-kit said the exemption period suggests a need to revamp the way rent increases are decided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Out of the past eight inspections, including this one, there have been four times when the Housing Authority provided some form of exemption or deferment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the entire mechanism is working well, you wouldn't need to specifically provide exemptions or delay payments. At this point, I think we need to consider whether the mechanisms in the current regulations require a review or optimisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is one thing needed to be very cautious about inflationary factors. Because when we incorporate them, we should consider the actual affordability of each tenant. Inflation goes hand in hand with deflation," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, in a deflationary period, the reduction in wages may be less than the decrease in prices. This could result in a situation where you have to reduce wages and increase rent. These are sensitive situations, and we should not make changes to our mechanisms casually."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent.

    Girl whose heart stopped had no underlying illness: HA

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Girl whose heart stopped had no underlying illness: HA" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761670_2_20240715171809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday said that a girl who suffered a cardiac arrest while getting stitches at a hospital didn’t have any underlying illnesses, after tests on her were negative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Sum-yuet, who’s now five, went to Yan Chai Hospital in late May to treat a head wound, but while getting stitches, her heart stopped beating for nearly 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She remains in critical condition in intensive care at Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her father had accused medical staff of pushing her head down on a pillow during the procedure, something that was denied by the HA, which said her head was tilted sideways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After meeting with the girl’s family, the HA’s chief executive, Tony Ko, again apologised over the matter, saying the gesture was needed since the “unfortunate incident” took place at a public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he wouldn’t say whether human error was involved, citing an ongoing criminal investigation by the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko stressed he wouldn’t go into details over exactly what went wrong, but an expert review of child care guidelines recommended checking patient vitals and consider using sedatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, when doing such procedures, [the expert panel recommended] how to better communicate with the patients and the relatives, how to closely monitor the patients, as well as in suitable cases when we need to introduce procedural sedation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[The panel is] not investigating the case, so mainly the purpose is to review our present guidelines to see which are the areas that we need to further emphasise and remind our colleagues to pay particular attention.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA chief admitted the guidelines wouldn’t clearly list out all scenarios, such as whether sedation was needed in each case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials discussed with frontline staff on ways to raise the overall safety of child patients, and the recommendations would be passed on to staff again later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said two medical staff involved in the girl’s treatment were transferred to non-clinical positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials would do their best to provide medical care to the girl as well as give necessary support to her family.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Terminal Expo will be held in Hong Kong this November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The expo will feature conferences, awards and forums centred on celebrating and introducing aviation technology advancements, as well as facilitating discussions about urban air mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Duck, executive vice president of Informa Market, said multiple sectors, from banking to restaurants, stand to benefit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong has been chosen for the expo because it is right at the centre as the biggest growth area for aviation in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This (expo) is very important to show to everyone within the region that the place to meet the most amount of people in the shortest amount of time, is here in Hong Kong," Duck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vivian Cheung, acting chief executive of the Airport Authority, said Chek Lap Kok has already made good use of new technology, from the third runway and facial recognition for passengers, to automated vehicles to carry luggage.

    'Housing estates to be more accessible for elderly'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Monday spoke at the Accessible for All @ Hong Kong Symposium about making residential areas more accessible for the elderly and disabled people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About a third of Hong Kong's population will be 65 or above in around 20 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elderly citizens living in older estates may not have as many aids, such as handlebars, that help them move around easily. Ho spoke about plans to install handles and assistance bars in commonly frequented areas at housing estates such as bathrooms, by the elevators, and in hallways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In our residential estate design, accessibility is of the utmost importance...it is very important for us to make it convenient for [the elderly] to be mobile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho mentioned other ideas to make areas around residences more accessible, citing hopes to build more bridges and lifts to accommodate those who live in hilly parts of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linda Lam, chairperson of the Equal Opportunities Commission, stressed the importance of creating a universally accessible society, especially as Hong Kong's population ages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accessible, barrier-free environments and facilities are the prerequisites for people with disabilities to participate equally in society," said Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As our population ages, the demand for such facilities becomes increasingly urgent."

    Beware of suspicious pop-up alerts: police

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beware of suspicious pop-up alerts: police" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761644_1_20240715141143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday warned people to watch out for suspicious pop-up alerts on their computers, to avoid falling prey to "technical support" scams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said 12 cases were recorded in the past two months, with total losses amounting to more than HK$17 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said scammers send false system alerts to computers and pretend to be law enforcement agencies, before asking victims to call technical support and transfer money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Superintendent Baron Chan from the force's cyber security and technology crime bureau said victims are usually foreigners and English speakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Nowadays, the operation systems that we are using in most of our computers are Western-based. The language we use is mostly English, so that's why the scammers purport the scam alerts, they are mostly using English,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 70-year-old retiree, who gave her name as May, said she lost around HK$10 million to fraudsters who posed as police officers and technical personnel at Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The alert seemed urgent and official and being accompanied by ongoing loud noise and flashing colours on the screen. It was a relief to be offered a solution to a computer security threat, so I called the number,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan advised people to install antivirus software and avoid calling any technical hotlines, adding that the force is taking steps to block such pop-up advertisements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If your computer displays some alert message, especially in full screen, you can try to press and hold the escape key on your keyboard or press control, alternate, delete at the same time to open the task manager to close the message, or even restart your computer to try to close the problematic pop-up windows,” he said.

 The Consumer Council on Monday advised people to opt for boiled tap water instead of bottled water.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During hot summer days, people tend to lose water more easily, and staying hydrated becomes crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consumer watchdog tested 30 bottled water brands, including mineral water and distilled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings revealed that tap water contained a higher mineral content than mineralised purified water and distilled water with added minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also discovered that the price of tap water was around 2,700 times lower than that of bottled water, as a litre of tap water costs around $0.00262 while distilled and purified drinking water costs HK$7.02 per litre on average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said tap water is a more eco-friendly and affordable option for consumers, compared to bottled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously our tap water, after you boiled it, it is much more economical, much more friendly, especially from an environmental protection point of view. Every bottle when you produce, you know, you're polluting the environment. Every bottle that you consumed, you are creating harm to the current environment as well as the next generation,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that all bottled water it tested passed its safety tests.

    Indoor playhouses urged to ensure facilities are safe

Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761629_1_20240715115159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The consumer watchdog on Monday called on indoor playhouse operators to ensure the design and layout of their facilities are safe, and to clearly list out terms and conditions to avoid disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council said it had received a complaint about a child suffering a forearm dislocation and a wrist fracture from a fall while navigating a rope tunnel at a playhouse, and that a request for a refund and compensation was initially met with "ambiguous responses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The venue involved only proposed compensation of HK$3,000 after the watchdog stepped in, but the child's parent had yet to accept the offer and was considering legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The council would like to remind the industry that indoor playhouses must follow stringent safety standards in terms of game design and venue layout. They should also properly assess and mitigate any safety risks and provide sufficient safety measures to participants to ensure a positive experience for both parents and children," the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complaints included a toddler playgroup centre providing unclear terms and conditions to use complimentary playtime offered alongside a course enrolment, and another members-only indoor playhouse resetting a customer's account balance to zero without prior notice upon the expiry of the one-year membership period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terms and conditions of use should be clearly stated, and flexible pricing policies are recommended to manage expectations and minimise disputes between traders and users," the watchdog said.

    China's economy slows in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by five percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to two percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent for the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS attributed the weaker second-quarter GDP growth to short-term factors such as extreme weather and floods, but said it also reflected rising challenges, especially from insufficient effective demand and unsmooth economic flow at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, the national economy has continued to improve in the first half in a stable manner," the NBS said in a statement, citing support from policy incentives, rebound in external demand and development of new quality productive forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Yeung, a chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that weak retail sales dragged down GDP growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's also very consistent with our on-the-ground observations in different cities in China. Of course you don't notice that when Hong Kong people go to Shenzhen. But in other cities, which is clearly more domestic, the consumption level is clearly weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, President and party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a work report on behalf of the Politburo at the start of the third plenum and expounded on a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the third plenary session has to focus on stabilising employment, noting reports of layoffs and salary cuts in the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately, what we need is to have a stable labour market and stable employment so that households will be more confident in spending. And that wage dynamic is the most important area the policymakers really need to focus on in the future," he said. (RTHK/Agencies)

    Police meet with retail trade to address theft

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they recently met with some 40 retail industry representatives to work on ways to prevent theft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the force recorded around 37,000 cases of theft between January and May this year, which represented a three percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them, there were 3,678 cases of shoplifting, a 12 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities arrested 1,750 people in total, of which around 150 of them were caught on suspicion of making repeated attempts at shoplifting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was suspected to have shoplifted five times during the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most common age group to commit shoplifting were those between 41 and 50 years of age, followed by those aged between 51 and 60 years. Police said there was no distinction between gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mong Kok, Tsuen Wan and Tseung Kwan O were the areas that recorded the largest numbers of shoplifting cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Common shoplifted items included pharmaceutical products, shampoo and razors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine and chocolate were the main targets from November to January each year, while fruit and ice cream were most popular during summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largest case involved two bottles of wine priced at around HK$130,000. The force said there was no fixed price range of stolen products, as shoplifters mainly act out of a sudden urge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They don't steal the items for the values of them. They don't need the items, they don't need the money," police clinical psychologist Michael Fung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In one study, more than 48 percent of them committed shoplifting because of their personal loss, psychological loss in recent times. It could be losing their spouse, their loved ones, their job, or mobility or health. That somehow triggered their depression or negative feelings, negative mood, [and] they need to find a way to cope with that.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police have offered security suggestions for the retail sector, such as allocating more staff to assist customers, arranging for security guards in plain-clothes to patrol shop floors, and upgrading surveillance cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police noted that shoplifters look the same as ordinary customers, but there are a few ways to identify potential thieves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, [shoplifters] wear extraordinarily big clothing during very hot seasons, as it is easy for them to put stolen property into their clothes and just walk out, or bringing extraordinarily big bags that are empty at first... these might be hints they want to do something,” chief inspector Kelly Choi, who works on crime prevention, said.

    HKUMed adopts generative AI literacy into curriculum

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Professor Joshua Ho (left) and student Minnie Chan (right) demonstrate an app that helps classify X-rays.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The HKU faculty of medicine will offer a generative AI literary series as a course to facilitate and enhance teaching and learning, through various multimedia methods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department has developed a simulation education system called KASES to imitate real-life patient scenarios and an app that helps classify X-rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of their disciplines or year of study, students can use these virtual systems with information compiled and validated by professors to practice the process of clinical reasoning and history taking. This particularly benefits first-year medical students who are not yet able to attend clinicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical Associate Professor and Director of Educational Technology Dr Gary Lau explained the need for AI literacy in the medical field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our future healthcare professionals must understand not only the potentials of generative AI but also the ethical issues, potential legal aspects, and professional considerations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While AI offers new opportunities for learning, Lau stressed the importance of not becoming over dependent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Teaching can not be purely replaced by AI. It will enhance our teaching, but the interaction of our students with real life patients is highly invaluable and cannot be replaced."
