<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis stars Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting will play for a mixed doubles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, after losing to North Korea's pair 3-4 in the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an up and down match, with Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong, the lowest seed in this tournament, starting with a bang and taking the first game 3-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong then took the second game 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth-seeded Hong Kong pair then had a 2-1 edge after winning the third game 11-3. But they dropped the next two, 9-11, 9-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall at the South Paris Arena, Doo and Wong went on to win the sixth game 11-9 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's when the North Koreans went on the attack, as they jumped out to a 7-0 lead behind Ri's strong forehand smashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair fought their way back to make it 6-9, before eventually dropping the final game 6-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean giant killers had started the tournament defeating the world number two pair, Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan, in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo will face South Korea's Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon, who lost to China's top-seeded Sun Yingsha and Wang Chuqin in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, Wong said they gave it their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Facing these North Koreans, they're the so-called dark horses. But any team in the final four has to be very good. So actually, when we faced them, we felt we were the dark horses," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So on the table, we fought until the very end, but we failed. We will collect ourselves for the bronze medal match and hopefully we can win a medal for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal match will take place on Tuesday at 7:30pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British TV news presenter Huw Edwards, a household name in Britain, has been charged with three counts of making indecent pictures of children, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edwards, 62, was the BBC's highest paid news presenter and anchored the broadcaster's "BBC News at Ten" bulletin for more than two decades. He resigned in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with three counts of making an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child relating to images found on a child's phone, according to court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat," a London police spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Edwards was arrested on 8 November, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was bailed to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards was one of the main faces at the BBC until his departure, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation, and leading coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He quit on medical advice after allegations emerged that he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing council of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) on Monday expressed disappointment over what it described as  “misjudgments" by management in bypassing the council when it changed the university's emblem two years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After a council meeting to discuss the logo change, chairman John Chai said the whole project cost around HK$4 million, most of which was spent on hiring international branding consultants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the emblem to mark the university’s 60th anniversary in October 2022 drew criticism from students and alumni who were not consulted. The new logo was later shelved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The university council will learn from experience and take appropriate measures to improve university governance and try to avoid a repeat of a similar incident,” Chai told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chai added that the university president Rocky Tuan – who announced in January that he was resigning – should take full responsibility for the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Tuan was unable to attend Monday's council meeting due to a work trip. Tuan will leave his post in January next year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung overcame a partisan home crowd to edge out Enzo Lefort of France for a place in the semi-finals of the men’s individual foil on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lefort took control in the opening stages, with Cheung ending the first round down 3-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete was able to turn it around early in the second round, but the French fencer fought back, leading to a nail-biting back and forth that ended with the second round score at 13-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, knowing he would go out if he lost another point, scored two quick points in an intense final round to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, taking Hong Kong, China into the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When you fence against a guy who is a two-time world champion, who is playing in his hometown with all the public, of course it’s going to be hard, harder than usual but Ka-long found the psychological resources to put the last point, which is amazing regarding to the match, so I am very, very again proud of what he did,” said coach Gregory Koenig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to understand that even when you are tired, you have enough adrenaline to find the resources. You are tired but the psychological is the most important at this point. Even when you have pain everywhere, you have to think ‘OK I have pain, but this is life, this is how it is, I have to do what I know what to do’ and that is what he did in the last two points. The last two points were amazing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Koenig added that his next opponent Kazuki Iimura of Japan would definitely be a challenge, saying the Japanese fencer might be shorter than Cheung, but he moves very quickly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The American restaurant chain Outback Steakhouse announced it will shut down nine of its 19 outlets in Hong Kong. About 300 staff are expected to lose their jobs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outback said the affected eateries are located in Causeway Bay, Central, Mong Kok and other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will stay open until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the chain described it as a difficult business decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We remain committed to Hong Kong market with our 10 branches and will continue to serve customers with the same commitment to quality and excellence that they have come to expect from the Outback brand," the chain added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority said Outback has not made MPF contributions to about 40 employees in May and June, totalling around HK$60,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said it urged the chain to settle outstanding MPF payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority added that it has not received any complaints from Outback staff.

    Djokovic downs Nadal in Olympic blockbuster

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic and Nadal of Spain embrace after their match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763742_1_20240729223953.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic crushed Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in their blockbuster Olympics clash on Monday as the two titans met for the 60th and possibly final time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The showdown between the two most successful men's tennis players in history appeared to be fizzling out before a late fightback from Nadal enabled him to avoid his heaviest-ever defeat by Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very relieved," said Djokovic. "Everything was going my way, I was 6-1, 4-0 up but I played a sloppy service game and gave him chances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic's 31st win in a rivalry that began on the same Roland Garros clay courts in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb added: "I never thought back in 2006 that we'd still be playing each other almost 20 years later."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal admitted Djokovic was the "clear favourite" ahead of their first clash in more than two years, with the Spaniard a shadow of the player who reigned for the best part of two decades at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 14 of Nadal's 22 Grand Slams have come in Paris, the 38-year-old has been plagued by injuries in recent years and he has slumped to 161st in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His participation in the singles in Paris had been in doubt until the last minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic has not had a good season by his stratospherically high standards but the 37-year-old Serbian rose to the occasion in his pursuit of an elusive Olympic gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed raced into a 5-0 lead before Nadal finally got on the board but Djokovic closed out the set and surged 4-0 ahead in the second before Nadal offered some belated resistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal clawed his way back to 4-4 only for Djokovic to break once more, this time making no mistake as he put away his old foe and perhaps brought down the curtain on one of the greatest rivalries in the history of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a bronze medallist on his Olympic debut in 2008, goes on to face Matteo Arnaldi or Dominik Koepfer for a spot in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will turn his focus to the doubles where he is in a dream-team pairing with compatriot Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the reigning men's French Open and Wimbledon champion, takes on Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor later Monday in the singles. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Laos signed 12 MOUs to boost cooperation during Chief Executive John Lee's visit to the Asean member state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in a media briefing in the capital Vientiane on Monday evening as he wrapped his visit to Laos, he said there's room for the two sides to further enhance ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our two-day visit in Laos is fruitful. We have a total of 12 MOUs being exchanged, from trade and economic partnership, investment promotion, Customs collaboration, education exchange, logistics cooperation, to financial services and air services development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, I believe Hong Kong and Laos will have huge potentials and opportunities for cooperation, and there's ample room to grow in terms of trade and people-to-people exchange."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is an ideal platform for Laotian companies to tap into the Greater Bay Area market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that more cooperation between both the business sector between the two places and people-to-people exchange will help produce good benefits to the two peoples," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also thanked Laos for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the visit, he met with the leaders of Laos and visited places such as Vientiane Secondary School where students have been learning Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech at the school, he said Polytechnic University has signed an MOU with the school, offering scholarships to high-achieving students so that they can study at the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also pointed out Hong Kong recently relaxed the visa policy for Laotian talent to work or study in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee will head to Cambodia on Tuesday on the next leg of his three-nation visit which also includes Vietnam.

 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung advanced to the quarter-finals on Monday, after beating Mo Ziwei of China 15-10 in the last-16 of the men’s individual foil at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is ranked third in the world, started out strong earning himself an early three points to put him ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo was able to fight back, but Cheung maintained good defence to put him at an 8-6 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo then bounced back into the action, but he couldn’t overtake the SAR star, who won in two rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will play host France’s Enzo Lefort in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said Cheung has to be prepared to face Lefort and a strong home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He has really the perfect mindset. He is self-confident, he knows he can be strong and this is what I want from him. Now as you can see on the table, he will have to fence Enzo Lefort, which is really the ‘chouchou’ of the French public, so it’s going to be hard,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be like in Rio against the Brazilian guy. He has to face off. If you want to become an Olympic champion, you have to face these kind of matches where you have to fence against one guy plus five thousand people of the public, but he will be prepared for this.”

 Hongkongers on Monday flocked to shopping malls and government facilities to watch Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and other SAR athletes in action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people were at a shopping mall in Kwun Tong to watch the live-stream of the Games on a giant screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the spectators was Valerie, who was there with her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really exciting, because there are people cheering when the athletes won or scored a point. I think this is really different (from) watching at home," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another spectator, Ena, said she was there to cheer on all the Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, their performance has been really motivational to all the Hong Kong citizens. Just wonderful to see more Hong Kong people step into the Olympics, like be the Olympians, and participate in such a big event," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, who was watching Cheung's bouts, said he was moved by the perseverance of the home-grown athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they are so hardworking. They put a lot of efforts on it. We should really support them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and star swimmer Siobhan Haughey are among those in action on day three of the Paris Games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Sheng Lihao claimed the Paris Olympic title in the men's 10m air rifle event on Monday, adding to his victory in the 10m air rifle mixed team event along with Huang Yuting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sheng, the silver medalist from Tokyo, set an Olympic record with a score of 252.2 points at the Chateauroux Shooting Center.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm quite satisfied with my performance at the Paris Olympics. As you could see, I encountered some difficulties during the competitions, but I managed to hold myself together and complete them," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lindgren of Sweden claimed silver with 251.4 points. He came from behind to eliminate Miran Maricic of Croatia by 0.5 points through the second shot of the penultimate series, scoring 10.6 to Maricic's 9.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite finishing first in Sunday's qualification round, the 19-year-old Sheng was not at his best, scoring 631.7 points, which is 6.2 points lower than his own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he responded with a strong start in the final and dominated after three series in the elimination stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two perfect 10.9 shots gave him a 2-point advantage over second-placed Arjun Babuta of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Sheng's lead diminished to 0.6 points before the final series against Lindgren due to two sub-10 shots, he managed a 10.5 and a 10.6 to secure victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the third shooting gold for China at Paris 2024 from five events, and the country's fifth gold overall. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Edgar Cheung on Monday easily booked his spot in the last 16 of men’s foil individual event at the Grand Palais in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer beat Daniel Gu of Canada 15-5 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung went ahead by seven points before his Canadian opponent started striking back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he could not narrow the deficit and Cheung went on to win in the opening three-minute period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This was the plan. We knew this opponent is a strong opponent but I knew if Cheung Ka-long is at his level, he can defeat easily and this was the plan,” said Cheung's coach Gregory Koenig after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will take on China's Mo Zewei next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I really wanted Ka-long to keep focus, to stay focus on every point even if the score was very high difference, to keep focusing, to keep fighting to be fully prepared for the next match, which is going to be to very tough against Mo Ziwei,” Koenig added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gu said he treasured the opportunity to take on an Olympic champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is no point being mad or upset about it. I already knew going into this, I am not a favourite to win, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like to get beat by someone that good,” said Gu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was fun. It is always a learning experience so all the hits and points he gets on me, there is a reason why he is an Olympic champion.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two SAR table tennis players, Wong Chun-ting and Zhu Chengzhu, on Monday won their singles matches at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw, Wong beat Ibrahima Diaw of Senegal in a nail-biter in a round of 64 match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair split the first six games, including a marathon second game lasting 14 minutes in favour of Wong, 18-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong prevailed in the seventh and deciding game, 11-4, to make it through to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, I feel satisfied with my performance today," he said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it was tough, but there were also some surprises... My opponent was in form quickly and acted more decisively, creating a lot of big difficulties for me. So it’s a good thing that I quickly adjusted my game, and luckily I won the second game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Zhu's victory in her round of 64 match was a more straight-forward affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept Chien Tung-chuan of Chinese Taipei 11-7, 11-7, 11-7, 12-10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Cindy Cheung was on Monday eliminated in the first round of women’s 100m backstroke in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She finished fifth in her heat at the Paris La Defense Arena in 1 min 3.45 secs, which put her 29th among 36 contestants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fastest 16 swimmers qualify for the semifinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff and Regan Smith from the United States and Australian Kaylee McKeown are in the top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though the time isn't the most satisfactory, I will still say it's a great opportunity, and I'm just grateful that I get to finally say that I've competed in the Olympics," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of performance, and may be like handling the nerves, I think there's still much to improve on, that I can learn from other more experienced swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yeah, I'm just here as a learning experience and to enjoy my time here."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A chief surgeon who performed two knee operations on Hong Kong fencing champion Vivian Kong says her Olympic success demonstrates her resilience and determination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Patrick Yung, who chairs the department of orthopaedics and traumatology at Chinese University, said he was moved to see Kong claim a gold medal in Paris at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's moving and touching. Indeed, I witnessed Vivian over the past seven to eight years overcoming all those big and small injuries," he told RTHK in an interview in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After all these years, [going] through all the injuries, all the different setbacks, she champions in the biggest stages in the sports world.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong’s journey to Olympic gold has been filled with ups and downs, after she suffered serious anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung recalled seeing in the newspaper Kong’s return to action just three months after her surgery in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She didn't tell me, so I called her up and said ‘How come you get back so soon?’ and then she just said 'hehe' and 'Well, I'm okay,' but since then I understand that this girl is very disciplined. She recovers very fast.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung, a long-time honorary medical doctor for the Hong Kong Sports Institute, said Kong’s recovery was exceptionally fast thanks to her unwavering discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have operated on thousands of ACLs, but she's probably the one who got the fastest recovery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, Kong withdrew from the Asian Fencing Championships because of another knee injury. But she recovered in less than a month to defeat Auriane Mallo-Breton in dramatic fashion in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In about a month's time, most people would be okay to walk around with that injury. But if we are talking about competing in the highest level of the sports arena, it's very much demanding. Again she performs another magic,” Yung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago. The top épéeist is the third Hong Kong gold medallist in history, following windsurfer Lee Lai-shan and fellow fencer Edgar Cheung.

 The Customs and Excise Department on Monday said its computer forensic lab is looking into the use of artificial intelligence to enhance efficiency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Senior Inspector Wong Wai-kei said the lab handles over 100 cases every year, noting a rise in complexity and case volume owing to big data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that customs are working to boost the accuracy of its technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The accuracy of our system is around 80 percent. This 80 percent figure is based on our previous training data. This accuracy can be influenced by various factors, such as data volume or complexity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, our technical personnel are currently fine-tuning this system. We hope to improve our data model and increase accuracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the technology would help with the analysis of digital evidence, such as text, images, and videos.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Industry representatives on Monday expressed mixed feelings about business sentiment during the Olympics, despite seeing a boost in foot traffic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK that he expects bar takings to surge as much as 10 percent during the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people might feel in the mood to spend after fencer Vivian Kong won a gold medal, but their elation wouldn't last long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If they're happier, then they will be in a better mood to either buy retail or if they're in a bar with friends watching the Olympics, normally it's conducive to spending some money. I'd say if anything, it'll be maybe a 10 percent [sales increase] at best, but it's not going to be a huge game changer,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zeman said he doesn't believe the Games will persuade people to keep spending more in the long-run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Unfortunately, once the Games finish, then I think people will go back to normal,” he said, adding that the key to bringing back a “vibrant nightlife scene in the city” relies on hosting more international events to attract tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties’ leasing department said the apm mall in Kwun Tong, which is showing the Games, saw an increase in foot traffic of at least 10 percent over Saturday and Sunday, compared to the previous weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fund told an RTHK programme that she believes the public became more engaged with the Olympics from the Tokyo Games, when they enjoyed watching the events together in malls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that he saw a surge in customers at restaurants with televisions on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects a 15 to 20 percent overall increase in business during the Olympics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said his administration has been focusing its attention on economic development and that business is a "win-win" situation for all, as he met with Lao officials as part of his third trip to Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee is leading a delegation to Laos, the first stop of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Cambodia and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee met Laos' deputy prime minister and foreign minister Saleumxay Kommasith, witnessing the signing of a number of memoranda of understanding between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that business is always a win-win situation for the people of both places, and I have been focusing the whole government and society's energy and attention on strengthening economic development and business," Lee said during the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of my visit to Laos on this occasion is, first of all, to strengthen ties between government and government, and of course, strengthen ties between business and business, and also very importantly, strengthen ties between people and people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith, for his part, pointed to a new action plan signed by President Xi Jinping and General-Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Thongloun Sisoulith last year, saying it will be a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith also said the country is committed to working with the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a good opportunity for me and the [Lao People's Democratic Republic], both the government as well as the business community, to discuss and find a way to further expand economic trade cooperation in the [Lao People's Democratic Republic] and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Laotian Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, who welcomed the SAR delegation and called the visit a milestone on economic, cultural, trade and investment cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On social media, the chief executive thanked Laos for supporting Hong Kong's bid for accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the volume of trade and investment flows between Laos and Hong Kong have ample room to grow. We see much prospect for deeper collaboration of our economic relations as both economies place importance to the developments of green economy and digital economy," Lee wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three women and two men have been arrested over the suspected murder of a 33-year-old man in Jordan, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man was found unconscious on Pilkem Street on Sunday morning and was later declared dead after being taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they think the alleged attack, which happened after the man left a suspected illegal gambling den at around 2am, could have been linked to a personal dispute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Commander Ching Chi-yan said the force suspects the victim was struck multiple times about the head with a hammer, adding that cracks were found in the back of the man's skull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, 40, and a woman, 32, were arrested on suspicion of murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other women and a man, aged between 34 and 56, were suspected of assisting an offender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five were being held in detention as police continued their investigation.

    Home prices drop to lowest since September 2016

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's home prices have fallen to their lowest level in almost eight years, with analysts predicting a further slump in the property market due to high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Monday showed that private flat prices fell about 1.2 percent in June, pulling the official index down from 305.6 in May to 301.8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices also dropped for the second straight month, plunging to their lowest since September 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, senior director and head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said high interest rates and the inventory of unsold units will continue to affect the city's property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still expect the prices to go down a little bit in the second half of the year. But the price drop will be narrowed, because people are expecting the US to cut the rates later this year, and it will increase the market confidence for some of the buyers... Across the whole year, the price drop will be about five percent," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents rose nearly 0.2 percent month-on-month in June to the highest level in four and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said he expects rents to continue to go up steadily, saying levels are being boosted by the arrival of overseas students and people moving to Hong Kong under talent admission schemes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencer Vivian Kong will inspire young people to follow their dreams and take up sport as a career, according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, took Hong Kong's third ever Olympics gold when she won the individual women's épée in Paris at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the world number one is helping to promote sports development by raising the profile and popularity of fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think fencing as an Olympic sport has to get established among young people... It (Kong's victory) can encourage more people, especially young people, to engage in physical activity and eventually to improve their overall physical and mental health as well," he said on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong pulled out of the Asian Championships quarter-finals last month due to a knee injury, and underwent surgery for torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the fencer was lucky to be able to return to elite level after the injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sports medicine and literature indicates that maybe around 60 to 70 percent of the athletes can return to elite level," he said, adding that full credit for her recovery must go to her medical team for their "very good strategic rehabilitation plan".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some elite players, or maybe like soccer players, if you have an ACL injury, you may end your football career," Louie noted.

      <br/>
      <br/>

        Hong Kong's skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Olympic races. The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edna O'Brien, the radical Irish writer whose groundbreaking first novel "The Country Girls" was burned and banned in her native country, has died, her publisher announced on Sunday. She was 93.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She died peacefully on Saturday 27 July after a long illness," said a statement from publishers Faber Books posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faber called her "one of the greatest writers of our age."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish President Michael D Higgins said he had learned of the death of his "dear friend" O'Brien with "great sorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was "one of the outstanding writers of modern times" and "a fearless teller of truths," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "While the beauty of her work was immediately recognised abroad, it is important to remember the hostile reaction it provoked among those who wished for the lived experience of women to remain far from the world of Irish literature, with her books shamefully banned upon their early publication."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The honours she eventually received from her native Ireland included the Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Country Girls" (1960), about the sexual initiation of rebellious Catholic girls, drawn from O'Brien's childhood experiences, is now a marker in modern Irish literature for its breaking of social and sexual taboos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Brien was born in 1930 into a strict Catholic farming family in west Ireland's County Clare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was educated at a convent school and then in Dublin where she graduated with a pharmacist's licence in 1950, around the time she was discovering a passion for Leo Tolstoy, F Scott Fitzgerald and TS Eliot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2018, she won the prestigious PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, honoured for having broken down "social and sexual barriers for women in Ireland and beyond."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2021, France made her a Commander in the "Ordre des Arts et des Lettres," the nation's highest cultural distinction. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey made it to the women’s 200m freestyle final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first 100 metres, Haughey maintained a steady top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to narrow the gap and finished third in the second semi-final of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 minute, 55.51 seconds was the fourth fastest overall, earning her one of eight spots in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final will take place in the early hours of Tuesday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey’s main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday, and Ariarne Titmus, who holds the world and Olympic records in the event and defended her title in the 400m free on the first day of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m free at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and won the world title in the 200 freestyle earlier this year.

    Canada teams subdue Jasper fire but not nearby blazes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two melted chairs are all that remain of this lodge in the town of Jasper. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763605_1_20240729044616.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The wildfires that destroyed nearly a third of the beloved tourist town of Jasper in western Canada are now under control, but firefighters are still battling other nearby blazes that could go on for months, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fires, touched off on Monday by lightning strikes in a drought-stricken area, are the biggest to hit the vast Jasper National Park in a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 30 percent of the structures in the town of Jasper – a popular tourist destination considered a scenic "jewel" of the Canadian Rockies – have been destroyed, though no deaths have been reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are anticipating that all remaining fires within the townsite will be extinguished today," Parks Canada, the government agency that manages the country's national parks, said on Sunday on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 25,000 residents and tourists were evacuated from Jasper beginning late on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parks Canada said teams working in Jasper on Sunday were continuing to secure the town's perimeter to prevent new outbreaks and protect critical infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters – their numbers bolstered by some 400 colleagues from New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa – were using a helicopter to spot and extinguish any flare-ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the town and the national park remain under evacuation orders. Royal Canadian Mounted Police are patrolling the area, limiting access to "incident staff and critical contractors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town will be reopened only "when the risk of wildfire activity is significantly reduced," Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Landon Shepherd, an agency official, said bringing the fire under control throughout the national park would "not be easy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) of forestland have gone up in smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout Alberta, 135 wildfires remained active on Sunday, about a quarter of them deemed out of control, Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 185 miles (300 kilometres) to the south of Jasper, in British Columbia province, residents of Slocan, a village of some 600 houses, have also had to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As in the United States, Canada's western region has been hard-hit by wildfires this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Repeated heat waves and dry conditions, both likely linked to global climate change, are believed to be key factors, scientists say. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Adam Peaty was denied in his bid to became the first person to win three consecutive 100m breaststroke titles at the Olympic Games, finishing joint second with America's Nick Fink in a time of 59.05 seconds at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top honours went to Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi who was only 0.02 seconds faster than the Brit and American in a relatively slow final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the second night of swimming got off to a great start for hosts France as swim star Leon Marchand dominated the field in the men's 400m individual medley to win in a new Olympic record time of 4 minutes, 02.95 seconds, just shy of his world mark of 4 minutes, 02.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand was ahead as soon as his head popped from the water and he steadily pulled away from the field in what was essentially two separate races: Marchand racing the clock and everyone else competing for silver and bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The silver went to Japan's Tomoyuki Matsushita, who finished nearly 6 seconds behind the winner in 4 minutes, 08.62 seconds. American Carson Foster claimed the bronze a fraction of a second behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was crazy. I think I will remember this one for a very long time," said Marchand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The emotions are very difficult to describe. It was incredible for a swimmer. I opened my eyes, listened to everything that was happening around. And that really pushed me to already have a great race and have a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, it was a US one-two in the women's 100 metres butterfly as Torri Huske stunned her American teammate and world-record holder Gretchen Walsh to clinch the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh turned first, but Huske came home strongly to touch in 55.59 seconds, with Walsh second in 55.63 and China's Zhang Yufei taking bronze in 56.21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't really remember my race that much. My first 50 felt good, and then I've been really working on my second 50 a lot, especially after last year," said Huske.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian defending champion Maggie Mac Neil finished fifth and Australia's Emma McKeon, the queen of the pool in Tokyo with seven medals, came sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In semi-final action, China's Tang Qianting is ranked fourth going into the women's 100m breaststroke final later on Monday while Yang Junxuan is fifth seed going into the women's 200 free. On the men's side, Xu Jiayu qualified first in the 100m backstroke. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's badminton pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have staved off elimination from the Paris Olympics, after beating their American counterparts in a grueling match in the early hours of Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR shuttlers recovered a day after losing their opener against a pair from Bulgaria, to beat US twins Kerry and Annie Xu 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by eight points at one point, the SAR duo went on a 12-4 run to close the first game 24-22, saving four game points in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xus fought one back, 21-17, taking advantage of the Hong Kong pair's mistakes in quick succession towards the end of the second game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As fatigue appeared to affect the Americans more, the Hong Kong shuttlers won the decider, 21-11, for their first point of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yeungs will battle Team China's Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the SAR loses, the pair will need the Americans to beat the Bulgarian sisters, Gabriela and Stefani Stoeva, by a wide margin for them to have a chance to advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah has evacuated positions in south and east Lebanon after Israeli threats of reprisals for a deadly strike on the annexed Golan Heights, a source close to the group said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to "hit the enemy hard" a day after rocket fire from Lebanon killed 12 young people in Majdal Shams, again raising fears that the war in Gaza will spread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah movement for firing a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket but the Iran-backed group – which has regularly targeted Israeli military positions – said it had "no connection" to the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in the south and in the Bekaa valley that it thinks could be a target for Israel," the source close to the group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has a strong presence in east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, which borders Syria, and in south Lebanon, from where it has been launching near daily attacks on Israeli positions since October in support of ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cross-border exchanges of fire have largely been limited to the border area, but Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside Lebanon, including overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah is also deployed in Syria, where for years it has been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said pro-Iran groups and Hezbollah-affiliated fighters have "evacuated their positions" south of the capital and in the Damascus countryside, as well as in parts of the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights, in anticipation of "potential Israeli airstrikes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had already abandoned positions in Syria in early June after Israeli raids, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including from Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids also seek to cut off Hezbollah supply routes to Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's raids on Syria intensified after Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip, then eased after an April 1 strike blamed on Israel hit the Iranian consular building in Damascus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strike prompted Iran to launch a first-ever direct missile and drone attack against Israel on April 13-14, sending regional tensions skyrocketing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's dominance of Olympic skateboarding continued in Paris on Sunday as World No.1 Coco Yoshizawa won the women's street competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot, and the second highest ranked in the competition, Liz Akama, took silver while Brazil's Rayssa Leal overcame a poor start to the competition to win the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Cui Chenxi finished just outside the medals in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen-year-old Yoshizawa held her arms out wide after sliding down the rail in the highest-scoring attempt of the best-trick stage of the competition, as an enthusiastic crowd at the La Concorde venue cheered wildly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Akama, who had a slim lead heading into the best trick portion of the competition, nailed a sublime 270 switch front board on her opening trick but could not improve on that effort. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting are one win away from a medal at the Paris Olympics, after advancing to the mixed doubles semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They defeated Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao of Spain 4-2 in the quarter-finals on Sunday at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair dropped the first game 9-11, but they won the next two games 11-9 and 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth game saw a suspenseful back and forth with the Spanish team securing that game 12-10, but Doo and Wong fought back in the next game winning 11-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team ultimately took the win 11-8 in the last game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the final four is Hong Kong's best result in this event and Wong said they were glad to have made the breakthrough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I'm just excited like everyone else is. Because at the previous games we went out in the last eight, and now we've made a breakthrough to enter the semifinals," he told reporters post-game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very difficult match. We've lost to them before. This time we gained our revenge. Ah Doo performed very well on the table. I trusted her 120 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Doo, it was the perfect tonic after losing her first-round singles match earlier in the day to North Korea's Pyon Song-gyong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo will square off against the North Korean team again in the semis on Monday when she and Wong face Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong at 10pm Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Koreans had defeated the world number two pair of Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan in an earlier round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Paris Olympics races on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They started off with 17 points in the first race, and improved to 12 points in the second. The final event of the day didn't turn out as well, as the pair finished with 19 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sailors with the fewest points win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China's pair of Wen Zaiding and Liu Tian are tenth after race day one, while New Zealanders Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie have taken the top spot so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The medal rounds are due to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<div class="itemFullText">
 George Russell won the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa on Sunday holding off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton in a stunning Mercedes 1-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri came home in third with pole-sitter Charles Leclerc of Ferrari in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started in 11th, finished fifth, extending his championship lead over the second McLaren of Lando Norris who finished one place further back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell began the race in sixth place and hit the front after opting for a one-stop pit strategy which saw him nursing his second set of tyres for 34 of the race's 44 laps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We definitely didn't predict this win in our strategy meeting this morning," said Russell for whom this was a third grand prix win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One-two for the team was awesome and what a way to go to the break."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen leads the championship race with 275 points, 78 clear of Norris. Red Bull lead the constructors' championship 42 points ahead of McLaren.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans booed a Dutch beach volleyball player convicted of raping an underage girl as he played his first match at the Paris Olympics, where his controversial selection has put the sport in the spotlight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven van de Velde, now 29, was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He walked onto centre court Sunday with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday morning to cheers and applause, with many orange-clad Dutch fans standing to clap the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he was introduced individually over the loudspeaker, however, there was a loud chorus of boos from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sporadic boos as he served throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player has won the backing of his country's national Olympic committee, and exchanged a warm hug with teammate Immers before the start of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his selection has drawn outrage among women's and sports safety groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the player would be separated from his teammates, not stay in the athletes' village, and forbidden from speaking to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His teammate Immers told reporters after the match that they had been "disappointed" by all the focus on van de Velde's past conviction, particularly after a "hard fight" to qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know the guy for two, three years together and we played every tournament," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me that's a big example that you grew, you learned a lot from it. What happened in the past... it's not good of course. But right now we are trying to enjoy and go to the next round," Immers added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ju'Riese Colon, chief executive of the US-based Center for SafeSport, said she was "deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate" in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With teams from around the world convening in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety," she said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Incumbent Nicolas Maduro has warned of a "bloodbath" if he loses. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763576_1_20240728223317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelans voted on Sunday between continuity in President Nicolas Maduro or change in rival Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia amid high tension following the incumbent's threat of a "bloodbath" if he loses, which polls suggest is likely.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With several international observers blocked from entering the South American country at the last minute, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for all parties to "respect the democratic process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Venezuelan people deserve an election that genuinely reflects their will, free from any manipulation. The international community is going to be watching this very closely," Blinken told reporters in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long queues of voters formed at several voting stations hours before polls opened at 6:00 am (1000 GMT). Polls close at 6:00 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have been here since 4:30 in the morning, and I hope it will be a successful day," lawyer Griselda Barroso, 54, said in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope there is democracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro, 61, is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is seeking a third six-year term at the helm of the once wealthy petro-state that saw GDP drop 80 percent in a decade, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a message published on social media overnight, Maduro urged Venezuelans to "Vote, vote, vote, and peace will triumph."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, called on his compatriots to turn out in large numbers "to transform your future" in what "will undoubtedly be the most important democratic expression of the people in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope and wish that everything will transpire in peace," he said in a video posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro lags far behind Gonzalez Urrutia in voter intention, according to independent polls, but counts on a loyal electoral machinery, military leadership and state institutions in a system of well-established political patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relying on its own figures, the government is also said to be certain of victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls suggest Sunday's vote poses the biggest threat yet to 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Maduro's predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chavez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts say the president is unlikely to concede defeat, especially in the absence of immunity guarantees, with his government under investigation for human rights abuses by the International Criminal Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Days before the vote, Maduro said the outcome would decide whether Venezuela enters a period of "peace or war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they do not want Venezuela to become a bloodbath, a fratricidal civil war produced by the fascists, let us guarantee the greatest success, the greatest electoral victory of our people," he said at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments drew condemnation from leaders including Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said: "Maduro has to learn: if you win, you stay. If you lose, you go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns were further stoked when Caracas blocked several international observers, including four ex-presidents who had their plane held up in Panama on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, a Venezuelan NGO said the government was holding 305 "political prisoners" and had arrested 135 people with links to the opposition campaign since January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caracas accuses the opposition of conspiring against Maduro, whose 2018 reelection was rejected as illegitimate by most Western and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Years of tough US sanctions failed to dislodge the president, who enjoys support from Cuba, Russia and China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has repeatedly vowed that he won't cede power now even as Venezuelans clamour for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government blames sanctions, but observers point the finger at corruption and mismanagement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 21 million Venezuelans are registered to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has deployed tens of thousands of security forces and enforced ramped-up border control and a prohibition on public gatherings and protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the election in Venezuela will hardly be free or fair, Venezuelans have their best chance in over a decade to elect their government," Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus said this week, urging the international community to "have their (voters') back." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The maiden Olympic journeys of two SAR fencers, Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho, came to an end on Sunday, but both earned praise from their coaches for their strong performances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nineteen-year-old Chan bowed out of the women's foil individual event after she was beaten 15-8 by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16 at the Grand Palais in Paris. It's still the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong competitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sauer seized a 5-4 advantage after a back-and-forth first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world No 6 from Germany continued to impress in the second round, extending the lead to 10-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was too big a deficit for Chan, ranked 31st in the world, to overcome, but she said after the match that making it this far is already a huge accomplishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy I could reach top 16 and I think I enjoyed the stage so much, the atmosphere was amazing, and I'm very happy that I completed my first Olympics in a really good way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her coach Gregory Koenig applauded the teenage fencer for her performance, adding that Chan has the capability to compete at the highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know people can be disappointed because she doesn't bring a medal to Hong Kong. But we have to be honest, she fenced very well. She showed us she has the ability to have an amazing mindset for this kind of event, at 19 years old, her first Olympic Games," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Psychologically, she can be a great champion. Now she still has to work on the technical skills, the tactical skills, all the physical part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When all these are perfectly set out, if she can keep this mindset, she can really be in the top of the world and bring a medal in the next Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan had edged out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Hong Kong Olympic debutant, Cedric Ho, lost to Masaru Yamada of Japan 15-9 in the men's épée.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho was off to a quick start in their round of 32 match, racing to a 5-2 lead at the end of the first period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamada rallied in the next period, tying the score at 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer faltered in the third and final period which his Japanese opponent won 7-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all the times I have competed against him, I have never had a lead of more than five points. After the draw, I knew he was difficult to beat, but I wanted to try my best," Ho said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a big lead before I was overtaken, which I regret."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said Ho gave an exceptional performance despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that he was himself. That's the most important thing," he said. "The only regret is he didn't believe enough. My old coach used to say these are the moments you are more afraid of winning than losing."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pauline Ferrand-Prevot delivered France's second gold medal of the Paris Olympics as she took a high-quality field apart to win the women's cross-country mountain bike race on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old produced a devastating acceleration at the start of the second of seven laps around the dusty 4.4 kilometre circuit on Elancourt Hill and rode solo to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haley Batten of the US and Jenny Rissveds of Sweden were involved in a fierce scrap for silver with Batten bursting clear to finish runner-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Young Dutchwoman Puck Pieterse was the only rider who looked capable of making it a race and was alone in second place when she suffered a puncture on lap five and needed a wheel change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrand-Prevot, who will return to road racing after the Olympics, is a five-times cross-country world champion but suffered heartbreak at the last two Olympics when favourite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in front of thousands of flag-waving French fans in the countryside near Versailles she reigned supreme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe it, I've worked so hard for this day that I was like a robot today," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so huge that I don't know what to say. In the final lap it was easier to enjoy it." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni vowed on Sunday to "relaunch" cooperation with China, signing a three-year action plan during her first official visit to Beijing since taking office, Italian news agency ANSA reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meloni made the announcement during a meeting with Premier Li Qiang, as Rome seeks to improve trade ties with Beijing after it exited the Belt and Road infrastructure investment scheme last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian leader said her five-day trip was a "demonstration of the will to begin a new phase, to relaunch our bilateral cooperation", ANSA reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action plan will aim to experiment with new forms of cooperation, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meloni, who sees Chinese investment as a way to spur Italy's anaemic economic growth, will meet President Xi Jinping and National People's Congress Standing Committee chairman Zhao Leji.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also attended an Italy-China business forum, to which companies including Italian tyre-maker Pirelli, energy group ENI, defence group Leonardo, wine producers and several Italian luxury fashion groups such as Dolce & Gabbana were invited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forum gives "another signal of the mutual interest... (to) balance more our interests, our commercial exchange," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and Italy should adopt a win-win mentality and increase trade and investment cooperation, making cooperation even more dynamic and sustainable," said Premier Li at the opening of the forum, according to a video shared by Meloni's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bilateral trade and industrial agreements are expected to be signed during Meloni's trip, a source close to the planning has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, Italy became the only Group of Seven country to join the massive Belt and Road Initiative but withdrew last year under US pressure over concerns about Beijing's economic reach. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday booked a place in the women's 200m freestyle semifinals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey came second in her heat, 0.10 secs behind China's Li Bingjie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 min 56.38 secs was the fifth fastest overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey will compete in the semifinals, early Monday Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the SAR swimmer's main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay, as well as Ariarne Titmus, fresh from winning the 400m freestyle. Titmus also holds the world and Olympic records for the women's 200m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m freestyle in the Tokyo Games three years ago.

 Hong Kong fencer Daphne Chan made a winning Olympic debut on Sunday at the Grand Palais in Paris, edging out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the women’s foil individual round of 32.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan scored an early point in the next round to extend her lead, but Azuma refused to go quietly, picking up a few points to tie the score at 11 at the end of the second period.

  The third and final period was also a closely fought battle, with the 19-year-old SAR fencer emerging victorious over her Japanese rival ranked 19 places above her.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem was on Sunday eliminated in the first round of the women's singles at the Paris Olympics, losing 4-1 to North Korea's Pyon Song Gyong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time SAR Olympian started off the round of 64 match losing two straight games 8-11 and 7-11, before fighting back and winning the third 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the North Korean won two more games 11-7 and 11-4 and sent Doo packing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Doo, who won bronze as part of the SAR's women's team at the Tokyo Games, will play in the mixed doubles quarter-finals with teammate Wong Chun-ting later on Sunday. They will take on the Spanish duo of Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao for a spot in the semi-finals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said there were larger crowds on Sunday at Prince Edward station than normal because of a partial suspension of services, but made it clear crowd-control measures were in place to facilitate travel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rail company suspended services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on the Kwun Tong Line to carry out large-scale tunnel asset renewal work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations – Prince Edward, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei and Ho Man Tin – are still being served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line, while Prince Edward is the only interchange station between the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at Yau Ma Tei station, Cheris Lee, the MTR's chief of operating and metro segment, says staff have been told to be proactive in assisting passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she believed the impact of suspension will be minimised, with the maintenance work being carried out on a Sunday during the summer vacation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Passengers can still use our alternative routes to all stations today," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR deployed more than 1,000 staff to facilitate operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement later in the day, the firm described the overall situation on Sunday as smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One passenger, surnamed Wong, said the suspension should have happened on a weekday, given the number of mainland tourists and foreign domestic helpers who were off on Sunday. "At least during the weekdays, there will be fewer people, at least fewer mainlanders... this (the suspension along with the rain) would create a more negative impact to Hong Kong's image," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR also reminded passengers who are travelling to Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line to be 20 to 30 minutes early, to ensure they'll catch the last train.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Sunday advanced to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls at the Paris Olympics after finishing second in his repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR rower was in second place through the first 500 metres, but dropped to third for the next kilometre. He picked up the pace in the final stretch and overtook Bermuda's Dara Alizadeh for second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have earned the respect of many competitors, because they thought Hong Kong's rowing team might not be able to perform well and be competitive in open events. But I showed them that I was capable to reach the quarterfinals," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had finished out of the running in Saturday's heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterfinals are set to be held on Tuesday.

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Sunday said Hong Kong will be exploring business opportunities in emerging economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) bloc.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came as Chief Executive John Lee embarked on a visit to the Asean member states of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Yau said Hong Kong can offer professional services to these countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can bring in a lot of professional services to these countries, to help their economic development. These countries have a very strong relationship with China. With this relationship, I think there are a lot of opportunities there."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister also said the government may set up more Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) in Asean countries, in addition to the existing ones in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday began a six-day trip to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to further explore business opportunities there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport before leaving for Laos, Lee said he will persuade the three Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries to back Hong Kong's inclusion in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meet with local leaders to introduce Hong Kong's economic development and opportunities, and I will continue to seek their support for us to join the RCEP," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second, we will promote economic and trade exchanges in different regions. We will present Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a 'super value-adder,' showcasing what we can offer such as professional services, our experience, our connections, and how we can guide them to benefit from opportunities in Hong Kong and also enter the mainland market and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted that the combined population of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam totals around 120 million, describing them as a huge market and business prospect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's delegation includes some 30 leaders from various business and technology sectors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the upcoming economic figures indicate sustained growth in Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a blog post, Chan said the government will this week unveil GDP figures for the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that both exports and investments have shown continual growth, attributed to an uptick in external demand and a surge in the nation's overall exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the finance minister expressed optimism that challenges from geopolitics will likely diminish, which will benefit investment and asset markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the stable growth of the mainland economy will provide significant support to Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that a series of exhibitions and large-scale events will bring in more tourists and consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the finance chief congratulated épée fencer Vivian Kong for securing Hong Kong's first Paris Olympics gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said Kong has showcased her exceptional skills and perseverance in her comeback victory, making all Hongkongers thrilled and excited.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China shaded Japan in men's artistic gymnastics qualifying at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with all-around leader Zhang Boheng hailing his team's spirit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a frenetic first day's action at Bercy Arena, a boisterous crowd was treated to a taste of the thrills and spills ahead, with American superstar Simone Biles making her eagerly awaited entrance on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian Olympic Committee won the men's team title at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games but Russian gymnasts are not defending their title, leaving China as favourites to take gold for the first time since London 2012 on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by Olympic debutant Zhang, China topped the team qualifying standings by 2.434 points from Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain, featuring world vault champion Jake Jarman and double Olympic pommel horse gold medallist Max Whitlock, were third ahead of Ukraine and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang topped the individual all-around table from Japan's Shinnosuke Oka and defending champion Daiki Hashimoto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy with that, it's my highest score in a major competition this year" said Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our team performed excellently. Everyone did very well and showed great team spirit." (AFP)

  Here are the top stories:
  <br/>

   Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong, who had been 7-1 down in the second period, struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.

    <br/>
    <br/>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Meanwhile in the swimming pool, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia began their Olympic swim campaign with two golds while the United States stamped their authority in the men's 4x100 metres freestyle relay to win in a time of 3 minutes, 9.28 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia took silver and Italy won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's relay capped an exciting night of Olympic swimming at La Defense Arena, which began when Germany's Lukas Maertens surged to victory in the men's 400 metres freestyle gold medal, narrowly missing the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old was under world record pace for 350 metres before fading in the final stretch to touch in 3 minutes, 41.78 seconds ahead of Australia's Elijah Winnington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korean 2024 world champion Kim Woo-min took bronze in 3 minutes, 42.50 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maertens was overcome with emotion after his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Means everything to me -- you can see my progress in performance... I am extremely happy and just overwhelmed," said Maertens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't put into words what I am feeling now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 400 metres freestyle final wasn't as fast as expected but it saw defending champion and world record holder Ariarne Titmus stamp her dominance from the get go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian led from start to finish to win in 3 minutes 57.49 seconds, holding off the challenge from Canada's Summer McIntosh who took silver while US star Katie Ledecky grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just happy to get the result for myself and I feel so honoured to be a part of the race and be alongside legends like Katie," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look up to her so much as an athlete and there's certainly not a rivalry beyond the races. I really respect her as a person and I hope that I put on a good show tonight and everyone enjoyed it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia also claimed their fourth consecutive gold in the women's 400 freestyle relay in an Olympic record time of 3 minutes, 28.92 seconds as the Dolphins out fought their American rivals who took silver in an Americas record time while China won bronze with a new Asian mark. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Engineers from national rail operator SNCF repair cables damaged in the attacks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763483_1_20240728042748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's national rail operator on Saturday said train travel was gradually returning to normal after multiple sabotage acts paralysed the network hours ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It remains unclear who carried out the three attacks overnight Thursday to Friday on rail infrastructure and if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Olympics opening ceremony that took place later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a message of support for the sabotage was sent to several media outlets on Saturday, which also criticised the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through a second day of cancelled and delayed trains on Saturday with 160,000 of the 800,000 people due to travel on a major holiday getaway weekend still facing cancellations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said national rail operator SNCF had mobilised a hundred workers overnight to repair the damage "in difficult weather conditions" and ensure a return to normal for Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the night, "with floodlights, in the rain, they patched up the wires one by one," said SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything will be repaired by Monday morning" on the SNCF network, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fibre optic cables running near the tracks and ensuring the transmission of safety information for drivers, such as signalling lights and points, were cut and set on fire during the night from Thursday to Friday on three of the main TGV lines, in the west, north and east of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No claim of responsibility has been made for the meticulously planned night-time attacks. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a statement sent to several news media expressed support for the sabotage and criticised the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They call it a festival? We see it as a celebration of nationalism, a gigantic stating of the subjugation of populations by states," said the email received by the newspaper La Provence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the headline of the message said, "claim to sabotage," no details of the action were provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was signed by "an unexpected delegation" and was sent via the online platform Riseup, whose users include those advocating for social change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris prosecutors on Friday opened a probe into an attack on "fundamental national interests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observers have noted that the nature of the attacks indicate the culprits would have needed deep knowledge of the functioning of the railways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the investigation was progressing, as he also expressed "relief" that the opening ceremony had taken place without any mishap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Darmanin told France 2 television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was "too early" to say who was behind the attack. "It could have come from inside (France) or from the outside."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities are on high alert for a terrorist attack during the Games, which run through August 11. Tens of thousands of police and troops are on security duties during the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250,000 people missed their train on Friday, according to SNCF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three out of every 10 trains were cancelled on Saturday in the three regions affected by the attacks, with most trains still operating delayed by between one and two hours, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one third of trains were cancelled in northern, western and eastern France. About a quarter of Eurostar high speed trains between Paris and London and Paris and Brussels were also called off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With normal services set to be fully restored on Monday, the situation is already expected to improve markedly on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine out of 10 TGV high speed trains will be able to run on the western and southwestern lines on Sunday, while service will be more patchy in the north, where seven out of 10 trains are due to run, SNCF said. Trains to eastern France have not been affected. (AFP)
