<div class="itemFullText">
 Salary increases this year are slightly lower than last year, according to a new report by Jobsdb.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The employment platform polled nearly 3,400 workers between February and  March, and found that their average pay rise in 2024 was 3.2 percent. That's almost one percentage point lower than last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employees in analytics had the biggest increase at 7.2 percent, followed by legal and compliance, and engineering at about five percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers in the design, retail sales and manufacturing sectors were at the bottom end with increments of less than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, said the lower pay rise should not be a concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is roughly within the range of salary increases in Hong Kong in the last ten years, and this number is also above inflation, which was roughly around two percent in March,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that industries like hospitality and tourism had benefited from the rebounded in visitor numbers, and their staff had a better than average salary rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We do see a significant improvement in the salary and benefits package within the hospitality and tourism job functions. Firstly, within this segment, there's an average increase of 4.2 percent," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And over 80 percent of those surveyed within this segment actually received salary increments, so that's a pretty positive outlook.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said that jobseekers, particularly those under 25, had shown more interest in working on the mainland which has become the second most popular destination after Australia for Hongkongers seeking work outside the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The policies implemented by the Hong Kong government to encourage more integration with the Greater Bay Area are probably showing some results, increasing the awareness of young people looking to work in the GBA,” he said.

    RAISe+ results will be published soon: Paul Chan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government will soon release the results of a scheme aimed at promoting the commercialisation of scientific research results and matching university projects with reliable investors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Greater Bay Area Science Forum - Hong Kong Forum at the University of Hong Kong, Chan said the authorities have been rolling out various measures to promote the commercialisation of scientific research results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the measures, he said, is the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) that was launched last October and is aimed at promoting collaboration between the government, universities, as well as the technology and research industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very pleased to report to you that the results of the first round of evaluation results of the scheme will be published within this month, and we will fund over 20 projects covering various fields, including health and medical sciences, new materials, new energy, and artificial intelligence robots et cetera,” Chan told the participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that authorities will also conduct more collaboration with cities in the Greater Bay Area, especially the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, to create a vigorous technology and innovation ecosystem, while matching global capital with scientific institutions and universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the government will prepare and establish a third InnoHK research and development cluster in the second half of this year, to ramp up the SAR's tech transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new cluster will focus on advanced manufacturing, materials, energy, and sustainable development, while the existing clusters focus on healthcare-related technologies, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, could play a positive role in guiding funds by being a ‘super connector’. The innovation and technology industries as well as the finance industry in the Greater Bay Area can support each other, and they are equivalent to combining the competitive strengths of the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that over 50 key enterprises, many in the innovation and tech fields, have been attracted to the SAR since late 2022, and it's estimated they will bring in investments worth more than HK$40 billion and create 13,000 jobs in the coming few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 120,000 individuals have recently arrived in the SAR via the government’s various talent import schemes, with 20 percent of them working in the innovation and technology industries, Chan said.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754012_1_20240521112929.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee urged people without proper training to refrain from mounting sting operations, after taxi drivers went undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cabbies raised eyebrows and caused controversy by travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police had been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee warned there were risks for people taking matters into their own hands, and that they should refer the issue to law enforcement officers instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These operations should be undertaken by law enforcement agencies. And the law enforcement agencies that take these undercover actions will have to abide by rules and regulations. The officers involved have been well-trained. They act within the framework of the law," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need training to handle emergency situations. Without proper training and without adequate legal understanding, I advise people not to do it, because they may break the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted the Transport and Logistics Bureau would report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services in July.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that clear key performance indicators (KPIs) must be set for the development and operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, adding that government money must be spent carefully.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment ahead of the weekly Exco meeting after the chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, said museums at the arts hub may have to reduce the days they are open unless more funds are secured in the next year or so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government is in communication with the authority regarding viable funding options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have high expectations of the successful operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, and it has been creating value for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In many areas, it has been doing a job which satisfies the expectations and wishes of the community and the government, but we want to ensure that there will be a long-term viable financing plan with good KPIs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that the district was designed to be self-financing following its initial endowment from the government.

    Govt to release findings on waste charging next week

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government attached importance to people's views on the waste charging scheme, as officials prepare to present their plans to the Legislative Council next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a survey by the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao found that more than 90 percent of the 30,000 people polled were against the pay-as-you-throw scheme, while more than 70 percent said it should be scrapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme has been on trial since April in 14 different locations, including at homes, shops and restaurants. Officials had previously said it remained to be seen whether a full roll-out would take place as planned on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the government was assessing the experience gained during the trial and the challenges that may arise in implementing the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed the government was taking the views of society seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In my opinion, a policy that would affect more than seven million citizens should be carefully considered. Even though the law was drafted before this government took office, we should still consider how to implement it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will explain to the Legislative Council next week what we have learnt from the pilot, the problems we have identified and the feedback we have received from the community, including through the media."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said internet service providers have been complying with a court injunction against the protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said hyperlinks to the song could no longer be found on local platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've noted that there's no link shown on any local platform relating to the song, and also Google Search doesn't show any link to the song in question either," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to monitor the situation to see whether there is any non-compliance with the court order. If we notice such instances, then we will notify the platform on the contents of the court order."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction against the protest song, banning anyone with seditious intent from playing or performing it on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said last week that it would comply with the court ruling, restricting viewing of 32 banned links related to the song in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host dozens more mega events this year which were expected to draw millions of visitors, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's leader also said arts and culture shows, sports competitions, trade exhibitions and financial summits would be among the more than 100 events held in the latter half of the year, including brand new ones such as a performing arts expo and a fashion design week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The total number of mega events over the year is increased from 150 to [over] 210. That means there will be [at least] one mega event every two days," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think that these mega events will attract about 1.7 million visitors. They will bring with them about HK$7.2 billion, which is about HK$4.3 billion in economic gain.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said Hong Kong welcomed more than 14 million visitors in the first four months, double from the same period a year ago, and that there was a surge of tourists coming from the United States, Canada and Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We reckon that for every 1.5 million visitors, there will be a 0.1 percent growth in GDP. For long-term stay visitors, they will bring even a higher percentage point in growth of our GDP," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added his administration would seek more measures from Beijing that benefits the SAR, including raising the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Saudi Public Investment Fund [PIF] will become the first-ever naming partner of the WTA's rankings, the two organisations announced on Monday, as part of a multi-year partnership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement marks the PIF's latest foray into tennis, after the men's ATP tour also signed a multi-year "strategic partnership" earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we look forward to sharing the journey of our talented players across the season, as we continue to grow the sport, creating more fans of tennis and inspiring more young people to take up the game," WTA Ventures CEO Marina Storti said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement marks the latest move in a dramatic shift by the women's tour, which was previously reluctant to embrace Saudi partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outgoing CEO Steve Simon said last year that Saudi Arabia posed "big issues" as a host for women's tennis events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was announced in April that the season-ending WTA Finals will be held in the Saudi capital Riyadh from 2024-2026, with the Saudi Tennis Federation offering record prize money of US$15.25 million this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came despite pushback from retired greats Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, while Russian Daria Kasatkina, who came out as gay in 2022, also expressed reservations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's rights activists and members of the LGBTQ community accused the country of "sports-washing", criticising Saudi Arabia's human rights record as it pumps huge amounts of money into soccer, Formula One and the LIV Golf circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed AlSayyad, head of corporate brand at PIF, said the organisation would "continue to be a catalyst for the growth of women’s sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with the WTA to increase participation and inspire the next generation of talent," he said in a statement. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said on Monday that the bodies of four hostages retrieved from Gaza last week were found in tunnels under Jabalia, where troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The army said last week it had recovered the bodies of Ron Benjamin, Yitzhak Gelerenter, Shani Louk, and Amit Buskila, all of whom it said had been killed in Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their remains were recovered "from underground tunnels in Jabalia in northern Gaza," the army said late on Monday in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a military operation, Israeli soldiers searched a suspected building in which a tunnel shaft was located, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Soldiers then entered the underground tunnel route in a night operation and inside it conducted combat," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the fighting the soldiers "located the bodies of the hostages and rescued them from the tunnels," the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four were taken hostage during the attack on the Nova music festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the event held near Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fighters from Hamas crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the more than 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 124 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 35,562 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since early May the Israeli military has been engaged in renewed street battles in northern and central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the army said that the fighting in the northern town of Jabalia was "perhaps the fiercest" in over seven months of war. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gains by several large tech companies pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record on Monday, on an overall mixed day for US equities as weakness at JPMorgan Chase dragged down the Dow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Microsoft climbed 1.2 percent as it unveiled new PC offerings that feature generative artificial intelligence tools built directly into its Windows operating system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip giant Nvidia also advanced ahead of its earnings release due later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JPMorgan slumped 4.5 percent, with analysts attributing the decline to CEO Jamie Dimon signalling he is closer to retiring from the US banking giant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 0.7 percent to 16,794, topping last week's record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones, meanwhile, slid 0.5 percent to 39,806, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,308.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Nvidia earnings, this week's calendar includes Federal Reserve minutes from the May 1 meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a mixed session," said Peter Cardillo, of Spartan Capital. "I kind of think it's going to be this way until some new catalyst."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Results from some leading retailers, including Target and Lowe's, are also on this week's plate. Strong results from Walmart last week added to market momentum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other equities, tech company Jabil shot up 5.2 percent after announcing that Michael Dastoor was promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive officer. The company also confirmed its profit forecast. (AFP)

    UK PM 'sorry' for cover-up over infected blood scandal
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The tainted blood scandal has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753958_1_20240521024738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday apologised to thousands of people infected with contaminated blood in a decades-long scandal that a damning report concluded was covered up and largely could have been avoided.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood in Britain between the 1970s and early 1990s, the Infected Blood Inquiry concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 3,000 people died, and more will follow, in what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am truly sorry," Sunak told the House of Commons, calling the findings of the long-awaited report "a day of shame for the British state."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Time and again people in positions of power and trust had the chance to stop the transmission of those infections and failed to do so," he added, promising "whatever it costs" to compensate victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total figure is expected to be above £10 billion (US$12 billion) when the government announces the package on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, running to more than 2,500 pages, laid bare a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one school where 122 pupils with haemophilia were given infected blood products between 1970 and 1987, only 30 now survive, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to report that it could largely, though not entirely, have been avoided," concluded its author, judge Brian Langstaff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His team found that successive governments and health professionals failed to mitigate risks despite it being apparent by the early 1980s that the cause of AIDS could be transmitted by blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blood donors were not screened properly and blood products were imported from abroad, including from the United States where drug users and prisoners were used for donations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Viewing the response of the NHS and of government overall, the answer to the question, 'Was there a cover-up?' is that there has been," the report stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not in the sense of a handful of people plotting in an orchestrated conspiracy to mislead, but in a way that was more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling in its implications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this way there has been a hiding of much of the truth," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of the 3,000 patients who died, many more were left with lifelong health problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Langstaff said that "the scale of what happened is horrifying" and said people's suffering had been compounded by repeated denials and false assurances that they had received good treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I have found is that disaster was no accident. People put their trust in doctors and the government to keep them safe and that trust was betrayed," Langstaff told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Theresa May launched the inquiry – one of the country's largest – in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campaigners hailed the report as the culmination of a decades-long struggle but noted that it came too late for many of the victims who will never see justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Evans, chairman of the Tainted Blood campaign group, described the report as "momentous" and that he felt "validated and vindicated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been gaslit for generations... Sometimes we felt like we were shouting into the wind during the last 40 years," he told reporters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Feyenoord coach Arne Slot was on Monday confirmed as Jurgen Klopp's successor at Liverpool by the Premier League club.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club said in a statement that the Dutchman, 45, would take up the position of head coach on June 1, subject to a work permit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot's arrival has been an open secret, with Liverpool reportedly agreeing a compensation deal worth up to £9.4 million (US$12 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed Anfield was his next destination at his final pre-match press conference at the Eredivisie club on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp announced his departure in January and took charge of his final game on Sunday, a 2-0 win against Wolves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his final speech to the Anfield crowd, the German urged fans to throw their full support behind Slot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me," he said. "You go all-in from the first day. And you keep believing and you push the team." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen has stayed largely composed and on topic during cross-examination. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753952_1_20240521003251.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's trial on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star approached its final stages on Monday, with closing arguments expected early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Due to an upcoming holiday weekend as well as legal squabbles over jury instructions among other yet undisclosed "issues," Judge Juan Merchan told the court "it's become apparent that we are not going to be able to sum up tomorrow" as he had hoped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's still unclear if the defence will present a case – they are not required to – or whether Trump himself will testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most experts say it is highly unlikely he will take the stand in his watershed criminal trial, the first ever of a former US president, as it would expose him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination by prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche has raised the prospect his client could step up as a witness, telling the judge last week "that's another decision we need to consider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the prosecution can rest, defence lawyers will first conclude grilling the state's star witness, Michael Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer turned tormentor, recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over several days of questioning that continued on Monday, Trump's lawyers have set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has also probed Cohen's loyalty both past and present, to Trump and the prosecution respectively, looking to show jurors that the former fixer is self-serving and willing to go to great lengths to accomplish his aims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen has said repeatedly he takes "responsibility" for his actions and has faced the consequences. Prior to the trial, including in his books, he had done little to hide his contempt for his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has striven to ruffle Cohen, who has a reputation for a temper that could hurt him on the stand – but the witness has stayed largely composed and on topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story has generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run. (AFP)

    MTR stations better protected from storm flooding
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR has placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753946_2_20240520220635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR has installed a flood detection system at 26 stations, to prepare for the coming rain and typhoon season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The initiative comes after Wong Tai Sin Station was flooded during a heavy downpour last September, resulting in the partial suspension of the Kwun Tong Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, the MTR’s Chief of Airport Segment, Ben Lui, said the rail giant had placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When water reaches the sensors, it will trigger an alarm to the station staff. Upon receiving the alarm, the staff will check the CCTV to confirm if there is flooding. If there is flooding, our staff will set flood barriers and temporarily cordon off the affected area. There will also be announcements for the public to use other exits to leave the station," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui also said the MTR would suspend all services on above ground sections of the network, including the light railway and airport express, whenever the typhoon signal No. 9 or higher was in effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, if trains were still above ground when the second-highest typhoon signal was raised, they would continue to their designated destinations, or at least to major stations such as Yuen Long or Sha Tin, where passengers could find shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR would also provide water and food for affected passengers under such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang said the newly installed flood sensors at station exits would provide early alerts to MTR staff, enabling them to proactively prevent flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Zhang, who's a former MTR engineer, expressed concerns regarding the safety of station staff who would need to set up flood-proof barriers themselves amid extreme weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even for a small station like Wong Tai Sin, there are more than eight entrances, and each entrance has to be installed with floodblocks manually by the station staff. And the manpower is definitely still a concern and also a constraint," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang said the rail operator was thinking about installing automatic flood-proof barriers at stations to minimise the risks to staff safety.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday won a legal bid to appeal against his extradition from Britain to the United States on espionage charges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  High Court judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson said Assange had grounds to challenge the UK government’s extradition order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange faces 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over his website’s publication of a trove of classified US documents almost 15 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison after taking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyers for Assange argued Monday the US provided “blatantly inadequate” assurances the WikiLeaks founder would have free press protections if extradited to America to face espionage charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said prosecutors had failed to guarantee that Assange, who is an Australian citizen and claims protections as a journalist for publishing US classified information, could rely on press protections of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. (AP)

 The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday said he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in connection with their actions during the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Karim Khan said that he believes Netanyahu, his defence minister Yoav Gallant and three Hamas leaders — Yehya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — were responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking of the Israeli actions, Khan said in a statement that “the effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known...they include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the Hamas actions on October 7, he said he saw for himself "the devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today. Speaking with survivors, I heard how the love within a family, the deepest bonds between a parent and a child, were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness. These acts demand accountability.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s jobless rate remained stable at three percent in the three-month period ending in April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate also remained unchanged, at 1.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 5,700 people were newly employed during the three-month period, bringing the total employment number to 3.69 million. The labour force, meanwhile, increased by about 7,700 to 3.8 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, some 2,000 people became jobless during the period, sending the total number of unemployed to 113,700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of underemployed people stood at 40,500, largely unchanged compared with the previous three-month period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, labour chief Chris Sun said the unemployment rates of various sectors remained low in general, with only small changes observed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects "continued economic growth" to keep the labour market tight in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also noted that there was a monthly average of 75,425 vacancies in the private sector between February and April, which was a decrease of nearly 30 percent on a yearly basis and a drop of 2.7 percent compared with the first three months of the year.

 The Taiwan Affairs Office said the new leader of the Taiwan region, William Lai, sent "a dangerous signal" by seeking "Taiwan independence" and making provocations to undermine cross-strait peace and stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to Lai's speech as he took office on Monday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said while the mainstream public aspiration on the island is for peace and development, Lai has ignored the public opinion, exposing his nature of being "a worker for Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen also said Lai sought independence by relying on foreign support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No matter how the political situation in Taiwan changes, it will not change the historical and legal fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China," Wang said. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Label issued to "smart and safe" construction sites

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau and Construction Industry Council have launched a new programme to encourage the use of the Smart Site Safety System on construction sites, with applications open on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sites that successfully implement the system, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for frontline staff and electric locks for hazardous areas, would now be recognised with a label.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony of the programme, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn explained the participation rate for the safety system, especially for private sites, was still relatively low, and such labels were believed to increase their safety awareness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The programme aims to encourage more construction sites to adopt the Smart Site Safety System by providing them with a label, or a ‘plaque’, to identify and facilitate monitoring of those sites that have properly installed and applied the system,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We estimate that the first batch of about 100 construction sites will receive the label by July this year.  With an estimated minimum of 500 sites participating, we hope to have all labels issued by the end of the year, covering over 60 percent of all construction sites.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said such labels would be displayed at strategic spots outside the construction sites for recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In other words, everyone will know which sites have such labels. For sites that don’t have such labels. Obviously relevant government departments will pay more attention during their usual inspections. And the construction industry will know which sites haven’t implemented the Smart Site Safety System. I believe this will create a certain pressure,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn added that sites should still be cautious even if they have been issued the “plaque”, saying it could still be scrapped if they don't perform site safety properly.

    More mobilised civil servants report on time: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung on Monday said more public servants were able to report for duty on time under a mobilisation protocol used during a government-wide drill on handling emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The exercise last month simulated a situation where a super typhoon was approaching Hong Kong, with civil servants called up to assist residents in low-lying areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said the exercise showed that public servants had improved their internal communication, compared to the first drill held about a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Civil Service Bureau] worked with different bureaus and departments and we were able to contact all staff required within 40 minutes. And the relevant bureaus and departments also, within a short period time, contacted their staff members. So 99 percent of our staff members were able to arrive at the designated locations within a specified time. This shows that the communication mechanism worked," she told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that authorities were able to swiftly deliver supplies from storage facilities set up across the city to specified locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, raised concerns about civil servants having to catch up their usual work after being deployed under the mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Yeung said she believes bureaus and departments would take a "compassionate approach".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Say, if the mobilisation exercise [on a work day] completes at 5.30pm, no staff will be asked to go back to their original post to finish their work. The work will be shared among other colleagues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government-wide mobilisation went into effect twice last year, with hundreds of civil servants deployed to help clear up the aftermath of Super Typhoon Saola as well as following torrential downpours in September.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Monday said the government will not delay plans to start keeping the stock markets open during severe weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after reports suggested the authorities could delay bringing in the change until the end of the year or early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending the China Private Equity Summit, Hui said officials are sticking to the original timeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our timeline has not been changed, and it's been clear the whole time. That is, we'll announce relevant details of the implementation by the middle of this year when we publish the results of the public consultation on this regard,” Hui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And when the markets are ready, we'll start implementing relevant arrangements.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No date for the move has been set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Hui told participants at the summit that Hong Kong remains competitive when it comes to firms raising capital, and authorities will continue to attract leading enterprises from the mainland to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Hui also said the SAR government will publish a policy statement regarding the development of artificial intelligence (AI) by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “AI is already being applied in various areas of banking, securities, insurance, accounting, retirement, protection and green finance in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government will strive to capitalise on the opportunities brought by AI while also managing the risks and challenges.”

    Leave policing to the police: taxi association chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi drivers should not be going undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services and the matter should be left to the police, an industry spokesman said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Videos online appear to show cabbies travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, told RTHK he does not agree with such an approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added, however, that there were only 33 prosecutions over unlicensed ride-hailing services last year and the taxi trade is disappointed with the amount of action taken by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ride-hailing services are legal, but if these companies do not verify whether or not the cars in service have a hire car permit, the insurance of these cars already becomes invalid. This becomes a problem for all road users including third-party vehicles, pedestrians, passengers and even the driver of the ride-hailing car," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there is a serious accident and there's no compensation for casualties, people would criticise the SAR's governance and nobody wants to see that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow said he hopes plans for new fleets of taxis will improve services, leading to less demand for ride-hailing firms.

 China on Monday announced sanctions against three US defence companies for selling arms to Taiwan region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry placed General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Boeing Defence, Space & Security on its "unreliable entities list".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms will be barred from engaging in China-related import or export activities, and are forbidden to make new investments in China. In addition, senior executives of the companies are prohibited from entering China, while their work permits will be revoked, along with their visitor and residential status, and the related applications they submit will not be approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move is the latest in a series of sanctions Beijing has announced in recent years against defence companies for weapons sales to the island. (Xinhua & agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 11 rebounds and the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves overcame a 20-point, third-quarter deficit to beat the Denver Nuggets 98-90 in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Minnesota advances to the Western Conference finals for the first time in 20 years after winning in Denver for the third time in the series. The Timberwolves won Game 7 against the Sacramento Kings in 2004 to reach the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota, the No. 3 seed, hosts No. 5 Dallas in Game 1 on Wednesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 22 points and Anthony Edwards was 6-for-24 shooting but finished with 18 points, eight rebounds and seven assists to end the Nuggets' bid for a second straight NBA title. Rudy Gobert was big down the stretch, scoring eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nikola Jokic had 34 points and 19 rebounds and Jamal Murray scored 35 points for Denver. It is the second time in six seasons the Nuggets have lost a Game 7 at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota took its first lead since the first quarter on Rudy Gobert's floater early in the fourth quarter and stretched it 77-72. Jokic missed his first six 3-pointers but hit two from deep to keep the Nuggets close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naz Reid, who scored 11 points, hit two free throws, blocked Jokic's floater and had a putback dunk. Edwards drained a 3-pointer off a Murray turnover to put the Timberwolves ahead 92-82 with 3:07 left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denver closed within 93-88 with 1:02 left but Towns tip-in sealed Minnesota's trip to the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets staged a 16-0 run spanning the first and second quarters and led 53-38 at halftime. They pushed it to 58-38 early in the third and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a 17-footer that would have made it a 22-point lead.

  The Timberwolves came storming back, using a 19-3 run to get within 61-57 with 3:05 left in the period. Towns hit a pair of free throws to get Minnesota within two, and Edwards drained a 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left to make it 67-66 heading into the fourth. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iranian state media on Monday said President Ebrahim Raisi died after his helicopter crashed in a mountainous region of the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams had been scouring the area since Sunday afternoon after a helicopter carrying Raisi, the foreign minister and other officials had gone missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early Monday, relief workers located the missing helicopter, with state TV saying the president had died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The servant of Iranian nation, Ayatollah Ebrahim Raisi has achieved the highest level of martyrdom whilst serving the people," state television said on Monday, with Mehr news agency also saying he was dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State television broadcast photos of Raisi, with the voice of a man reciting the Koran playing in the background.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's vice president for executive affairs Mohsen Mansouri posted on X a Koranic verse used to express condolences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams had fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in East Azerbaijan province in the early hours of Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Turkish drone had identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopter's wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said earlier on X. Iranian state news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had earlier said it was "deeply concerned" about Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi after his helicopter went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country. (Agencies)

    Schauffele birdies final hole to win at Valhalla

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Schauffele holds The Wanamaker Trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753839_1_20240520081110.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele birdied the final hole to win the PGA Championship by one shot over LIV Golf's Bryson DeChambeau at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday to claim his first major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Schauffele put the finishing touches on a wire-to-wire victory at the year's second major with a closing six-under-par 65 that left him at 21 under on the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Needing a closing birdie for the win, Schauffele's tee shot at the 18th perched up on the edge of a fairway bunker and forced him to take a compromised stance inside the hazard for his second shot, which he left just in front of the green.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele then displayed nerves of steel as he chipped to six feet from where he drained the biggest birdie of his career for the lowest winning score to par at a major championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau carded a bogey-free seven-under-par 64 to finish two shots ahead of Viktor Hovland [66], whose spirited effort to become the first Norwegian to win a major came undone at the final hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A day that began with seven players within four strokes of overnight co-leaders Schauffele and Collin Morikawa turned into a thrilling three-horse race across the back nine at Valhalla between Schauffele, DeChambeau and Hovland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau and Hovland were playing in the third-to-last pairing and each set up pressure-packed 10-foot birdie putts on the final hole. DeChambeau drained his but Hovland's effort curled away and he went on to make bogey and finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left the outcome in the hands of Schauffele, who was on the par-four 17th where he did well to save par after his tee shot caught a fairway bunker before sealing the deal at the 18th while DeChambeau watched it unfold on a nearby screen. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tyrese Haliburton reacts during the Pacers' win against the Knicks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753838_1_20240520080620.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tyrese Haliburton scored 26 points for the visiting Indiana Pacers, who rode a historic shooting performance to a 130-109 win over the New York Knicks in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series Sunday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indiana shot 67.1 percent (53-of-79) from the field – the highest shooting percentage ever in an NBA playoff game. They broke the previous record held by the 1990 Boston Celtics, who shot 67 percent [63-of-94] in a 157-128 win over the Knicks in a first-round game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers, who overcame series deficits of 2-0 and 3-2, will face the Boston Celtics in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals, scheduled to begin Tuesday night. This is the first trip to the conference finals for Indiana since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks, who played short-handed throughout the series and lost star point guard Jalen Brunson to a fractured left hand in the third quarter Sunday, fell short in their bid to appear in the conference finals for the first time since 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Nembhard and Pascal Siakam each scored 20 points while Aaron Nesmith had 19 points on 8-of-8 shooting for the Pacers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner scored 17 points while T.J. McConnell added 12 points off the bench. The 130 points were the most by a road team in a Game 7 in NBA history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donte DiVincenzo scored 39 points for the Knicks, who played the series without All-Star Julius Randle [out since January with a right shoulder injury]. Mitchell Robinson didn't play after Game 1 due to an aggravation of his left ankle injury while OG Anunoby missed the previous four games with a left hamstring before scoring five points in fewer than five first-quarter minutes Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart played 36-plus minutes Sunday despite an abdominal injury he suffered in Game 6 Friday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alec Burks had 26 points Sunday while Brunson had 17 points and nine assists. Hart tallied 10 points, eight rebounds and five assists before fouling out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks scored the first seven points of the third quarter to begin a 12-3 run that pulled them within 73-67 with 8:06 left. But Indiana answered with a 22-9 run and led by at least 13 throughout the fourth quarter. (Reuters)

    Spain pulls ambassador over Milei speech row

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain recalled its ambassador to Buenos Aires for consultations on Sunday after Argentina's President Javier Milei made derogatory comments about Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's wife during a far-right rally in Madrid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Milei had called Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez "corrupt" during a rally in Madrid organised by the far-right Vox party and attended by many of its international allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said he expected an apology from Milei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other ministers also condemned Milei's speech, in which he described socialism as "cursed and carcinogenic". Sanchez leads Spain's Socialist Party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With his behaviour, Milei has brought the relationship between Spain and Argentina to its most serious state in recent history," Albares said in a video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milei's visit broke with diplomatic protocol as he refused to meet Spain's King Felipe and Sanchez, instead preferring to promote his book alongside Vox leader Santiago Abascal at the party rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on social messaging app X that "attacks against family members of political leaders have no place in our culture".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party (PP), refused to support Madrid's stance, with party sources saying that Sanchez should have provided explanations about the alleged corruption case weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A city court said in April it was looking into accusations of influence peddling and business corruption against Sanchez's wife, brought in a private complaint by Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, an anti-corruption activist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Madrid's prosecuting authority later said it was appealing to have the case thrown out for lack of evidence. Sanchez decided to stay in office after five days of weighing his future once the probe against his wife was announced. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City won an unprecedented fourth straight English top flight title with a 3-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday to pip rivals Arsenal on the final day of a thrilling Premier League season as the fans turned the pitch into a sea of blue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two glorious early goals from league player of the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from Mohammed Kudus before halftime brought West Ham briefly into the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Rodri sealed the victory with a low 59th minute shot from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a phenomenal sixth title in seven years. Fans danced in their seats, belting out: "Champions again!" and "Are you watching Arsenal?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the closest title races in Premier League history, Arsenal could have taken the championship had City dropped points. But the Londoners' 2-1 win in their game against Everton was in vain, leaving them two points behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have the chance of winning the double as they face Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden's already brilliant season got even better when he arrowed the ball into the top corner in the second minute then capped a fine team move to sweep home the second in the 18th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so hard to put into words what we've done today," Foden said. "No team has ever done it. You see what it means to the fans and it means to us. Working all year for this moment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought today we just looked confident and just played our football and in the end it paid off."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder has scored 19 league goals this season and has won six Premier League titles at just 23, making him one of England's best hopes for this year's Euros in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the final whistle, the home fans poured onto the pitch, some letting off blue flares in celebration, while the players hugged each other in joy. (Reuters)

    Bezos' Blue Origin launches first flight since 2022

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bezos' Blue Origin launches first flight since 2022" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753820_1_20240520001226.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin launched a six-person crew – including the first US Black astronaut candidate from the 1960s – from West Texas to the edge of space on Sunday, resuming its centerpiece space tourism business for the first time since its suborbital New Shepard rocket was grounded in 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am ecstatic," Ed Dwight, who at age 90 years and eight months became the oldest person in space, said upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight and the other passengers, seated in a gumdrop-shaped capsule atop the rocket, were launched from Blue Origin facilities near the remote desert town of Van Horn. The rocket separated from the capsule, which then ascended further beyond the boundary of Earth's atmosphere to 105.7km, while the booster returned to land as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule then returned to Earth under parachutes, capping a mission lasting roughly 10 minutes. One of the capsule's three parachutes did not fully inflate, a hitch that may draw scrutiny before the rocket's next flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight was the first Black astronaut candidate who was picked by former US President John Kennedy in 1961 to train as an astronaut, but until now had never flown to space. Dwight stepped out of the capsule once it landed and thrust his fists into the air in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I really didn't need this in my life, but now I need it in my life," Dwight told a Blue Origin interviewer upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin has now flown 37 private astronauts, including in 2021 "Star Trek" star William Shatner, who was 90 years and six months old at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passengers, also including a venture capitalist and a pilot, were paying customers of Blue Origin's space tourism business, though Dwight's seat was sponsored by a space-focused nonprofit and a private foundation. Blue Origin has not disclosed how much it charges customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The grounding of New Shepard, Blue Origin's only active rocket, came after a mid-flight failure in September 2022 during an uncrewed research mission. A structural failure in the rocket's engine nozzle, the company concluded, forced the capsule full of science experiments to abort. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen held off a late charge by McLaren's Lando Norris to win the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix by less than a second on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's triple Formula One world champion took the chequered flag just 0.725 of a second ahead of the man who beat him at the previous round in Miami and sensed he might snatch another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Verstappen's fifth in seven races this season, the 59th of his career and the third edition in a row at Imola. Last year's race at the Italian circuit was cancelled due to heavy flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had no grip anymore. I was sliding a lot. I saw Lando closing in. The last 10 laps were flat out," said a relieved Verstappen, who had appeared set for another easy win but had to sweat ultimately for the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's difficult when the tyres were not working anymore and you have to go flat out. I couldn't afford to make too many mistakes. Luckily we didn't."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was third at the Italian team's atmospheric home track, 7.916 off the pace, for his fourth podium finish of the season and a home race to come in Monaco next weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory extended Verstappen's championship lead to 48 points, with Leclerc now his closest rival after Red Bull's Sergio Perez started 11th and finished only eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has 161 points, Leclerc 113 and Perez 107. Red Bull have 268 in the constructors' standings with Ferrari on 212 and McLaren on 154.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished fourth, after starting fifth due to a three-place grid penalty for impeding in qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fifth and the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell sixth and seventh on another afternoon to forget for the once-dominant team. (Reuters)

    Iran leader's helicopter crashes; fog hampers rescue

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ebrahim Raisi was reported to be onboard the helicopter that came down. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753814_1_20240519220926.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were struggling to reach the site of the incident.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were "at risk following the helicopter crash", which happened on the way back from a visit to the border with Azerbaijan in Iran's northwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State TV quoted an official as saying that at least one passenger and one crew member had been in contact with rescuers. It also said the helicopter had been found, though Iran's Red Crescent denied this report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian state media said bad weather was the cause of the crash and was complicating rescue efforts. The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all the resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guard to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is dark and it has started raining, but the search continues. Rescue teams have reached the area ... however, the rain has created mud, making the search difficult," a local reporter told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national broadcaster had earlier stopped all its regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country and, in a corner of the screen, live coverage of rescue teams deployed on foot in the mountainous area in heavy fog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rescue teams were expected to reach the probable site of the crash later on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neighbouring countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology to help Iran with the search.

    'Smaller Olympic presence will still be a success'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tony Choi, who heads the Hong Kong Sports Institute, says he hopes Hong Kong can win medals in every Olympic Games from now on. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753787_1_20240519161207.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they have arrested two people on suspicion of vandalising a tombstone in Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to video circulating online, it belonged to Wong Ka-kui, the late singer of the now-disbanded musical band, Beyond.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video purportedly showed someone smashing the tombstone with a hammer, as well as spraying liquid and writing with a black marker on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the pair arrested are aged 15 and 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on social media, a former member of Beyond, Yip Sai-wing, called the incident "truly outrageous" and said anyone found guilty of carrying out the act must be punished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong died in 1993 at the age of 31.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Qijiguang bore a banner reading "Bring peace and friendship to meet good friends" as it approached the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint training is the naval component of the ongoing Golden Dragon exercises, which are regularly held between the two countries. (AP & AFP)

    'Xia values Macau as an international metropolis'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong highly values Macau's position as an international metropolis and its cooperation with nearby Hengqin, Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said on Sunday as the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office wrapped up his week-long inspection trip to the gambling hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During his visit, Xia met representatives from various sectors, including healthcare, education and technology, to learn more about the latest social and economic developments in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said the senior Beijing official described Macau as "the apple of the motherland's eye" and stressed the need to use its advantages to build a "golden business card".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From my understanding, Director Xia's visit this time is to make an assessment of the current term of the SAR government. It's a great support for our work. They provide suggestions on areas where our work is insufficient," the Macau leader told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regarding our existing problems, they convey what the central government expects from us in meetings with executive, legislative and judicial bodies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Xia's second visit to Macau in as many years and came ahead of the 25th anniversary of the SAR's handover and a new term of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said Xia didn't mention the Macau CE election during the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, he emphasised a lot the 'golden business card' of Macau, and he also emphasised that Macau is now an international city, or an international cosmopolitan," Agnes Lam, associate professor at the University of Macau and a former lawmaker, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he didn't mention 'international' that many times last time. I think this is a new emphasis for Macau."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip, Xia visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and inspected a number of projects there, and Lam believes it shows the central government wants quicker integration of Macau and Hengqin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they urge the progress to be faster. This time, I think Director Xia also visited several key projects, including a residential project named Macau [New] Neighbourhood. And also he asked the whole society to support the government to speed up that project. So I think he also sent a stronger message about we should progress with that project."

    Turn Kai Tak Covid facility into arts &amp; sport hub: DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Sunday called on the government to transform the disused Covid isolation facility in Kai Tak into a base for the arts and sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, lawmaker Starry Lee said the facility, spanning around 80,000 square metres, has remained unused for a long time while incurring a monthly maintenance cost of HK$400,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now, we believe it is a good time to sort of restructure and reshape (it) as an international exchange art, sport hub, because this can leverage on the existing facility including the opening of the sport centre in Kai Tak area and also we have the cruise terminal," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are expecting more tourists to come through the cruise terminal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who represents the Kowloon Central geographical constituency, suggested the government develop a water sports centre, a dedicated space for youth art creation, as well as an exhibition area to showcase Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage within the Kai Tak complexes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said the transportation facilities in the Kai Tak area are inadequate, and called on the government to expedite the development of an eco-transportation system there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn told the Legislative Council that the government was considering turning the Covid-19 isolation facility in Kai Tak into a hub for the cultural and creative industries.

    Police seize HK$204m worth of cocaine among scrap iron

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they have seized about 225 kilograms of suspected cocaine at a warehouse in Ta Kwu Ling and arrested two men.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said the haul had a market value of HK$204 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspected drugs were hidden among containers said to be carrying scrap iron and shipped from the South American country of Suriname.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers raided the warehouse in Ping Che on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our investigation reviewed that the drug-trafficking syndicate employed some, we believe, unwitting truck workers to assist them to dismantle approximately those 40 tonnes of scrap iron from the containers, with the syndicate overseeing the unloading,” superintendent Wilson Tam said in a press briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Subsequently, our officers conducted the raid, and we found two workers and arrested the other two suspected members of the drug syndicate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, aged 22 and 29, were held on suspicion of trafficking in dangerous drugs and will appear before Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam added that intelligence indicated the suspected drugs were being stored in Hong Kong before they were to be sold in other countries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Peaceful dialogue is the only way to address the concerns of students protesting around the world in solidarity with the people of Gaza amid the war between Israel and Hamas, a US economist and Columbia University scholar said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jeffrey Sachs made the remarks after pro-Palestinian protests that first began at Columbia University in New York City spread across some 140 campuses in the US, and subsequently reached Europe, Australia and India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been calls to stop the war and for universities to divest and cut ties with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are protests against an ongoing brutal war that Israel is waging in Gaza. And I think the protests in one form or another are going to continue and perhaps intensify if this war continues this way. So students are just seeing injustice and cruelty, and they are responding to it," Sachs told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while different schools have handled the protests in different ways, the use of violence to clamp down on demonstrators will only make matters worse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some universities responded very calmly, discussed with the students, the students appreciated the discussions, and the crisis was averted," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In other cases, the universities called in the police right away. And this escalated the tensions, and I think did unnecessary damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scholar highlighted the importance for school administrators to listen to the students and set up designated areas for demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Students want respect. They're open for discussion. Administrators are right to keep the universities properly functioning, but that leaves a lot of room for peaceful discussion, deliberation and agreements," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.

    Usyk takes undisputed title for first time in 25 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Oleksandr Usyk celebrates his points victory over Tyson Fury. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753745_1_20240519083939.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk beat Tyson Fury by split decision to win the world's first undisputed heavyweight championship on Sunday, an unprecedented feat in boxing's four-belt era.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Britain's Fury was the early aggressor but Usyk gradually took charge and the "Gypsy King" was saved by the bell in the ninth round before slumping to his first career defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Usyk joins the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight champion, the first since boxing recognised four major belts in the 2000s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the win, the still-undefeated former undisputed cruiserweight champion can legitimately claim to be the best of this era, although a rematch expected in October could provide another twist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a big opportunity for me, for my family, for my country," said Usyk, 37, who briefly served as a soldier after Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a great time, a great day," he said, adding that he was "ready for a rematch".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fury called it a "fantastic fight with Oleksandr".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I won that fight, I believe he won a few of the rounds, but I won the majority of them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know his country is at war, so people are siding with the country at war but make no mistake, I won that fight in my opinion and I will be back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Lennox Lewis was the last man to unify the heavyweight belts -- three at the time -- after beating Evander Holyfield in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two judges scored it for Usyk by scores of 115-112 and 114-113 while the third gave it to Fury 114-113. The victory extended Usyk's professional record to 22-0. After his first loss, Fury stands at 34-1-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk, who adds Fury's WBC belt to his IBF, WBA and WBO titles, looks set to go down as one of the greats after dominating at amateur, cruiserweight and now the top division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fired-up Fury came running out of his corner to start the fight and the 2.06 metre boxer was quickly into his rhythm, keeping the shorter Usyk back with his jab and playing to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk got inside with some quick combinations while Fury landed some heavy body shots. By round four, the Mancunian was taunting his ever-advancing opponent and showboating, guard down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk called two low shots in round five and got caught with a left hook as Fury continued to look comfortable, landing a telling uppercut in the following round and bobbing and weaving to stay out of range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Ukrainian tagged Fury with two clean lefts in the seventh and landed a punishing hook that dazed the "Gypsy King" in the eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the next round, a relentless Usyk barrage had Fury in serious trouble and the wobbling, bleeding Mancunian took a standing count before being saved by the bell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fury recovered his poise and with the match in the balance heading into the final round, both fighters were finding the target.
  <br/>

  Wladimir Klitschko was among the legends watching along with Saudi-based football stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, who like boxing are grateful beneficiaries of the oil-rich monarchy's lavish push into sports. (AFP)

    Lowry matches Schauffele's record PGA round

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shane Lowry played his way into contention at Valhalla. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753741_1_20240519053336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry matched the lowest round in major golf history on Saturday, shooting a nine-under par 62 in the third round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Irishman tied the mark achieved four prior times, most recently in Thursday's first round by Xander Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other 62s were made by Schauffele and fellow American Rickie Fowler in the first round at last year's US Open and the 2017 British Open by South African Branden Grace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bogey-free round left Lowry, the 2019 British Open winner, on 13-under par 200 for 54 holes, one stroke behind leader Schauffele, who was still on the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry birdied eight of the first 14 holes at Valhalla to reach 12-under and briefly share the lead, sinking birdie putts of 37 feet at 13 and 32 feet at the par-3 14th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He fired 29 on the front nine with birdies on six of the first nine holes, four of those between 13 and 19 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Lowry sank a birdie putt from just beyond six feet at the par-4 17th, there was a buzz around the course as he walked to the par-5 finishing hole, one softened and more receptive after rain earlier this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 18, Lowry's tee shot found the left rough and his second shot landed in the left rough, but his third drew wild applause, setting him up for a birdie putt from just inside 12 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry's bid to make the first 61 in major championship history missed but he tapped in for 62 and a share of history. (AFP)

 Firefighters were called to a chemical leak in Yuen Long in the early hours of Sunday, with people in the area urged to close their windows.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The incident involved oil tanks on Wang Lok Street, and Fire Services Department officers were called in just before 1am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Members of the public who are being affected by the smoke and an unusual odour carried by the wind are advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm," a government statement said.

    I'll quit without Gaza plan: Israeli minister Gantz

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753733_1_20240519024945.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz demanded on Saturday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commit to an agreed vision for the Gaza conflict that would include stipulating who might rule the territory after the war with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gantz told a press conference he wanted the war cabinet to form a six-point plan by June 8. If his expectations are not met, he said, he will withdraw his centrist party from the conservative premier's broadened emergency coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz, a retired top Israeli general who opinion polls show is Netanyahu's most formidable political rival, gave no date for the prospective walkout but his challenge could increase strains on an increasingly unwieldy wartime government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu appears outflanked in his own inner war cabinet, where he, Gantz and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant alone have votes. On Wednesday, Gallant demanded clarity on post-war plans and for Netanyahu to forswear any military reoccupation of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the prime minister were to do that, he would risk angering ultra-nationalist coalition parties that have called for Gaza to be annexed and settled. Losing them could topple Netanyahu, who before the war failed to enlist more centrist partners, given his trial on corruption charges he denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personal and political considerations have begun to penetrate the Holy of Holies of Israel's national security," Gantz said. "A small minority has seized the bridge of the Israeli ship and is piloting it toward the rocky shoal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz said his proposed six-point plan would include bringing a temporary US-European-Arab-Palestinian system of civil administration for Gaza while Israel retains security control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also institute equitable national service for all Israelis, including ultra-Orthodox Jews, who are now exempted from the military draft and have two parties in Netanyahu's coalition determined to preserve the waiver. (Reuters)

    Verstappen ties Senna record with Imola pole

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull's Max Verstappen equalled Ayrton Senna's record of eight pole positions in a row with the fastest lap in qualifying for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The late Brazilian's run was set in 1988/89 with McLaren and Verstappen, also a triple Formula One world champion, started his sequence in Abu Dhabi at the end of last season and has yet to be out-qualified in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's 39th career pole came as Formula One marks 30 years since Senna, who had 65 poles, died in a crash at the Italian circuit on May 1, 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a great start to the year and very special," said the Dutch driver after also matching Alain Prost's record 1993 seven successive poles at the start of a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's 30 years since he (Senna) passed away, so very pleased to get pole and in a way it's a nice memory to him. He was an incredible F1 driver, especially in qualifying," added Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri joined the championship leader provisionally on the front row, with stewards investigating the Australian for possibly impeding Haas's Kevin Magnussen in the first phase of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris, a first time winner at the previous race in Miami, qualified third for McLaren with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completing the second row at the Italian team's home circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are getting closer. To be ahead of Ferrari is also a nice result for us," said Norris. "It's going to be close, it's going to be a good race tomorrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully it's an exciting one. Tough, especially when the lap times are so tight. A lot of it is down to lap one, strategy and the pit stops." (Reuters)

    Coach De Zerbi to depart Brighton

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Roberto De Zerbi is on his way out of Brighton. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753724_1_20240518231611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton & Hove Albion coach Roberto De Zerbi will leave the club after their final match of the season against Manchester United, the Premier League club said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  De Zerbi joined Brighton in September 2022 when he replaced Graham Potter and made an instant impact when he secured their highest top-flight finish (sixth) and helped them qualify for European competition for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season, Brighton reached the last 16 of the Europa League but struggled in the Premier League where they are 10th going into the final day of the season on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Roberto has given us two excellent seasons of service in which he has led the club to new heights, not least our first ever European campaign which will live long in the memory of Albion fans," club chairman Tony Bloom said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have mutually agreed to end Roberto's contract at a time that suits both parties allowing us the earliest opportunity to plan for next season, and Roberto plenty of time to consider his next move and his future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian manager earned plaudits for an entertaining brand of football based on possession while he also nurtured young talents who were able to thrive in his system even as the club lost major players to bigger teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very sad to be leaving Brighton, but I am very proud of what my players and staff have achieved with the support of everyone at the club and our amazing fans in the past two historical seasons," De Zerbi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have really enjoyed an intense and challenging two years working in the Premier League, not least competing in four major competitions this season. Leaving now provides me with time to take a break before deciding on my future plans." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has announced that she has vetoed a draft law on foreign agents, Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zourabichvili had said previously that she would veto the bill, which has sparked street protests, but her decision can be overridden by another vote in parliament, controlled by Georgia's ruling party and its allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I vetoed a Russian law. This law is Russian in its essence and spirit," Tass quoted her as telling a briefing. "It contradicts our constitution and all European standards, therefore it represents an obstacle to our European path."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tass quoted the president as saying her veto was legally competent, and that it would be handed over to parliament on Saturday. "This law must be repealed," it quoted her as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, is, however, widely expected to overturn the veto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mass protests have swept through the Georgian capital Tbilisi over the past month since the first reading of the draft law was passed in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, imposing disclosure requirements and fines for violations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opponents see the bill as a test of whether the country stays on a path towards integration with Europe or pivots back towards Russia. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Jockey Club on Saturday announced that it's boosting the prize fund for special Snowball draws in its Mark Six lottery, making the big-money jackpots more frequent and larger.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club said it would start the new arrangements from Tuesday's draw, with more money being held back for the Snowball. It says the number of Snowball draws will rise from about seven per year to 12, while the top prize will be up to HK$100 million for some draws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club said in a statement: "The Snowball draw is a major attraction of the Mark Six."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club said the minimum prize for regular draws would remain unchanged at HK$8 million, while other variable and fized prize allocations would also stay the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the majority of lottery revenue after payouts goes on benefitting the Hong Kong community, with 40 percent of lottery turnover going on taxes or into the lotteries fund.

    Truck driver arrested over light rail incident

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested a truck driver on suspicion of causing a light rail carriage to derail, and disrupting light rail services in the western New Territories for about three hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is suspected that a plank, measuring 50 centimetres by 20 centimetres, fell from the truck the man was driving onto the light rail tracks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers arrested the 49-year-old man for alleged dangerous driving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident occurred at around 9:40am, when a carriage derailed near Chung Uk Tsuen Station and affected light rail routes 610, 614, 615, and 715.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, services were suspended at Lam Tei, Nai Wai, Chung Uk Tsuen and Hung Shui Kiu stations. But there were no injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR Corporation said it's investigating the incident, adding a preliminary investigation found that the train involved was not speeding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing sources, lawmaker Gary Zhang, the deputy chairman of the subcommittee on matters relating to railways at the Legislative Council, said the incident happened at a busy crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Although the incident is unrelated to the operations and maintenance of the light rail services, I think the MTR Corporation can still use technology to prevent similar incidents from happening again. For example, they can consider installing AI cameras at its junctions, or maybe install some vehicle-based detection systems so that early detections can be done,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang doesn't expect the incident to trigger any penalty mechanisms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the city’s transport chief Lam Sai-hung said that he had expressed concern about the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has conducted an immediate investigation at the scene of the incident and will study improvement measures along with the MTR Corporation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday said there are more companies than ever in Hong Kong, which shows that the city is a vibrant, reliable and convenient place to do business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said there are over 1.43 million local companies and around 15,000 non-local firms as of April - both record high figures for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said new companies were emerging, outnumbering those that folded by about 4,600 last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, it said the number of bankruptcy and winding up petitions fell in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities received 742 bankruptcy and 66 winding up petitions last month. The figures were slightly lower than those in March, but still at least 30 percent up from a year ago.

    'Double peak flu seasons' by two virus strains: doctor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An infectious disease expert on Saturday warned that Hong Kong could be hit by a double whammy in which its peak influenza seasons are dominated by two flu virus strains - one after another this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ivan Hung, who's also a professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that influenza virus infections have rebounded to a relatively high level recently, as residents have low immunity to influenza after three years of the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the peak flu season dominated by the A subtype H3 virus strain ended last October, infections have continued this year and the SAR also has to contend with a peak season dominated by the A subtype H1 flu virus strain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In January we have already had the influenza peak season for the subtype H3 virus, and then starting in April and May, we had the peak season that's dominated by the subtype H1 virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While the H1 virus-led inflections might ease from June and July, there's a chance that we might see the H3 virus making a comeback to form another small peak season from August and September,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think overall, the H3 virus-dominated peak season might be less serious compared with the one seen last year,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The infectious disease expert again called on parents to take their children to get a flu vaccine shot prior to the summer vacation, as there were many serious cases of children infected by the subtype H1 virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the city’s Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases had recommended that the Department of Health increase the procurement of the nasal vaccine to raise vaccination rates, as young children were more willing to receive the nasal vaccine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Hung predicted that the new Covid variant - KP.2 strain - that was discovered in the city’s sewage system, will replace the current prevalent variant - JN.1 - as the dominant Covid strain. But he said the new variant will not cause severe cases.

    Cash-strapped arts hub warns of opening restrictions

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The cash-strapped West Kowloon Cultural District on Saturday said the M+ and palace museums may have to restrict the days on which they open unless the government replies promptly to its financial proposals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, who chairs the cultural district authority's board, told i-Cable News that they have already handed in plans as to what to do when the authority's funds are drained next year, but the administration has not responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the government should have also completed a study into the authority's finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the arts hub will run out of money in June 2025, and that it's now taking loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the government delays [giving us a reply], we'll need to take big steps to cut costs. For example, the museums might just open four days a week, instead of six. The Xiqu centre may also open on fewer days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But will this be fair to the public? After all, this is not a commercial undertaking but a key public policy project."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added that restricting the days the facilities open will also go against the national policy to establish Hong Kong as a hub for cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had earlier told local newspapers that they did not wish to request more public money, but could shore up the cultural quarter's finances by selling part of its 40 hectares of land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a decision on their funding proposal will have to be made by June to enable contracts to be signed for new exhibitions and projects.

    'Govt poverty alleviation strategy not precise'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, says while government projects to tackle poverty have good feedback, they only support a limited number of people. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753673_2_20240518115702.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Social welfare lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen on Saturday criticised the government’s latest strategy to ease poverty by saying that such strategies are not “precise” or “accurate” in alleviating poverty as they did not include other groups that also require social support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came after authorities earlier identified around 950,000 elderly people, single parent households, and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tik said the latest strategy could not comprehensively reflect the city’s poverty situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not against having these target groups, but I think there aren't enough targeted groups, because there are also the disabled, the chronically ill, the mentally ill, and so on. So I think it's not 'broad' enough in terms of identifying the families who need key assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Secondly, the targeted groups are also not 'precise' enough, as it's very general to say that there are over 900,000 people [in these groups], but what about different levels… within them?” he commented, adding that the strategy is not “accurate”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislator also believes that the government must maintain and improve the so-called “poverty line”, instead of “abandoning” the gauge, as it could reflect whether those targeted measures to tackle poverty are having an effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The poverty line uses Hong Kong median household income as the sole gauge to measure poverty. The government earlier said such a gauge is no longer appropriate, and it will come up with a more accurate way of monitoring poverty levels later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The latest strategy is target group-based, and the poverty line is income-based, these two have different calculation methods and are not comparable,” Tik noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, which represents some 480 non-governmental social services organisations, said some government-led projects to tackle poverty aren't effective enough in offering help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He cited the “Strive and Rise Programme” the government set up as an example and said that such a project, despite having positive feedback in recent times, is only supporting a limited number of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There were about 2,000 pupils covered in the previous cohort under the programme, and about 4,000 covered in the current cohort. All these numbers are far [smaller] compared with poverty figures showing tens of thousands," Chua told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme cited was aimed at addressing inter-generational poverty issues by pairing under-privileged students with volunteer mentors - along with financial support:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government might need to explain to the public why the number of assisted pupils is so small?” he asked.

    Taxi industry has got to change: transport minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said future taxi fleets will have to allow digital payments, install video recording technology, and should respond to complaints.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam told a Commercial Radio programme that he hopes this government initiative to step up taxi management will enhance service standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the fleet management will... shift the culture of the whole taxi industry, because we have got to change. If we go on like this, the taxi industry will just get worse and people will have less and less confidence in it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said applications for taxi fleet licences are closing at the end of the month, and the licences will be issued in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fleets should start operating within a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said the upcoming taxi fare hike is needed so the industry can stay financially sustainable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said taxi drivers earned HK$17,000 to HK$20,000 a month on average last year, and some of them had seen their income fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After taking into account inflation, some taxi drivers - for example those working on Lantau - earned a lower income than they did in 2019. We think this isn't good for the taxi sector's long term development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cost of gas and insurance have also gone up. We considered these factors before reaching the decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said they had also considered if people would accept a fare hike, before announcing that flagfall for all taxis will rise by HK$2 from July 14.

    SAR's health sector needs to be 'innovation driver'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau (left) is upbeat on the prospects for the SAR's health and dental sector - as long as it continues to innovate.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau said on Saturday that he's confident that Hong Kong's high quality healthcare and dental services will remain competitive, even though some local patients have been heading north for services on the mainland that are cheaper.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said while some patients think the mainland offers better value-for-money services, the SAR has nothing to worry about so long as the profession keeps improving its services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lo said on RTHK's Your Home Address programme that as the government seeks to develop the SAR as an international health and medical innovation hub, Hong Kong can also drive advancement in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has excellent health care service and we have a wonderful university here with a medical school and a dental school. We're not just good in providing service, we should be good in innovation as well," the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we are good, we have all the talents, enough talents, we should actually not be looking just at providing services. We should be driving, we should be the driver for innovation."
