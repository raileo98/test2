<div class="itemFullText">
 China shaded Japan in men's artistic gymnastics qualifying at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with all-around leader Zhang Boheng hailing his team's spirit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a frenetic first day's action at Bercy Arena, a boisterous crowd was treated to a taste of the thrills and spills ahead, with American superstar Simone Biles making her eagerly awaited entrance on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian Olympic Committee won the men's team title at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games but Russian gymnasts are not defending their title, leaving China as favourites to take gold for the first time since London 2012 on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by Olympic debutant Zhang, China topped the team qualifying standings by 2.434 points from Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain, featuring world vault champion Jake Jarman and double Olympic pommel horse gold medallist Max Whitlock, were third ahead of Ukraine and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang topped the individual all-around table from Japan's Shinnosuke Oka and defending champion Daiki Hashimoto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy with that, it's my highest score in a major competition this year" said Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our team performed excellently. Everyone did very well and showed great team spirit." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Day one of the sporting action at the Paris Olympics is in the record books. Here's how it unfolded for the Hong Kong, China athletes, national team competitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia's success in swimming sees them lead the embyonic medal table with three golds ahead of China with two. Team Hong Kong China rank joint ninth with sporting superpower Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here are the top stories:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A golden comeback for fencing queen Vivian Kong
  <br/>
  <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1763445_5_L_20240728043934.jpg">

   </div>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong, who had been 7-1 down in the second period, struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Golden glory for China's shooters, divers
   <br/>
   <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1763445_1_L_20240727223107.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Team China made a perfect start to the Games, sealing the first gold medal in the 10-metre air rifle mixed team event. Seventeen-year-old Huang Yuting and 19-year-old Sheng Lihao clinched their victory over South Koreans Keum Jihyeon and Park Hajun, outscoring their opponents 16-12.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not long afterwards, divers Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen won the women's synchronised three-metre springboard event, kicking off China's bid to take home all eight diving gold medals at the Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Doo and Wong advance in mixed doubles
    <br/>

     <br/>
     Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting advanced to the last eight in the mixed doubles event, defeating their Hungarian opponents 4-1 in their opening match.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The mixed doubles quarter-finals will be on Sunday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Heartbreak for judoka Wong Ka-lee
     <br/>

       <span>
       </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Hong Kong judoka Wong Ka-lee bowed out from the Olympics, losing 10-0 to Austrian Katharina Tanzer. Wong was eliminated in the women’s 48-kilogramme competition by Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Meanwhile in the swimming pool, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Repecharge chance for rower Chiu Hin-chun
      <br/>
      <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1763445_3_L_20240727225339.jpg">

        <span>
        </span>
       </div>
       <br/>
       Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun narrowly missed out on qualifying for the next round at the Paris Olympics, but moves on to the repechage for another chance. He finished fourth out of five in his heat and will go into Sunday's repecharge with the fastest time of any competitor.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia began their Olympic swim campaign with two golds while the United States stamped their authority in the men's 4x100 metres freestyle relay to win in a time of 3 minutes, 9.28 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia took silver and Italy won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's relay capped an exciting night of Olympic swimming at La Defense Arena, which began when Germany's Lukas Maertens surged to victory in the men's 400 metres freestyle gold medal, narrowly missing the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old was under world record pace for 350 metres before fading in the final stretch to touch in 3 minutes, 41.78 seconds ahead of Australia's Elijah Winnington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korean 2024 world champion Kim Woo-min took bronze in 3 minutes, 42.50 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maertens was overcome with emotion after his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Means everything to me -- you can see my progress in performance... I am extremely happy and just overwhelmed," said Maertens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't put into words what I am feeling now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 400 metres freestyle final wasn't as fast as expected but it saw defending champion and world record holder Ariarne Titmus stamp her dominance from the get go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian led from start to finish to win in 3 minutes 57.49 seconds, holding off the challenge from Canada's Summer McIntosh who took silver while US star Katie Ledecky grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just happy to get the result for myself and I feel so honoured to be a part of the race and be alongside legends like Katie," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look up to her so much as an athlete and there's certainly not a rivalry beyond the races. I really respect her as a person and I hope that I put on a good show tonight and everyone enjoyed it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia also claimed their fourth consecutive gold in the women's 400 freestyle relay in an Olympic record time of 3 minutes, 28.92 seconds as the Dolphins out fought their American rivals who took silver in an Americas record time while China won bronze with a new Asian mark. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Engineers from national rail operator SNCF repair cables damaged in the attacks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763483_1_20240728042748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's national rail operator on Saturday said train travel was gradually returning to normal after multiple sabotage acts paralysed the network hours ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It remains unclear who carried out the three attacks overnight Thursday to Friday on rail infrastructure and if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Olympics opening ceremony that took place later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a message of support for the sabotage was sent to several media outlets on Saturday, which also criticised the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through a second day of cancelled and delayed trains on Saturday with 160,000 of the 800,000 people due to travel on a major holiday getaway weekend still facing cancellations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said national rail operator SNCF had mobilised a hundred workers overnight to repair the damage "in difficult weather conditions" and ensure a return to normal for Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the night, "with floodlights, in the rain, they patched up the wires one by one," said SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything will be repaired by Monday morning" on the SNCF network, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fibre optic cables running near the tracks and ensuring the transmission of safety information for drivers, such as signalling lights and points, were cut and set on fire during the night from Thursday to Friday on three of the main TGV lines, in the west, north and east of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No claim of responsibility has been made for the meticulously planned night-time attacks. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a statement sent to several news media expressed support for the sabotage and criticised the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They call it a festival? We see it as a celebration of nationalism, a gigantic stating of the subjugation of populations by states," said the email received by the newspaper La Provence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the headline of the message said, "claim to sabotage," no details of the action were provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was signed by "an unexpected delegation" and was sent via the online platform Riseup, whose users include those advocating for social change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris prosecutors on Friday opened a probe into an attack on "fundamental national interests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observers have noted that the nature of the attacks indicate the culprits would have needed deep knowledge of the functioning of the railways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the investigation was progressing, as he also expressed "relief" that the opening ceremony had taken place without any mishap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Darmanin told France 2 television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was "too early" to say who was behind the attack. "It could have come from inside (France) or from the outside."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities are on high alert for a terrorist attack during the Games, which run through August 11. Tens of thousands of police and troops are on security duties during the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250,000 people missed their train on Friday, according to SNCF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three out of every 10 trains were cancelled on Saturday in the three regions affected by the attacks, with most trains still operating delayed by between one and two hours, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one third of trains were cancelled in northern, western and eastern France. About a quarter of Eurostar high speed trains between Paris and London and Paris and Brussels were also called off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With normal services set to be fully restored on Monday, the situation is already expected to improve markedly on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine out of 10 TGV high speed trains will be able to run on the western and southwestern lines on Sunday, while service will be more patchy in the north, where seven out of 10 trains are due to run, SNCF said. Trains to eastern France have not been affected. (AFP)

 Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong on Sunday won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Frenchwoman, ranked sixth in the world, started off strong, taking a 7-1 lead in the second round after taking the first 4-0, to the delight of the home crowd, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at the Grand Palais.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With momentum fully on Mallo-Breton's side, world number one Kong changed sword in an apparent attempt to regroup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China athlete then fenced on a 9-3 run to tie the score at 10-10 in the middle of the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what went through her mind when she clawed back from the big deficit, Kong said she didn't want to "lose ugly" and not be able to fence with "the Hong Kong spirit".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also thanked people in Hong Kong for showing support. "Thank you for staying up and watching, and I know, I'm so grateful," Kong told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really thankful, I'm really grateful, I'm just so lucky because every [fencer] deserves it, in fencing anything can happen, I love all the girls here, I just can't believe it's me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tearful Kong also said that in the past, she was afraid of losing and got more nervous. But she now believed that, as she's worked to the best of her abilities and everyone around her has done their best to support her, she no longer had to sweat herself out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong fencer's coach for the past nine years, Octavian Zidaru, said he thinks Kong has made amazing progress and overcame lots of injuries to reach the top of the Olympic podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Kong now has many moves and tactics at her disposal, and in the past month he's tried to just calm her nerves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last month, I tried not to put any pressure on her, even in Hong Kong," Zidaru told reporters. "I told her, 'we participate in this Olympic Games like in any other competition.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's only the third Hong Kong gold in history and follows fellow fencer Edgar Cheung's foil victory in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee sent his congratulations, while the sports minister, Kevin Yeung, said after watching the final in Paris that he was "touched and delighted by her performance and demeanour of a great athlete".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as Macron, spectators who saw Kong's triumph included US First Lady Jill Biden and Rolling Stone's Mick Jagger.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France won an historic first gold medal in men's Olympic Rugby Sevens, beating two-time defending champions and rugby sevens' powerhouses Fiji 28-7 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was also the first gold medal of the Games for the host nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tied at 7-7 going into the break, the French dominated the Fijians much to the delight of the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Dupont scored two tries and set up another to inspire France to the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result is a remarkable comeback for the French who failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Africa beat Australia 26-19 in a closely-fought bronze-medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Aussies took a 7-5 lead at the break, but the Springbok Sevens took control of the match in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two quick tries by Zain Davids, both converted by Tristan Leyds, coupled with a red card to Australia's Nick Malouf for a dangerous tackle on Tiaan Pretorius, put South Africa in control at 19-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Aussies scored two late tries, one of which was converted, to pull level on the scoreboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the last restart, with seconds left on the clock, the Springboks created space on the left with Selvyn Davids racing away before giving the ball to Shaun Williams to score the match - and medal - winner. (Agencies)

 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix on pole position with Red Bull's Sergio Perez next to him on the front row.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World champion Max Verstappen was 0.595 seconds quicker than Leclerc in a wet qualifying session on Saturday but the Red Bull driver starts in 11th place because of a 10-place grid penalty for taking a new engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I definitely did not expect that this weekend but with the tricky conditions we could do something above our expectations," said Leclerc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a good day for the team and now we need to focus on tomorrow and see what will happen when the rain is gone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's teammate Perez, who was just 0.011sec behind Leclerc, will join the Monegasque on the front row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton starts from third in his Mercedes, followed by the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who locked out an impressive 1-2 in the last race in Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mercedes' George Russell was seventh fastest ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and the Alpine of Esteban Ocon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong will be the first Hong Kong, China medallist of the 2024 Paris Olympics after a dramatic semi-final victory in the women's epee in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one defeated Estonia's Nelli Differt 15-11 in a nail-biting semi-final that saw the lead change hands frequently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first period started with a tight back and forth tussle that resulted in a two-all tie. That intensity continued into the second period, as the two players went neck to neck but Kong was able to move herself up on the scoreboard 8-7 by the end of that spell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong successfully widened the gap in the final round, adding seven points to pull herself into the gold medal bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencing queen is the second person from the SAR to win a fencing medal after Tokyo champion Edgar Cheung, and the first in the epee discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold or silver will be Hong Kong first ever medal in women's fencing. She'll face local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in the final at 3.30am, Hong Kong time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women’s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each on Saturday in a drone spying scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The stunning swath of punishments include a US$226,000 fine for the Canadian soccer federation in a case that has spiraled at the Summer Games. Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national soccer federation then removed from the Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priestman and her two assistants implicated in the case, Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander, are now banned from all soccer for one year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behavior and violation of the principles of fair play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coaches and the Canadian federation now can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport's special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 11 people were killed in a rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, Israeli Channel 13 reported, amid an escalation of fire between Israel and armed groups in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli emergency service said earlier that 11 people were critically wounded by a rocket fired from Lebanon that hit a village football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams. A medic described great destruction and fire at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However senior Hezbollah media representative Mohammad Afif denied responsibility for the strike on Majdal Shams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire since October, after Hamas' attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, in their worst escalation since 2006. (Reuters)

 Real Madrid unveiled Brazilian teenager Endrick, who has joined the European champions on a six-year deal, in an event at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Endrick, who turned 18 last week, arrives from the Brazilian club Palmeiras, where he won two league titles and a Super Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his international debut aged 17 against Colombia last November, going on to score his first goal against England in a 1-0 win in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was a member of Brazil's Copa America squad, making his first international start in the quarter-final with Uruguay which they lost on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't have words to describe what I'm feeling because I've always wanted to be here," Endrick said during his presentation at the Bernabeu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wanted to play for Madrid, it's like a dream coming true today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid begin the defence of their La Liga title when they face Mallorca on August 18. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting advanced to the last eight in the mixed doubles event, defeating their Hungarian opponents 4-1 in their opening match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo jumped out to a 2-0 lead, before Dora Madarasz and Nandor Ecseki clawed a game back 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hungarians lost the fourth game 11-6 as the SAR duo stormed their way to take the final game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our belief never wavered. We hope we can play every point well. And in the end, we managed to do that," Wong told reporters in the post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair will face Maria Xiao and Alvaro Robles from Spain in the quarter-finals on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong gymnast Stone Shek was unable to make it to the final round in vault, finishing 12th in the qualifying round with eight athletes making the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He miscued his first jump after landing on his feet and needed to use his hands to regain his balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shek, who was making his third Olympic appearance after London and Tokyo, ended up with a score of 14.099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite not advancing further, the gymnast, 32, said Paris was a very good experience which he found to be the most enjoyable and pressure free in his 20 odd years in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because vault after all is a little bit like gambling. No matter how good you do during practice, when you can't make the move during the competition, you can't," Shek told reporters.

    Japan's Sado mines added to World Heritage list

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People celebrate after the Sado Island Gold Mine was registered as a World Heritage Site. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763465_1_20240728004100.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register on Saturday after South Korea dropped earlier objections to its listing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sado gold and silver mines, now a popular tourist attraction, are believed to have started operating as early as the 12th century and produced until after World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had put a case for World Heritage listing because of their lengthy history and the artisanal mining techniques used there at a time when European mines had turned to mechanisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal was opposed by Seoul when it was first put because of the use of involuntary Korean labour during World War II, when Japan occupied the Korean peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But South Korea's foreign ministry said it had agreed to the listing "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unesco confirmed the listing at its ongoing committee meeting in New Delhi after a bid highlighting the archaeological preservation of "mining activities and social and labour organisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The inscription was the result of a 14-year effort," Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to share this joy with local people as well as all Japanese citizens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had reiterated a pledge to keeping the memories alive of "the harsh labour conditions of all workers," the foreign ministry in Tokyo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that exhibits on Sado island included data showing a higher percentage of Korean labourers were engaged in dangerous underground tasks, while others fled or were detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historians have argued that recruitment conditions at the mine effectively amounted to forced labour, and that Korean workers faced significantly harsher conditions than their Japanese counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discrimination did exist," Toyomi Asano, a professor of history of Japanese politics at Tokyo's Waseda University, said in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their working conditions were very bad and dangerous. The most dangerous jobs were allocated to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sado mines were listed alongside the Beijing Central Axis, a collection of former imperial palaces and gardens in the Chinese capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 589-hectare heritage area reflects "the ancient Chinese tradition of urban planning, serving as an important emblem that highlights the distinctive characteristics of Chinese civilisation," state news agency Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other listings this week include the centuries-old, ornate burial mounds of the Ahom Dynasty in northeastern India and the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saint Hilarion complex, one of the oldest monasteries in the Middle East dating back to the fourth century, was meanwhile added to a list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Unesco committee meeting runs until Wednesday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said an Israeli strike on Saturday on a school killed 30 people, after a days-long military operation further south left around 170 dead, according to the civil defence agency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Since July 6 at least eight schools – including the latest one – have been hit leaving more than 100 people dead, based on a tally of tolls given by the health ministry and a hospital source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced at least once during the war started by the October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings including the one hit on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest strike in the Deir el-Balah city area targeted Khadija school, the health ministry said. More than 100 people were wounded, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it carried out a strike on the school targeting "terrorists" operating there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in the Khan Younis city area, around 170 people have been killed "and hundreds wounded" during an Israeli operation over several days there, Gaza's Civil Defence Agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It issued the toll after the military earlier on Saturday warned of new operations in the area and issued fresh evacuation orders for residents of Khan Younis, where troops had earlier recovered the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian state-linked media said Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are to meet with Israeli negotiators in the Italian capital on Sunday in the latest push for a Gaza truce, which critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have accused him of blocking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said more than 180,000 Palestinians had already fled fierce fighting in Khan Younis since the military operation began almost a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation orders and "intensified hostilities" have "significantly destabilised aid operations," the UN said, reporting "dire water, hygiene and sanitation conditions" in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had warned last Monday that its forces would "forcefully operate" in the Khan Younis region – from where rockets had been fired – including an area previously declared a safe humanitarian zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan Younis was left devastated after heavy fighting early in the year but the military withdrew in April saying it had "concluded its mission" there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now it has returned in force. On Wednesday the military said troops carried out an operation in Khan Younis and retrieved the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had been killed during the October 7 attack on Israel and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said on Friday that its forces had "eliminated approximately 100" militants in Khan Younis during the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the captives' bodies were pulled from underground tunnels and walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack that began the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,258 people, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its latest toll on Saturday included 83 deaths over the previous 48 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, the military ordered residents from more parts of Khan Younis "to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi" – the second such adjustment made to the safe zone within a week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in Rafah, medics said on Saturday that four people were killed and several wounded in an air strike on a house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military on Saturday said troops had targeted "military infrastructure sites" in the Rafah area and "eliminated dozens" of militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Qahera news, which has links to Egyptian intelligence, reported on Friday that talks "to reach agreement on a truce in Gaza" would take place on Sunday in Rome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US news outlet Axios separately reported that CIA Director Bill Burns was expected to hold talks in Rome with Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mediation efforts have focused on a ceasefire and hostage-release accompanied by the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. US President Joe Biden presented the framework in late May, billing it as an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting on Thursday in Washington, Biden called on Netanyahu to "finalise" a deal and "reach a durable end to the war in Gaza," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That same day, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has regularly protested for a deal, alleged "deliberate sabotage" of talks and demanded an urgent meeting with Israeli negotiators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their accusation came after a source with knowledge of the talks said the arrival of Israeli negotiators in Qatar had been postponed from Thursday to this coming week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's world number one fencer, Vivian Kong, is another step closer to reaching the Olympic podium, after sweeping Ukraine's Olena Kryvytska in the quarter-finals of the women's individual epee on Saturday at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong started the first round with a strong 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian was able to come back with four points, but the SAR fencing star fought back hard to finish the second period 9-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong then eased her way into the final four with six additional points in the final round to win 15-7, making this bout her best performance so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competition now moves onto the podium piste for the beginning of the semi-finals, where Kong will take on Nelli Differt, the 12th-ranked fencer from Estonia, in the semi-final at 1am Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eszter Muhari of Hungary or France's Auriane Mello-Breton await in the final later.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Grace Brown destroyed the field to claim her country's first gold medal of the Games in the women's individual time trial, her power and bike handling abilities being unmatched by her rivals on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Several riders slid and fell on wet and cobbled corners on the 32.4-kilometre course, with defending champion Chloe Dygert ending up being the biggest casualty and having to settle for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Anna Henderson took third place, one minute 31.59 seconds behind Brown's winning time of 39 minutes 38.24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dygert hit the deck on a corner in the Bois de Vincennes, which effectively ended her chances of retaining her title and cost her second place as she ended 0.87 seconds behind Henderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it was a good day for Belgium in the men's individual time trial as Remco Evenepoel won the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel added the Olympic gold to his world title on Saturday, defying rain and a strong field to win on the 32.4 kilometre course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old was almost 15 seconds faster than Italian Filippo Ganna in second while Evenepoel's compatriot, Wout van Aert, took bronze. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Puddles at the skateboarding arena as Saturday's events were delayed because of rain. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763452_1_20240727215944.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pouring rain in Paris on Saturday forced the men's Olympics street skateboarding competition to be postponed and tennis matches were also delayed, while athletes had mixed feelings about how to cope with the unexpectedly wet weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, a dazzling but soaked opening ceremony for the Summer Games saw thousands of athletes parade on a flotilla of barges on the Seine, at the heart of the French capital, waving to the crowd despite the downpour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese badminton player He Bingjiao laughed when she was asked if she thought the opening ceremony had been beautiful, saying she did not make it because of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I couldn't attend because of the rain. I had to rest," she said. "It's not normal to have had a ceremony like this on the boats. I was watching it on my phone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rain continued on Saturday, forcing some events to be rescheduled and umbrellas were more in evidence than sunglasses at the beach volleyball at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The risk factor becomes too high when skateboarding in the rain," a spokesperson for World Skate said after Saturday's competition was rescheduled to Monday because La Concorde, the outdoor venue where it was supposed to take place, was drenched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening day of the tennis event was also disrupted, with thousands of spectators without tickets for the two main show courts left frustrated after negotiating lengthy queues to get in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Play began on time under the Court Philippe Chatrier roof and across the complex on Court Suzanne Lenglen. But play on the uncovered courts was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Paris 2024 organisers said they were confident the triathlon events would take place as scheduled on Tuesday even though the rain might lead to Sunday's training session being cancelled due to concerns over the water quality in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes themselves were not that bothered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm from Oslo, so this is a perfect Norwegian summer," Inger Seim Kavlie, Norway women's double sculls rower, said with a grin as the rained poured down in the mixed zone, close to the finish line. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton stars Tse Ying-suet and Jordan Tang made a triumphant start to the Paris Olympics on Saturday, defeating their counterparts from Chinese Taipei 2-0 in their mixed doubles opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair from the SAR beat Lee Chia-hsin and Ye Hong-wei 21-13, 21-13 in their Group C game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse and Tang will next play Japan's pair of Arisa Higashino and Yuta Watanabe, whom they lost to in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three duos are fighting for two spots in the knockout stages. A Danish pair who would've also competed in the group withdrew from the Games earlier this month after one of them had issues reporting his whereabouts in line with anti-doping regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the badminton courts, Hong Kong's women's double pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Nga-lam suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Bulgaria's Gabriela Stoeva and Stefani Stoeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bulgarians won 21-11, 21-23 and 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong pair are next in action against the Americans Annie Xu and Kerry Xu on Monday.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday called on the United States to return to a rational and pragmatic policy towards China as he urged Washington not to continue to stir up trouble in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang also urged the United States to "refrain from fanning the flames" in the territorial dispute between Beijing and the Philippines, the foreign ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US side should refrain from fanning the flames, stirring up trouble and undermining stability at sea," Wang said, according to a ministry statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Wang met with his US counterpart Antony Blinken on the sidelines of a foreign ministers meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US hailed the talks between Blinken and Wang as "open and productive" with the two sides discussing issues of mutual concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's talks lasted for one hour and twenty minutes, according to a senior US State Department official. (Xinhua/AFP)

 Fencing queen Vivian Kong on Saturday advanced to the quarterfinals of the women's epee individual event, after defeating the United States’ Hadley Husisian 15-12 in the group of 16 match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one ended the first round with a strong 3-1 lead. Kong then widened the gap further in the second period earning five points to bring the score to 8-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two then were locked in a back and forth contest at the start of the final round, but Kong ultimately advanced to the last eight by bringing in three more points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong had reached the quarterfinals during the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Olympic Committee apologised on Saturday for a gaffe during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in which South Korean athletes were incorrectly introduced as North Korean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the South Korean delegation sailed down the Seine river in the French capital, they were introduced with the official name for North Korea: "Republique populaire democratique de Coree" in French, then "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" in English.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We deeply apologise for the mistake that occurred when introducing the South Korean team during the broadcast of the opening ceremony," the IOC said in a post on its official Korean-language X account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The error sparked displeased reactions in South Korea, that is technically still at war with the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee said later on Saturday that it had received a message from the IOC indicating that its chief, Thomas Bach, wished to directly apologise to the president of South Korea over the phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Korea's sports ministry said in a statement it "expresses regret" over the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second vice sports minister Jang Mi-ran, a 2008 Olympic weightlifting champion, has asked for a meeting with IOC chief Bach to discuss the matter, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's foreign ministry said in a statement it had contacted the French embassy in Seoul which expressed regret over what it said was an "incomprehensible mistake".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea was correctly introduced with the country's official name. (AFP)

    Ledecky edges Titmus in Olympic 400m free heats

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763438_1_20240727193222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American great Katie Ledecky edged defending champion Ariarne Titmus to be quickest into the Olympic 400m freestyle final on Saturday, setting the scene for a titanic battle for gold.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The veteran, who was stunned by the Australian in Tokyo three years ago, touched in 4 minutes 02.19 seconds at a packed La Defense Arena ahead of an evening final on day one of the nine-day meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Racing in the same heat, Titmus went out hard and led through 300m before Ledecky came storming home to win by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall in 4:02.46, well outside her 3:55.38 world record as both swimmers conserved energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand rising star and current world champion Erika Fairweather was third quickest in 4:02.55, a fraction clear of Canadian Summer McIntosh, who snatched the world record last year before Titmus took it back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good to walk out to a full stadium for our prelims race," said Ledecky, who will also swim the 800m and 1500m in Paris but has dropped the 200m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It felt very similar to our Olympic trials a few weeks back, so I'm excited to see the finals atmosphere tonight as well and just happy to get a good first one under the belt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus said the race helped "blow the cobwebs out" and denied coming second gave Ledecky any psychological advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think so. It's a heats swim," said the Australian, who broke the 200m freestyle world record and swam the second quickest 400m ever at the Australian trials last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only job for me was to get in the middle lanes [for the final] and I tried to conserve as much as I could." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong judoka Wong Ka-lee on Saturday bowed out from the Olympics, losing 10-0 to Austrian Katharina Tanzer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong was eliminated in the women’s 48-kilogramme competition by Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she was disappointed with her performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could have performed better, because I thought I had a chance after the draw. I hope I could do better next time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank [my coach and my younger brother] for encouraging me all the time... I was very nervous before the match, but they tried to help me relax."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was competing in the Games for the first time and marked the return of a Hong Kong judoka in the Olympics after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team remained in last place for most of the race, before overcoming Ireland to claim seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au – who's taking part in her fifth Olympics – said the team had put in "100 percent of hard work" to prepare for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On competing in the future, the swimmer said: "I just wanted to swim well this time, simply focus on doing well in the competition, and think about the rest later."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's shooters on Saturday claimed the first gold at the Paris Olympics, with a victory in the 10-metre air rifle mixed team event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventeen-year-old Huang Yuting and 19-year-old Sheng Lihao clinched their victory over South Koreans Keum Jihyeon and Park Hajun, outscoring their opponents 16-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair had earlier topped the qualifying round with a score of 632.2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had fielded two pairs to compete in the mixed team event, including Han Jiayu and Du Linshu, who placed eighth in the qualifying round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kazakhstan, meanwhile, won the first bronze medal in the same event after beating Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, divers Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen won the women's synchronised three-metre springboard event, kicking off China's bid to take home all eight diving gold medals at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Olympians Chang and Chen outshone their opponents in each of the five rounds, finishing with an overall score of 337.68.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds on Saturday flocked to shopping malls to catch the livestream of the first day of action at the Paris Olympics Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At Kwun Tong's apm shopping mall, a woman surnamed Tong said she became more interested in the Games since fencer Edgar Cheung won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also had a message for epee fencer Vivian Kong, who competes on Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We Hongkongers support Hongkongers. I think she's really into fencing and participating in the Olympics is something she wants to achieve. I hope she has a good result and a good [experience]." she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boy surnamed Auyeung, who had just participated in a swimming competition near the mall, said he is really excited about Siobhan Haughey competing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because she swims really fast… I hope to become a swimmer one day as well,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties said many people had gathered at the mall to support their favourite athletes, even before the SAR squad’s events took place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said she expects foot traffic and business at the mall to increase by 10 to 15 percent year-on-year over the next two days, adding that the mall will offer various discounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said the mall plans to broadcast the games from 11am to 11pm.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Saturday narrowly missed out on qualifying for the next round at the Paris Olympics, but moves on to the repechage for another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-time Olympian finished second-last in his men's single sculls heat, clocking a time of 7:00.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said he was satisfied with his performance, which he described as "above-average".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finishing in seven minutes is a rather good time. I had the fastest time [going into the repechage] out of all six heats, so I hope I could perform like this again in the repechage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it's a pity that I was so close yet so far, and missed the quarter-finals by one spot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who is the first SAR athlete to compete in the Paris Games, will next compete in Sunday's repechage.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wang Yi says China has recently reached a temporary arrangement with the Philippines on the transportation and replenishment of humanitarian supplies to Ren'ai Jiao. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763408_1_20240727151822.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Saturday said that top diplomat Wang Yi had said China will "respond resolutely" to any violation by the Philippines of a recent deal to calm tensions between the two countries in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang on Friday called on the Philippines to "honour its commitments" under the deal rather than "backtracking or creating complications", according to a readout of his meeting with Philippine foreign secretary Enrique Manalo at an Asean gathering in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, China will definitely respond resolutely," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said China has recently reached a temporary arrangement with the Philippines on the transportation and replenishment of humanitarian supplies to Ren'ai Jiao in order to maintain the stability of the maritime situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters late on Friday, Manalo said he hoped Beijing would keep its side of the bargain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that would be an important step forward in diffusing tensions and hopefully lead to other areas of cooperation on the South China Sea," Manalo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also warned the Philippines over the deployment of US intermediate-range missiles, saying such a move could fuel regional tensions and spark an arms race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US deployed its Typhon missile system to the Philippines as part of joint military drills earlier this year. It was not fired during the exercises, a Philippine military official later said, without giving details on how long it would stay in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Manalo met in Laos capital Vientiane, host of an Asean foreign ministers meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US top diplomat Antony Blinken arrived in Laos on Saturday for talks with Asean foreign ministers and will also meet Wang. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Saturday said there were at least two cases of flooding in Hong Kong after the Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued in the morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department said it has so far confirmed two flooding cases for the day. One of them was at the junction of Sau Mau Ping Road and Hip Wo Street, near United Christian Hospital, which has since been cleaned up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said two women aged 26 and 59, sustained injuries to their limbs after slipping at the scene. They were both sent to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second case of flooding occurred at Shau Kei Wan Main Street East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department also deployed over 40 emergency teams to inspect flooding blackspots throughout the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal was issued on Saturday morning at 9am and was in effect until 12.50pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several districts recorded over 30mm of rainfall in the morning, while the eastern part of the territory recorded more than 40mm of rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downpour came as an active southwest monsoon brought showers and thunderstorms to the coast of Guangdong and the northern part of the South China Sea.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal rescue organisations on Saturday said rapid land development in Hung Shui Kiu and Kwu Tung have resulted in a significant rise in stray and abandoned dogs, creating a strain on overcrowded shelters and posing public health risks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paws Guardian Rescue Shelter volunteer Kent Luk said that there has been an influx in animal abandonment in the past six months due to an increase in land resumption projects in the North District, noting that the shelter currently has over 300 stray dogs and 150 cats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB called for government support and the implementation of long-term, large-scale animal shelters that provide more adoption, medical care, and animal welfare services to reduce the number of strays on the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The running cost of a shelter in Hong Kong is so high, including the cost of land and labour costs... that is why we recommend the government to provide more financial support," said District Councillor Corey Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau spoke about the importance of balancing urban development with the need to protect animal rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to balance development with animal rights because we think that animal rights will also effect the lives of humans," he added.

    Digital Policy Office to help SMEs adopt technology

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Digital Policy Commissioner Tony Wong on Saturday said the newly established Digital Policy Office will aim to help small and medium sized firms (SMEs) adopt new tech to boost competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong said the office, which is under the Innovation, Technology & Industry Bureau, has three major focus areas, including developing technology-related policies, creating a digital government, and promoting the use of technology in public services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He mentioned that HK$500 million has been earmarked for a digital transition pilot scheme for SMEs in Cyberport. The office will first subsidise the retail and catering sectors to digitalise their operations by installing customer management, marketing, and electronic payment systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The main purpose is to help SMEs learn how to apply basic technology or applications. These applications don't require any changes; they are like items on a supermarket shelf – you can pick and use them immediately,” he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The two industries often interact with many residents and tourists. By starting with them, we believe we will see results quickly. They also frequently encounter pain points and difficulties, such as a lack of manpower."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also spoke on the recent incident where Microsoft experienced a failure in updating its antivirus system, wreaking havoc on firms around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that while the government’s system was not affected by the incident, it indicates the importance of having backup systems and a reminder for all government departments to conduct regular tests.

    'Cross-border organ transfer should be regularised'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health minister said on Saturday the administration is currently in discussion with mainland authorities to streamline cross-border organ transfer arrangements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the Hong Kong Children's Hospital received a cord blood unit from Guangzhou on Thursday to treat a five-year-old girl who suffers from thalassaemia. The patient could undergo surgery in October at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Chung-mau said on a Commercial Radio programme that the Health Bureau hopes to eliminate the procedure of having to file an application and await approval for each cross-boundary organ transplant case to mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only a short amount of time is available when organ transplant is needed [to save a patient], regularisation the organ transfer arrangements can help patients find a suitable organ quickly. It would be best if authorities of two regions can notify the other whenever there is no suitable organ recipients in their area," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the health chief noted that the difference in immigration control regulations on organs between the two regions poses a challenge towards the regularisation process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lo said the government will further develop the SAR's rare disease centre by collaborating with the mainland, so children with diseases in Hong Kong can be given the best treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a rare disease centre in the Children's Hospital with the expertise, the geneticists, and also clinicians who are experts in these genetic disease... in collaboration with the mainland we are developing a rare disease centre, so hopefully in the future our babies and kids with diseases, they will be given the best of care," he said.

    Govt to revise Private Subsidised Sale Flat Scheme
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government will look into ways to revise a pilot scheme that lets developers take on the role of building subsidised housing flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the administration rejected a tender for a residential site in Chai Wan earlier this week, after only one bid, which failed to meet the government's reserve price, was received.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cheung Man Road site is earmarked for at least 700 units with the government setting the price at 65 percent of the market value – with any unsold units to be kept by the developer to sell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, the housing minister said the administration is open to suggestions from the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest rate wasn't lowered as expected so developers feel it's very difficult after doing their calculations. For other terms and conditions our industry friends and professional associations can give us some advice. We will take them as a reference. We have other land to choose from, such as different locations, ground area, or unit numbers. That might make a difference. Give us some time to study this," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government is tendering three sites for development under its Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme, which was announced last year to boost supply of subsidised homes by working with private developers.

    French officials warn attack on rail threatens chaos

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763379_1_20240727090641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French rail officials warned of travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of people throughout the weekend after saboteurs following a meticulous plan paralysed much of the train network on Friday as the Olympic Games started.
 <br>
  <br/>
  No immediate claim of responsibility was made for the arson attacks on cabling boxes at junctions strategically picked out north, southwest and east of the capital where the Olympics opening ceremony was staged on Friday night. Rail workers thwarted a fourth attempt to destroy safety equipment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNCF rail company called it a "massive attack".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts," Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services from Paris to much of France saw mass cancellations and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Eurostar company said it scrapped about a quarter of its trains between London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. It predicted cancelling about a fifth of trains over the weekend and all services will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to take a plane instead of a high speed train to the Olympics ceremony. Four special trains bringing Olympic athletes to Paris, including some US team members, went ahead, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With one of France's busiest holiday travel weekends clashing with the start of the Olympics, SNCF said about a quarter of trains will be cancelled on Saturday and Sunday on the lines attacked. Trains that run will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said thousands of staff worked to repair the damage and try to get services running again. It estimated that about 250,000 passengers were affected on Friday. Junior transport minister Patrice Vergriete said 800,000 could face the fallout over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At each site, the perpetrators targeted fibre optic cables that carry safety information for drivers and control rail changes, SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gerard Due, mayor of Croisilles in northern France, one of the sites hit, said the attackers had specialised equipment to access the cables and then "threw a flammable liquid" on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vergriete said that the saboteurs had been spotted with "vans", while "incendiary devices were found at the scene".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French security forces are on their highest alert to prevent attacks during the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Olympic Games open on Friday after a soaking wet ceremony in which athletes were cheered by the crowd along the Seine as dancers took to the roofs of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France's three-time Olympic gold medallists Marie-Jose Perec and Teddy Riner then lit the Olympic cauldron, suspended on a hot-air balloon, before Canada's Celine Dion sang Edith Piaf's "Hymn to Love", in her first public performance in years, drawing huge cheers from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fleet of barges took the competitors on a 6 km-stretch of the river alongside some of the French capital's most famous landmarks, as performers recreated some of the sports to be showcased in the Games on floating platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time that an opening ceremony has taken place outside a stadium, adding to the headaches for a vast security operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I invite everybody: dream with us. Like the Olympic athletes, be inspired with the joy that only sport can give us. Let us celebrate this Olympic spirit of living in peace," International Olympics Committee President Thomas Bach said as the ceremony came to an end at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mix of French and international stars, including soccer great Zinedine Zidane, 14-times French Open champion Rafa Nadal, 23-times Grand Slam champion Serena Williams and three paralympic athletes were among the last torchbearers before the cauldron was lit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will blaze until the closing ceremony on August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rain forced some fans to leave early, those who spoke to RTHK's Hailey Yip and Kelly Yu were impressed by what they saw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought it was very beautiful," one French spectator said. "Very artistic, very creative, very French, lots of contrast, lots of great pictures, so I think it was fabulous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, crowds cheered as the teams headed down the Seine on a series of barges. The Hong Kong, China team deployed umbrellas as heavy rain struck, with athletes including flag-bearers Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung snapping selfies along the way.

    US stocks rally after better inflation data

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks cheered a benign US inflation report on Friday, powering the market to a positive conclusion to the week despite weakness in tech shares in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in June, from 2.6 percent, amounting to progress in a key US Federal Reserve indicator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped 1.6 percent to 40,589.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 percent to 5,459, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.0 percent to 17,357.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Wednesday, led by a rout in tech shares, which have been seen as overvalued after strong gains in the first half of 2024. Despite the Nasdaq's bounce on Friday, the index finished the week down more than two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to have slowing inflation and solid growth," conditions "consistent with a soft landing thesis," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kourkafas expects more of a "rotation" away from technology to other sectors in the upcoming period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, 3M shot up around 23 percent after reporting better-than-expected earnings and lifting its full-year profit forecast. Analysts see the industrial heavyweight as well positioned following progress on major litigation issues that have dogged the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biogen dove 7.2 percent after announcing European officials gave a negative reading on a new Alzheimer's disease treatment. Biogen and partner Eisai said they would seek a reexamination of the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DexCom, which supplies glucose monitoring systems for diabetes, plunged more than 40 percent after lowering its sales forecast. (AFP)

 Athletes from the SAR and the national team got a warm welcome on the River Seine on Friday evening as the Olympic Games opening ceremony got under way in spectacular fashion in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China team, led by table tennis star Ma Long and synchronised swimmer Feng Yu, represented one of the biggest national delegations in the barge parade winding through the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rain had started to fall when Team Hong Kong, China, entered the ceremony a short time later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung carried the flag at the head of a 35-strong team. Most of the athletes carried umbrellas and many were snapping pictures as they passed the famous landmarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In accordance with tradition, Greece led the procession before the other teams came out in alphabetical order. Hosts France will enter last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other early highlights of the ceremony saw Lady Gaga sing a French cabaret song near Notre-Dame cathedral, a giant plume of blue, white and red smoke sent high above a bridge over the Seine and a winged man played accordion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lady Gaga, surrounded by dancers, sang "Mon truc en plumes" (My thing made of feathers).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water fountains threw up jets of water in the middle of the Seine as the boats went by, with athletes waving at the crowds, amid a huge visible police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony comes just hours after a sabotage attack on the high-speed TGV rail network caused travel chaos across France and put the spotlight on the security risks at a time when all eyes are on the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show started by depicting a fictional scenario in which the arrival of the Olympic flame goes awry, ahead of the extravagant show on the river that will kick off the summer Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French soccer superstar Zinedine Zidane was shown running across Paris to bring the flame, in a pre-recorded video that included him taking it onto the metro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spectators were treated to postcard-like depictions of France and a huge cancan line performed by Moulin Rouge cabaret dancers on the banks. (RTHK/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's police watchdog on Friday said it had launched a criminal probe into an incident caught on video in which an officer appeared to kick and stamp on a man's head while making an arrest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police in northwest England has suspended an officer from all duties following the incident at Manchester Airport on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can confirm we are conducting a criminal investigation into the use of force during events which took place on 23 July at Manchester Airport," said Catherine Bates, regional director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer involved would be formally interviewed "as soon as possible," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video, which has circulated online, caused public outrage and two nights of protests in Manchester and nearby Rochdale. The IOPC said it was looking at the "level of force" used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police has said that three officers were assaulted, with one female officer "suffering a broken nose" and requiring hospital treatment, while apprehending a suspect at the airport following reports of an assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Details of what happened immediately before and after the video remain unclear. Police said the "use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said after seeing the full footage leading up to the circulated clip that it was "not a clearcut situation" and that while the clip was "disturbing," there were issues "on both sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two men were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of assault and assault of an emergency worker among other counts.

    Olympic Games a chance to 'silence the guns': Guterres

<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged countries around the world to stop armed conflict as part of the Olympic truce, with the Paris 2024 Olympics set to open later on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guterres met International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and said the Games were a chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to express the total support of the United Nations to the IOC," Guterres said. "We live in a divided world where conflicts are proliferating in a dramatic way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The horrendous suffering in Gaza, the seemingly endless war in Ukraine, terrible suffering from Sudan to the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo), from the Sahel to Myanmar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment like this it is important to say that the first recorded, in history, real peace initiative was the Olympic truce."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Olympics in ancient Greece all conflicts ceased for the duration of the Games to allow for the competitions to go ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment in which the Olympic Games will start it is time to remind the world of the importance of the Olympic truce and to make the world understand that we must silence the guns," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Games kick off later on Friday and end on August 11 with the participation of more than 10,500 athletes representing 206 nations and territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include a Palestinian team, which while not a full member of the United Nations, has an official national Olympic Committee, as well as athletes from Russia and Belarus, who will compete as neutrals without a flag or emblem following the assault on Ukraine in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this is the moment in which my strong appeal is for countries to come together with the same spirit as athletes will be coming together during the Olympic Games in Paris," Guterres said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladeshi police detectives on Friday forced the discharge from hospital of three student protest leaders blamed for deadly unrest, taking them to an unknown location.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Asif Mahmud, Nahid Islam and Abu Baker Majumder are all members of Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising recent street rallies against civil service hiring rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 193 people were killed in the ensuing police crackdown and clashes, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, in some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio were being treated for injuries that they said were caused by torture in earlier police custody at a hospital in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They took them from us," Gonoshasthaya hospital supervisor Anwara Begum Lucky said. "The men were from the Detective Branch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that she had not wanted to discharge the student leaders but police had pressured the hospital chief to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islam's elder sister Fatema Tasnim said from the hospital that six plainclothes detectives had taken all three men. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former US president Barack Obama endorsed his fellow Democrat Kamala Harris' bid for the White House on Friday, delivering a major boost to her campaign to defeat Donald Trump in November's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's first woman vice president is seeking to make history again in November after President Joe Biden abruptly announced he would not seek re-election after weeks of mounting pressure on him to quit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barack and Michelle Obama's backing will add to the growing momentum behind Harris' campaign, with polls showing she has already narrowed the gap that existed between Trump and Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend Kamala Harris. We told her we think she'll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support," Obama said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this critical moment for our country, we're going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you'll join us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The influential former leader and first black US president was one of the last Democratic heavy hitters to offer his endorsement, with Harris having already received the backing of Biden on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, jumped into the election after weeks of turmoil over 81-year-old Biden, who bowed out after a dismal debate performance against Trump accelerated concerns over his mental capacity and persistently low polling numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since launched a blistering attack on Trump and his "extremist" Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Harris addressed the American Federation of Teachers – the first union to endorse her bid – warning the country was witnessing a "full-on attack" by Trump's Republicans on "hard-won, hard-fought freedoms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic Party delegates have rapidly rallied en masse behind Harris, and the momentum behind her campaign has appeared to catch Trump off guard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bombastic Republican has refused to schedule a debate with Harris, saying Thursday night it would be "inappropriate" until she was officially named the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, a former top prosecutor for California, chided her opponent on X, saying: "What happened to 'any time, any place?'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had previously said of a potential September 10 face-off: "I'm ready. So let's go." (AFP)

    French rail network hit by 'sabotage' on eve of Games

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's rail network was paralysed on Friday by what authorities called coordinated acts of sabotage, which knocked out most of its high-speed train services hours before the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At Paris' Gare du Nord station, a Hongkonger living in the UK said he may have to call off his trip to Brussels because his train had been delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at the station half an hour early and saw my train was delayed for half an hour. And the train is getting delayed further. I’m afraid that it may be cancelled and my schedule will be a mess."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rail operator SNCF said three night-time arson attacks had destroyed cabling boxes at strategic junctions around its network at locations north, south-west and east of Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth attempted act of vandalism south-east of the capital was thwarted by rail workers who spotted intruders in the early hours of Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts", Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics are set to open in a spectacular and unprecedented ceremony on the river Seine on Friday evening, with many ticket holders set to travel to the City of Light by train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With some trains on the Eurostar network – whose routes include Paris to London – cancelled, a traveller in the UK, Saloni Modi, said she was worried she could not make the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nervous about missing it, yes. Because it's something that we've planned and we're looking forward to, and it's almost like a once in a lifetime because you don't get to go to that all the time. So we're hoping we make it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French officials refused to comment on the identity of the culprits of the rail sabotage who appear to have had a sophisticated understanding of the network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the rail disruption, which will affect 800,000 people over the weekend, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach told the media that he had no concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have full confidence in the French authorities," he said at the Athletes' Village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The USA basketball team was also set to take a high-speed train to play their opening game on Sunday against Serbia in Lille, northern France. (Additional reporting by AFP and Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans from around the world gathered by the River Seine in Paris on Friday for the first-ever Olympics opening ceremony outside a stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of boats were to take athletes on a 6-kilometre journey along the river, past major landmarks including the Notre Dame and the Louvre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 300,000 spectators, including VIPs and celebrities from around the world, were expected to enjoy the show from the river banks – a big difference compared to the last Olympics in Tokyo, when the Covid pandemic meant the Games opened in an empty stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A little rain in Paris didn't stop spectators from waiting along the river banks hours before the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca, a tourist from the United States, said going to the Games was on her bucket list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That's why we came, when we found out that four years ago… they were going to have their opening ceremony going down the Seine, we decided that we have to be here,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s amazing, just because you have such a beautiful city and then the Olympics, which is number one on my bucket list to go to an Olympics in what other place to be than Paris.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tight security measures were put in place to ensure safety, including restricting most of the River Seine, and requiring visitors to present a QR code.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours before the ceremony,  France’s high-speed network was hit by arson attacks, forcing many services to be cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ed Settle from North Carolina said he was looking forward to the ceremony in spite of the trouble getting to the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will be interesting to see because it’s the first [ceremony] without the stadium, so I guess how the city can handle it but also how spectators will also be able handle it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We just were able to find this opening here. We've been walking a little bit. Definitely can make it a little bit easier to navigate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening ceremony, from 1.30am Hong Kong time, is expected to last around four hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing champion Edgar Cheung and swimming star Siobhan Haughey are the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China delegation.

 A group of students and teachers from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) are on a two-week trip to Rwanda to serve the local community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  PolyU's Council Chairman Lam Tai-fai, President Jin-guang Teng and Vice President Ben Young also joined the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Department of Computing ventured into rural Rwandan villages to install over 400 solar power systems, bringing electricity to underprivileged households in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, students from the School of Fashion and Textiles brought their expertise to local communities, teaching specialist skills in the textile arts. Their aim is to train villagers to transform fabric into sustainable clothing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its unique advantages to promote new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a seminar on new quality productive forces, Chan said Hong Kong needs to work with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly, we should actively make good use of Hong Kong's advantages as an international financial hub to strengthen all-round capital support for new quality productive forces. Secondly, it's to attract professionals and firms to here," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thirdly, we need to enhance our cooperation with the brother cities in the Greater Bay Area. That will definitely inject momentum into new quality productive forces and high quality development in the area."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Dean of the Institute of Contemporary China Studies of Tsinghua University, Hu Angang, said Hong Kong has an increasingly important role to play in the nation's economic modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to transfer the manufacturing sector from the developed areas near the coast towards the mid-west part area, forming a big domestic cycle. But most importantly, we need to encourage local firms, especially manufacturers, to invest and move overseas, forming a so-called international big cycle," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the main strategy of China's economic modernisation. It is not a single cycle, but two inter-related cycles. The role and status of Hong Kong will not be lowered, but will continue to grow. "
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hu added that the Chinese economy has been growing rapidly and predicted gross domestic product per capita to exceed US$30,000 by 2035.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday appealed to the entire city to rally behind Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the CE highlighted the continued emergence of new talent, adding that he believed all athletes would give their best on the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 35 athletes from Hong Kong, China, will be competing in 13 sports at the upcoming Olympic Games, with more than half of them making their Olympic debut. This not only marks the passing of the torch of Hong Kong sports to the new generation, but also highlights the emergence of new talent in the field," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government has secured the television rights for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These events will be broadcast live on four free-to-air television channels and screened at designated sports centres in all 18 districts, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling for a citywide celebration, Lee urged everyone to unite in cheering on Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.

    Animation-Comic-Game fair begins

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Animation-Comic-Game fair opened its doors on Friday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763285_1_20240726164608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Animation-Comic-Game fair began on Friday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, with hundreds queuing before the doors opened.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event, with more than 140 exhibitors taking part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ho, who was at the front of the queue, said he hoped to buy his favourite toys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I started queuing at around 7, as first place tickets require us to be here from 7 to 7.50, so I don’t want to be late. I’m here to buy deadpool toys for my friend, and I’ll take a look at figures and toys. I am expecting to spend around HK$7,000 to HK$8,000,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Lam, whose stall features Inside Out 2 merchandise, said the expectation was that 80 percent of goods would be sold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Cheng was also optimistic about sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The highlight product will be the plushie from Chikawa, they all are from Japan, they are all very famous in Hong Kong, China and Japan. We also have Mofusand, a very famous IP character in Hong Kong. We hope we can have around HK$1 million in sales,” Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Chung was in the exhibition area, dressed as Kaedehara Kazuha from Genshin Impact. He said he had seen more cosplayers this year, but he had a complaint about the ticket arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The arrangement this year is more complicated. I’m a cosplayer and I have to buy another ticket to get into the cosplayer zone. [It is] somehow too much, but at the same time, it provides a more quiet space for cosplayers and photographers to take pictures, which is a more professional approach,” Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson Woo, who was dressed as Monster 8 from Kaiju No. 8, was also unhappy with the two separate areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[This year] is the worst. Hall 3 needs to pay [to enter], but [tickets are] only for 2,500 cosplayers. It is too low, [and the organiser] doesn't have any more tickets [for cosplayers]. Last year Hall 3 was free and it was very nice,” Woo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the venue, Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong chief executive officer Leung Chung-pun said the visitor flow was similar to that of previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that organisers aim to provide a pleasant venue for cosplayers to participate in the yearly event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My major concern is the welfare of the cosplayers. The atmosphere is not my major concern, as long as cosplayers have a good environment to enjoy their time here, I am happy,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will run until July 30.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB says it will organise a series of events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, including screening patriotic movies and offering free Chinese medicine services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photography competition will enable participants to express how they “love and treasure our home and country” through their work. The winning entries will be showcased in an exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party will also host various technology-related exhibitions in shopping malls across Hong Kong, including one showcasing China-produced electric cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be a poster design competition for secondary students with the theme of “showcasing China's achievements.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will utilise our district network advantage to organise the events,” the party’s chairman Gary Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope every district in Hong Kong can feel the celebratory atmosphere of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB said it will also hold a short video contest to gather tourism ideas that show "the other side of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the contest is not just a celebratory event, but also a response to the concept of “tourism is everywhere in Hong Kong" as expressed by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawmaker said he believes Hong Kong locals are best positioned to identify unique tourism spots within the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs on Friday said they arrested 18 people this month on suspicion of allowing party room and restaurant customers to stream karaoke songs in breach of copyright laws.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they raided 31 party rooms and one restaurant between July 2 and 25, seizing karaoke song players and four gaming devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisional commander for intellectual property technology crime investigation, Shek Ka-yin, said it is the first time customs has cracked down on people allegedly offering karaoke songs via online streaming platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional cases, party rooms or restaurants are installed with karaoke players preloaded with infringing karaoke songs," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this case, instead, infringing karaoke songs which were preloaded in the karaoke devices were put in a data centre, which used the streaming technology to transfer the infringing karaoke songs to the subject party rooms for use by the customers," Shek alleged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs said two people were charged with infringing copyright and violation of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, while the remaining 16 were released on bail.

    Business leaders have high hopes for Asean trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Business leaders who will be part of an SAR delegation travelling with Chief Executive John Lee to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam this month say they hope Hong Kong can strengthen ties with the Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said professional services the SAR offers are in demand in many Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Vietnam lacks skilled labour and Hong Kong companies can help them with skill training. As for Laos, I think its infrastructure is lagging behind and needs Hong Kong's expertise in infrastructure development,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that she hopes to secure tax incentives for Hong Kong businesses in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have already established a bilateral tax agreement with Vietnam and Cambodia, but we haven’t secured that with Laos. I am eager to see if there will be further progress,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Chuang, the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, said a survey found that 45 percent of its 120 members operate in Asean countries, with the majority in Vietnam, a small number in Cambodia and just one in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is a good time to visit Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, given the many business opportunities offered in these countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There have been more factories setting up in Cambodia in recent years. The country also has a young population with strong purchasing power,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I also hope to take this opportunity to understand more about Laos. It is a relatively new market and there’s a new railway connecting its capital Vientiane and Kunming. This is the first major cross-border railway connecting China and an Asean country, which has brought Laos loads of people, logistics and capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chuang added that large companies in Vietnam can make use of Hong Kong’s role as an international finance centre to raise money.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced on Friday that he has reappointed Eddie Yue as chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chan praised Yue's leadership, highlighting the authority's success in maintaining local monetary and banking stability amid challenges in recent years including black-clad violence and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that Eddie will continue to lead the HKMA effectively in the coming five years and make further contributions to Hong Kong's financial, economic and social progress," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Yue expressed gratitude for the finance minister's trust, adding that he will strive to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment, the international financial landscape, and geopolitics are likely to remain complex and uncertain for some time," Yue said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that consolidating and expanding Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is the best way for us to contribute to the prosperity of our country and Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's new five-year term is set to commence on October 1.

 Chief Executive John Lee has told the visiting Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the spirit of the rule of law is highly respected in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive's Office said during a meeting on Wednesday, the SAR leader spoke about the territory's current economic situation, business opportunities and market potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that the SAR government would adopt necessary measures to ensure the safety of people in Hong Kong, adding that all its actions abide strictly with local laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Kuleba had called on Lee to prevent Russia from using Hong Kong as a way to circumvent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kuleba travelled to Hong Kong following more than three hours of talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Guangzhou on Wednesday, which focused on ways to put an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine. (Additional reporting by agencies)

 South Africa shocked New Zealand 14-7 on Thursday to earn an Olympic rugby sevens semi-final against France, while double-defending champions Fiji edged Ireland and will meet Australia in Saturday's medal matches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  South Africa, who qualified for the Games by winning the final repechage slot last month, went ahead with a try by Selwyn Davies, who then delivered a great kick and chase which he scooped up to gift Tristan Leyds a second try, both converted by Leyds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo silver medallists New Zealand closed the gap to 14-7 at halftime through Moses Leo and then hammered at the door throughout the second half but were kept at bay by some incredible South African defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Fiji extended their proud record of winning every match they have played at the Olympics since sevens was introduced in 2016 but they were pushed all the way by a remarkable Irish side who are relative newcomers to the format.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iosefo Baleiwairiki claimed the first Fiji try after 30 seconds but Ireland led 10-7 at halftime after two well-finished tries by Chay Mullins. (Reuters)

    Murray withdraws from Paris Olympics singles

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray withdrew from the tennis singles at the Paris Olympics on Thursday but the two-time gold medallist will play doubles in what will be the final event of his glittering career.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British former world number one, who will retire at the end of his fifth Games, has still not fully recovered from back surgery last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He believes the men's doubles, where he is playing with Dan Evans, offers his best chance of another medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've taken the decision to withdraw from the singles to concentrate on the doubles with Dan," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our practice has been great and we're playing well together. Really looking forward to getting started and representing GB one more time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray won gold in singles at London 2012 and in Rio four years later, as well as silver in mixed doubles with Laura Robson in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His withdrawal means his final singles match was his brief second-round appearance at Queen's Club against Jordan Thompson last month before he was forced to pull out because of a spinal cyst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scot confirmed earlier this week that he would retire after the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Thursday as traders contended with corporate earnings and economic data that came in far stronger than expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy surprised analysts by growing at an annualised rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter of the year – double the level seen between January and March, and well above economists' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 39,935, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to close at 5,399.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also finished the day in the red, declining by 0.9 percent to 17,181.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a strong economic report, so that helped boost investors' enthusiasm," Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin said. "But we also had some a mixed picture on the micro front."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had some disappointments out of Ford, American Airlines, so I think that it's creating perhaps a little tension in the market today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, US auto giant Ford fell by 18.4 percent after missing earnings expectations, leading a sell-off in the sector that left General Motors and Stellantis down 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some cause for optimism as well on Thursday, with health care services provider Molina and digital workflow firm ServiceNow both finishing the day up, by 12.3 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors' attention is also firmly fixed on Friday's inflation data, which is sure to be closely scrutinised ahead of next week's Federal Reserve interest rate decision. (AFP)
