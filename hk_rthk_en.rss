<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday arrived in Riyadh at the start of a new trip to the Middle East aimed at pushing for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and increasing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat will also visit Jordan and Israel on his seventh visit to the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the Israeli assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, Blinken was expected hold new talks with the Saudi leadership on potential normalisation of relations with Israel, a US State Department official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia was considering the step -- which would carry massive significance as the kingdom is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites -- before October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has sought to keep up momentum, dangling the prospect of normalisation to encourage moderation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of Palestinian statehood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will also meet in Riyadh with a number of Gulf Arab and European foreign ministers who are visiting for a World Economic Forum meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will discuss "day-after" plans for reconstruction of post-war Gaza, according to the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans could include funding to rebuild Gaza -- the vast majority of whose people have been displaced -- or support for installing new governance structures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived hours after US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone about ongoing talks to halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce between Israel and Hamas for months, as public pressure mounts for a deal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least four people died, including a four-month-old baby, and scores were injured in the state of Oklahoma after dozens of twisters swept the US Southern Plains, while weather alerts on Sunday put more than 7 million Americans under tornado warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Sunday declared a disaster emergency for the state, freeing up more money for first responders and recovery operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Definitely the most damage since I've been governor," Stitt said in Sulphur, one of the hardest-hit communities, as he provided an update on fatalities and damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stitt began his first term as governor in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a call with the Oklahoma governor, President Joe Biden offered the full support of the federal government to help with the recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm warnings for high winds, heavy rain and hail also were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday for more than 47 million people stretching from East Texas north through Illinois and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NWS reported 38 possible twisters hit the area and that the worst of the storms rolled through Central Oklahoma on Saturday into early Sunday morning, spreading into northwest Texas, western Missouri and Kansas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said area hospitals reported 100 injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twisters destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, including the hospital in the town of Marietta, although no injuries were reported there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20,000 customers in the state remained without power as of Sunday evening, according to officials, as emergency personnel worked to clear roads and repair power lines. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters make their voices heard at a weekend rally in Melbourne. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751006_1_L_20240429115139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will host a meeting of state and territory leaders on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated response towards violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands protested in cities around the country at the weekend to draw attention to the deaths of 27 women so far this year allegedly caused by acts of gender-based violence in a population of 27 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Monday described domestic violence as a “national crisis”, and said the rallies were a call to action for all levels of Australian government to do more to prevent gender-based violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Quite clearly, we need to do more. It’s not enough to just have empathy,” Albanese told Nine Network television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact that... a woman dies every four days on average at the hand of a partner is just a national crisis,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 17 rallies held across Australia over the weekend, with an estimated 15,000 people demonstrating in the city of Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese, his Women’s Minister Katy Gallagher and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth received a hostile response when they attended a rally in the capital Canberra on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters yelled at the government leaders, “we want action” and “do your job.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said there needed to be more focus on perpetrators and prevention of violence. “We need to change the culture, we need to change attitudes, we need to change the legal system,” he told the rally. (AP)

    Art 23 places no limits on press freedom: Paul Lam
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Lam says there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through Article 23 national security legislation. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750995_1_L_20240429111837.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday said national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law places no "extra and unreasonable" restrictions on press freedom and the media can still sharply criticise the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an op-ed published in Ming Pao Daily, the minister said there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration wants the media to pass on accurate, fair and positive information, lead society to make adjustments and seek changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, [officials] need to comprehensively know the ideas, needs and demands from the public [through the press]," Lam wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said so long as the media continue to be impartial, objective and fair in adhering to fundamental professional codes in seeking the truth, there is no need for journalists to be particularly concerned about violating the security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the piece titled "Change and no change", Lam said while the enactment of the homegrown security law last month marked a major change, there are also things that have remained constant such as the values of common law and the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand it improved the legislation on safeguarding national security. It also fully respects fundamental human rights and freedoms on the other," he wrote.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland-based political commentator says relations between China and the United States have improved, but both countries need to work together to resolve conflicts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, was commenting after President Xi Jinping said China and the US should be partners, not rivals, during his meeting with visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, I mean it's better than it was last year at this time. There's at least communication going on. There's more planned communication. It's very important, you have to keep talking especially when you have global tensions like this. There are so many issues that need to be tackled," he said, while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tangen said that, although the Biden administration would most likely continue to see China as a threat, this wasn't the case for business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Business interests are very interested in cooperating and this is a kind of a medium term situation," he said. "You have Elon Musk coming to China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, made an unannounced visit to Beijing, where he was expected to discuss the roll-out of Full Self-Driving software and permission to transfer data overseas, the Reuters news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media said Musk had met Premier Li Qiang, who said Tesla's development in China could be regarded as a successful example of US-China economic and trade cooperation.

    McIlroy and Lowry triumph in PGA New Orleans playoff

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McIlroy and Lowry pose with the Zurich Classic of New Orleans trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750976_1_L_20240429082014.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry won the PGA Tour's Zurich Classic of New Orleans team event on Sunday after a playoff win over Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The USA-French pairing of Ramey and Martin had started the day of foursomes [alternate shot] seven strokes off the lead but a brilliant nine-under par round of 63 saw them fly to the top of the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left the final groups under some pressure to reach the target of 25-under and only McIlroy and Lowry, who played together on the Irish Olympic team and for Europe in the Ryder Cup, were able to get there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Lowry, the 2019 British Open champion, missed a par putt on the 17th, the Irish pair knew they needed to make birdie on the 18th to get into a playoff by tying the clubhouse leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number two McIlroy blasted his drive down the fairway and after Lowry's approach shot left him some work to do, the Northern Irishman produced a wonderful chip that left Lowry with a straightforward five footer for birdie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramey and Trainer had been off the course for three hours and it perhaps showed on the first playoff hole, the 18th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French-born Trainer drove to just behind a fairway bunker but teammate Ramey's 3-wood was hooked far left and after Trainer's chip was short, Ramey missed his putt from off the green, meaning par was the best they could get.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry's approach shot had ended up in a greenside bunker but McIlroy got it safely on to the green and left Lowry with a chance at birdie and victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry has conceded that he has been struggling on the greens of late and he missed the seven-foot putt, leaving Trainer with a putt to extend the playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trainer missed to hand victory to the Irish pairing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was McIlroy's 25th on the PGA Tour while for Lowry it was his third and his first at a PGA Tour sanctioned event since his British Open triumph at Portrush. (AFP)

    Alcaraz passes 'test of fire', Sabalenka survives

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz in action during his round of 32 match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750975_1_L_20240429081318.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz passed a "test of fire" to breeze into the Madrid Open last 16 with a straight sets victory over Thiago Seyboth Wild on Sunday, while Aryna Sabalenka staved off teenager Robin Montgomery to progress in three sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Double defending champion Alcaraz came through 6-3, 6-3 and will face last year's runner-up Jan-Lennard Struff in the next round after another impressive showing before adoring fans on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number three Alcaraz, 20, missed a month prior to Madrid with a forearm issue but returned to crush Alexander Shevchenko in the second round and looks in fine shape ahead of the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still wearing a protective sleeve on his right arm, he had far too much for Seyboth Wild, who had ousted 28th seed Lorenzo Musetti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, the 2018 and 2021 Madrid champion, made the last 16 with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Canada's Denis Shapovalov.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrey Rublev came back from 5-0 down in a first set tie-break to beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 [12/10], 6-4 in a tense affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's world number two Sabalenka scraped past plucky 19-year-old Montgomery 6-1, 6-7 [5/7], 6-4 in a two-and-a-half hour tussle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka broke twice for a 5-1 lead against Montgomery, who steeled herself and battled well in the final game, saving three set points before Sabalenka sealed it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number four Elena Rybakina eased to a 6-1, 6-4 win over Egypt's Mayar Sherif to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mirra Andreeva defeated Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 6-1 to return to the last 16 for the second year running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian, who turns 17 on Monday, won 25 points to nine in the second set against the world number seven from the Czech Republic. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 James Harden and Paul George combined for 66 points as the Los Angeles Clippers survived a 31-point Dallas comeback bid on Sunday, leveling their NBA playoff series as New York took a 3-1 lead over Philadelphia behind Jalen Brunson's 47 points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Clippers squared their best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series at 2-2 with a 116-111 triumph in Dallas, but not before the Mavs erased a 31-point deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George scored 26 of his 33 points in the first half to help the Clippers build their big lead despite the injury absence of Kawhi Leonard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harden scored 15 of his 33 in the fourth quarter, when Dallas – led by the star duo of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic – threatened to match the biggest comeback win in NBA playoff history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irving scored 40 points for Dallas, including a driving layup through traffic with 2:14 to play that gave the Mavs their first lead since the first quarter at 104-103.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic delivered a triple-double of 29 points plus 10 rebounds and 10 assists, but in the waning minutes it was George, Harden and the Clippers who came through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Philadelphia, Brunson broke the New York franchise record for points in a playoff game and added 10 assists as the Knicks pushed reigning NBA Most valuable Player Joel Embiid and the Sixers to the brink of elimination in their Eastern Conference series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OG Anunoby had 16 points and 14 rebounds while putting in an impressive defensive effort against Embiid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart grabbed 17 rebounds but scored only four points as, apart from Brunson, the Knicks struggled offensively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indianapolis, the Indiana Pacers drilled 22 three-pointers in a 126-113 victory over the short-handed Milwaukee Bucks to take a 3-1 series lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner hit a playoff career high of seven three-pointers on the way to 29 points and Tyrese Haliburton added 24 points for the Pacers, who had six players in double figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks, with superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by a calf injury, were also without injured Damian Lillard and saw Bobby Portis ejected in the first quarter after a scuffle with Andrew Nembhard after the two tangled under the basket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brook Lopez scored 27 points and Khris Middleton, who tweaked an ankle in the third quarter but stayed in the game, had 25 for the Bucks, who will try to stay alive when they host game five on Tuesday. (AFP)

    Ukraine warns the situation in the east has 'worsened'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's army leader admitted on Sunday that Kyiv's position on the battlefield has worsened after Russian forces captured another village in the east, pressing their advantage in manpower and ammunition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's troops are advancing in the eastern Donetsk region as Kyiv awaits the arrival of much-needed US weapons that it hopes will stabilise the fragile front lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation at the front has worsened," Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a Facebook post on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian troops had "retreated" westwards to new defensive lines in a section of the front that runs past the city of Donetsk, controlled by pro-Russian forces since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has "a significant advantage in forces and means" and had been able to notch up advances amid "heavy fighting," Syrsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some sectors the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas our troops managed to improve the tactical position," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday claimed its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka in the Donetsk region – around 10 kilometres north of Avdiivka, which they seized in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stark assessment of the picture facing Ukrainian troops comes at the end of week of ups and downs for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States finally approved a US$61 billion package of financial aid after months of political wrangling, unlocking much-needed arms for Ukraine's stretched troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on the battlefield Russia chalked up more successes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its troops managed to make rapid advances in a narrow column to the northwest of Avdiivka. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750958_1_L_20240429033030.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and "reviewed ongoing talks" to free hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack on Israel, the White House said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two allies "reviewed ongoing talks to secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza," the White House statement said, as diplomatic efforts intensified to reach a long-sought truce in the war-battered region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from its global allies to reach a ceasefire, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by the Palestinian militant group during the attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Netanyahu "also discussed increases in the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through preparations to open new northern crossings starting this week," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The President stressed the need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination with humanitarian organisations," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With humanitarian agencies sounding ever more dire warnings of a crisis in Gaza, Israel has come under increasing pressure – globally and from the United States specifically – to allow more aid into the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also "reiterated his clear position" on any Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to send troops into Rafah, where more than 1.5 million civilians have taken refuge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden administration, while backing Israel, has repeatedly voiced alarm over the heavy toll on civilians in the Gaza offensive and has pressed Israel to hold off on any Rafah assault. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City overcame relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest 2-0 on Sunday to close to within one point of Premier League leaders Arsenal and keep the destiny of the title race in their own hands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's team had thrown down the gauntlet earlier in the day, fending off a Tottenham fightback to win 3-2, briefly moving four points clear of City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the champions – chasing an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title – saw off a spirited Forest, with goals from Josko Gvardiol and Erling Haaland in either half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest – fighting for their lives – will rue missed chances, including two clear-cut opportunities for Chris Wood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City remain firm favourites to land yet another league title with four games remaining – one more than Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-placed Liverpool are four points behind City having played a game more and are realistically out of the title picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, last month docked four points for breaches of Premier League financial rules, remain just one point outside the relegation zone with three games to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's City, who came into the match on the back of a 30-match unbeaten run in all competitions, did not have it all their own way at the City ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home team had a chance to take a shock lead in the opening seconds but Neco Williams failed to make clean contact from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest looked dangerous when they came forward, with Nathan Ake forced to stretch to keep the ball off the toes of Callum Hudson-Odoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But City took the lead in the 32nd minute when Gvardiol powered home a Kevin De Bruyne corner at the near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, undaunted, continued to test City but Wood missed a glorious chance to level from close range when found by substitute Gonzalo Montiel, getting his feet in a tangle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guardiola made two changes at half-time, bringing on goalkeeper Stefan Ortega for Ederson, who had a shoulder issue, and introducing Mateo Kovacic for Jeremy Doku.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest were quickly out of the traps but Wood again had a moment to forget after Antony Elanga skipped past Kyle Walker into the penalty box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elanga found the New Zealand international but he scuffed his shot and it was blocked easily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City began to take more control as the second period wore on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland, who has been short of his razor-sharp best in recent weeks, came on for Jack Grealish shortly after the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He eased City's nerves minutes later, latching onto a De Bruyne through ball, evading Murillo before finding the net for his 21st Premier League goal of the season. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Meteorologists are warning of the danger of more extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An exceptional number of powerful tornadoes have ravaged parts of Oklahoma and nearby Great Plains states in the US, with one small town reportedly hit by two separate tornadoes within hours, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After 78 tornadoes were reported on Friday, mostly in Nebraska and Iowa, a separate weather system on Saturday brought 35 tornado reports from northern Texas to Missouri, the National Weather Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least two people, including a four-month-old child, died in the Oklahoma town of Holdenville, according to multiple reports in state and local media, though crews on Sunday were still sifting through the mounds of rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storms dumped up to 18 centimetres of rain in some places within hours, and meteorologists warned of a continuing danger of extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos and images posted on social media showed scores of building flattened in the small town of Sulphur, in south-central Oklahoma, with vehicles smashed or overturned and trees stripped of branches and leaves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postal trucks in Sulphur rested precariously atop the nearly unrecognisable wreckage of buildings, one video showed. Rescue crews went house to house and vehicle to vehicle in search of victims or survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "DO NOT COME TO SULPHUR UNLESS YOU ARE A FIRST RESPONDER!!!" the Murray County sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tornado that struck Ardmore, Oklahoma tossed debris up to 6,100 metres high, the Washington Post reported. Then two other tornadoes came close to the town in the ensuing two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt declared a 30-day state of emergency to expedite aid to 12 of the hardest-hit counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50,000 homes in Texas and more than 30,000 in Oklahoma were without power as of late Sunday morning, the poweroutage.us website reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The region is known for the frequency and power of the tornadoes that rumble through every spring. But having separate major outbreaks in succeeding days is exceedingly rare, meteorologists said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomatic efforts intensified on Sunday to reach a long sought-after truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as Hamas said it would travel to mediator Egypt to deliver its response to Israel's latest proposal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire from its global allies, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by Hamas during their October 7 attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas delegation will arrive in Egypt on Monday to deliver the group's response to Israel's new hostage and truce counterproposal, a senior official of the militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire – a condition that Israel has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the Axios news website, citing two Israeli officials, reported that Israel's latest proposal includes a willingness to discuss the "restoration of sustainable calm" in Gaza after hostages are released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first time in the nearly seven-month war that Israeli leaders have suggested they are open to discussing an end to the war, Axios said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas source close to the negotiations said that the group "is open to discussing the new proposal positively."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The source added that the group is "keen to reach an agreement that guarantees a permanent ceasefire, the free return of displaced people, an acceptable deal for (prisoner) exchange and ensuring an end to the siege" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new hopes of a potential truce came as world leaders and humanitarian groups warned that a looming Israeli invasion of the southernmost city of Rafah would lead to massive civilian causalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas appealed to the US to stop Israel from invading Rafah, which he said would be "the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal held on for a pulsating 3-2 win over arch rivals Tottenham in the north London derby to keep their grip on top spot in the Premier League on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bidding to stay one step ahead of Manchester City in the title race, Mikel Arteta's side silenced the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with a three-goal blast before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's own goal put Arsenal ahead before Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz netted to leave Arsenal in complete control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero and Son Heung-min struck for Tottenham after the interval to set up a nervous finish, but Arsenal clung on by their finger tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal sit four points clear of second placed City, who face struggling Nottingham Forest later on Sunday in the first of two games in hand over the Gunners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last five matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Arsenal are doing all they can to make Pep Guardiola's team sweat as they try to make amends for blowing an eight-point lead in last season's title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the despair of a damaging home defeat against Aston Villa and a Champions League quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich, the Gunners have bounced back impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aware they have little margin for error with City chasing them, Arteta had called on his players to show their hunger for success and they responded to his challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thrashing old foes Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday was merely the appetiser ahead of the main course Arsenal served up for 3,000 of their jubilant fans packed into one corner of the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal famously won the league twice at Tottenham's old White Hart Lane stadium, in 1971 and 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gunners could not clinch silverware on enemy territory this time, but their fifth win in the last seven north London derbies kept them in the hunt to win the title for the first time in 20 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat was a bitter blow for fifth-placed Tottenham, who are seven points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa with two games in hand to keep alive their fading hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing for the first time since a 4-0 defeat at Newcastle 15 days ago, Tottenham should have been fresher than an Arsenal team in action four times over that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sunday's other early kick-off, Bournemouth beat Brighton 3-0 through goals from Marcos Senesi, Enes Unai and Justin Kluivert. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers and families of pupils at an aided Catholic school in Wan Chai on Sunday accused education officials of inaction over the institution's decision to shut earlier than it had originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rosaryhill Secondary School on Stubbs Road first announced last September that it would cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government-aided school later said it would arrange for Form One to Five pupils to transfer to Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No 2 this September. Rosaryhill Kindergarten and Rosaryhill (Primary) School, meanwhile, will be combined with Dalton School Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brother of a Form Five pupil – a former Rosaryhill student himself – expressed concerns about his sister's education at her new school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Education Bureau was relatively passive and not willing to help us on this issue... Pupils are not as simple as assets that you could transfer to others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother of a Form Three student condemned the Education Bureau for not having met parents over the issue, which she said weighed heavily on her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee legislator Doreen Kong urged the administration to address the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We don't want this to happen again. The [Education Bureau] must explain to the public what the principles are and what the policies of the government are in handling all these similar situations,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to come out to help the students and to ensure that there is a smooth transition for all the students, especially to overcome their psychological distress."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said he would file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I find that the school is not professional enough to take care of the students. And the administrative side is also not totally concerned about the rights and interests of students and parents... I want to clarify, during the process, what role did the administration play," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said he would also talk to authorities on pushing back the school’s shutdown, to let senior secondary pupils finish their studies there.

 Police on Sunday arrested a mother on suspicion of leaving her three children at home alone in Tung Chung.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they received a call from her son, 9, shortly after 10am, saying his mother "went downstairs" from the flat at Yat Tung Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said when they arrived at the scene, they found his brother, 2, and sister, 6, were also there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The children were not hurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested the woman, 36, on suspicion of child neglect.

    Govt mulls manhole training for all sewer workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bernadette Linn says the government may require drainage cleaners who don't need to enter manholes to go through manhole training. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750919_1_L_20240428170632.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials want to step up training of sewer workers to prevent incidents involving manholes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her comments came after the death of two workers last week at a manhole in Sha Tin, the same site where two others died nearly two decades ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Linn said the contracts state that workers should only operate on the ground, and if relevant works require them to enter the manhole, only qualified personnel are allowed and risk assessment must be conducted beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said officials are looking into adding clauses to future contracts, requiring workers who only conduct cleaning on the ground to go through training as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you do enter manholes [in future], you have to inform the Drainage Services Department beforehand and receive its approval," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're considering making it mandatory for those doing the cleaning on the ground to also go through manhole training. This is to raise their awareness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Linn said officials are considering whether to immediately prosecute homeowners found to have illegal structures, rather than issuing orders for removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has been reviewing the Buildings Ordinance after cases of unauthorised structures were reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development secretary said the administration is studying whether the prosecution process can be streamlined, the prosecution threshold lowered and relevant fines raised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that a clause in the current legislation stipulates harsher penalties for offenders who "knowingly" violate the law. Linn said officials want to remove such wording, which she said allows homeowners to claim they were not aware of the illegal structures and that the problem had already existed before they bought the place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said officials will make sure the relevant amendments – to be put forward in the final quarter of this year – will be reasonable.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Kevin Yeung said a pyrotechnic display scheduled for May 1 may be cancelled because of bad weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show, hosted by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, is set to be held across Victoria Harbour to kick off a campaign of regular fireworks displays aimed at boosting tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But according to the Observatory's forecast, the weather on Labour Day is expected to be cloudy with showers and squally thunderstorms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for culture, sports and tourism on Sunday said authorities could wait until Wednesday to decide whether the show would be held as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We shall keep an eye on the weather and make announcements as early as possible. It may not be until the afternoon of May 1 that we can officially say whether the display will be affected," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that tourists coming to Hong Kong will be prepared mentally that some performances may not be possible due to the rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the administration is prepared for the arrival of visitors in the coming week, adding that hotel bookings for the Golden Week holiday have been strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Golden Week holiday will help boost businesses in Hong Kong. Of course, I hope if the weather is good, it will be more convenient for those visiting Hong Kong," he said.

    Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel

Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750907_1_L_20240428151400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

    Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU

Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750894_1_L_20240428133152.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists have defended the need for the city to have a minimum wage and called for "reasonable and objective" discussion on the issue, after a lawmaker suggested scrapping the basic hourly rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) said the statutory minimum wage, which is currently at HK$40, is essential to protecting employees, in response to comments by Liberal Party legislator Tommy Cheung of the catering sector that the minimum wage could hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, FTU chairman Kingsley Wong said having a minimum wage in place is a common practice worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main purpose of the minimum wage is to be a policy safety net, to ensure grassroots or the most disadvantaged local workers receive appropriate protection," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the issue of the minimum wage, we should be reasonable and objective. Around the world, many countries and regions in the West and Asia have a minimum wage, so the minimum wage must be an appropriate measure then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also renewed calls for the statutory minimum wage to be reviewed annually, instead of once every two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of a recent string of deadly industrial accidents, the FTU called on various stakeholders such as employers, workers, architects and developers to do their part to ensure occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demands by the federation ahead of this year's Labour Day included priority be given to local labour, better protection for employees who have to stay online after office hours – also known as “invisible overtime” – and standardised contracts of delivery platform workers.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says first quarter economic growth is expected to fall within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.

    'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'
   </title>

'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750892_1_L_20240428114518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Concern groups on Sunday said proposed jail sentences for people who fail to report child abuse should be kept in place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill currently making it way through the Legislative Council, professionals such as social workers, teachers and doctors are required to report suspected cases of serious child abuse, and those who fail to comply face a maximum penalty of a three-month prison term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, calling it too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Wong from the Commission on Children – a government advisory body on child affairs – said the proposed three-month sentence is reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ultimate objective is to protect the children. And, if we set up the penalty level, which is not high enough, the impact is not great, right?" he told reporters after speaking on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why we think that the three-month imprisonment, together with the HK$50,000 fine, is a reasonable threshold, reasonable level of penalty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donna Wong, director of Against Child Abuse, said the proposed penalty should not be lowered, citing the 1,457 child abuse cases reported last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lowering the penalty will hinder the development of the mandatory reporting of the trial bill, because it will lower the effectiveness of the bill and hinder the deterrence effect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said he believes a balance could be struck between bringing in a deterrent mechanism against the non-reporting of child abuse and addressing concerns of professionals who may be affected by the proposed law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the most important thing is we need deterrence against serious cases. But if the cases are minor, as often is the case, we think we can find a package that is acceptable to both the relevant sectors and those advocating for child protection," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Legco bills committee is scrutinising the proposed legislation.

 Hong Kong epee fencer Cedric Ho booked his maiden ticket to the Olympics in dramatic fashion, winning the final qualifying tournament for the Paris Games with victories by a single point in both the semi-final and final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ho, the SAR's top-rated fencer and ranked 52 in the world, defeated Iranian Mohammed Esmaeili 15-14 in the semi-final of the Asia-Oceania zonal qualifiers held in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old then won the final bout 9-8 against Uzbekistan's Javokhirbek Nurmatov to book his trip to Paris this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR has now qualified for 30 events in the upcoming Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Things didn't go as well for Ho's teammate, sabre fencer Low Ho-tin, whose hope for Paris was dashed after he suffered a 15-6 semi-final defeat at the hands of China's Shen Chenpeng, who went on to win the qualifier.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pro-Palestinian protesters stand in front of a police barricade after officers raid an encampment at Northeastern University in Boston. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750889_2_L_20240428112831.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police detained nearly 200 people at three US universities on Saturday as they cleared pro-Palestinian encampments, in the latest campus clashes triggered by protests over Israel's war against Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the East Coast, police in Boston detained about 100 people while clearing a protest camp at Northeastern University, with social media posts showing security forces in riot gear and officers loading tents onto the back of a truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action was taken after some protesters resorted to "virulent anti-Semitic slurs, including 'Kill the Jews,'" Northeastern University said in a statement on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the opposite side of the country, Arizona State University police arrested 69 people for trespassing after the group set up an "unauthorised encampment" on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona State officials said a protest group – "most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff" – had set up a camp on Friday and then ignored repeated orders to disperse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in the US heartland, police at Indiana University arrested 23 people as they cleared a campus protest camp, the Indiana Daily Student newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police with shields, batons and other riot gear broke through a line of protesters who had linked arms, tackling those who did not move, the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campus activists are calling for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas, as well as for colleges to sever ties with the country and with companies they say profit from the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protests have posed a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have carried out large-scale arrests at universities in recent days, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse demonstrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on X, Northeastern said the area on campus where the protests were held was now "fully secured" and "all campus operations have returned to normal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it made the move after "what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that detained individuals who produced a valid school ID have been released and will face disciplinary proceedings, not legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested," the school said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of students remained encamped on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania, despite the college president ordering disbandment after what he said were "credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York, where the protests originated, was relatively calm. Officials there announced on Friday that they would not be calling police back to campus after more than 100 people were arrested last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community," school leaders said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada saw its first campus protest camp spring up on Saturday at McGill University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school in Montreal said such encampments, which are not permitted, increase "the potential for escalation and confrontation, as we have seen at some colleges throughout the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants also took roughly 250 people hostage. Israel estimates 129 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,388 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An ammunition explosion at a base in southwestern Cambodia killed 20 soldiers and wounded several others, Prime Minister Hun Manet said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet said in a Facebook post that he was “deeply shocked” when he received the news of the blast on Saturday afternoon at the base in Kampong Speu province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn't immediately clear what caused it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images from the scene showed several badly damaged buildings still smoldering, at least one with its roof blown off, and soldiers receiving treatment in a hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other photos showed houses with holes in their roofs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four buildings – three for storage and one work facility – were destroyed and several military vehicles damaged, Colonel Youeng Sokhon, an army officer at the site, said in a brief report to army chief General Mao Sophan, posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that 25 villagers' homes were damaged as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kiripost, an online English language news service, quoted a nearby resident as saying a major explosion occurred at about 2.30pm, followed by smaller blasts for another hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pheng Kimneang was quoted as saying the windows of a factory nearby were shattered, and homes as far as a kilometre (a half-mile) away suffered minor damage. Photos of the base show it in a large field, apparently with no civilian structures close by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet offered condolences to the soldiers’ families and promised the government would pay for their funerals and provide compensation both to those killed and those wounded. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's fading Premier League title hopes were dealt a near-fatal blow on Saturday as West Ham rescued a draw against Jurgen Klopp's men while Sheffield United dropped through the relegation trap door.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a dramatic day in the top-flight, Aston Villa's top four challenge was dented by a 2-2 draw against Chelsea, whose furious manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed VAR has "damaged the Premier League" after his side had a late goal controversially disallowed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester United's push for Europe was held up by Burnley in a 1-1 stalemate and Everton secured their top-flight status with a 1-0 win at home to Brentford.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp's glittering reign at Anfield appears to be ending on a flat note after they dropped points for the fourth time in five league games at the London Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool would have moved level on points with leaders Arsenal with a victory at West Ham, at least temporarily, but they failed to make the most of their chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gunners are on 77 points, two clear of Liverpool with a game in hand, while defending champions Manchester City have 76 points with two games in hand on the Reds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarrod Bowen put West Ham ahead shortly before half time but Liverpool looked a different side in the second period, equalising through Andy Robertson before an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the home side levelled in the 77th minute when Bowen wriggled free down the right and lifted a cross towards Michail Antonio, who headed home to make it 2-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp attempted to play down a touchline spat with Mohamed Salah, who was left out of the starting line-up, but the Egypt forward fanned the flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's going to be a fire today if I speak," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's City, who play relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest on Sunday, are hot favourites to secure an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title while Arsenal face a tough away day at Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's 5-1 win against basement club Sheffield United strengthened their push for European football next season but sent Chris Wilder's team down to the Championship after just 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anel Ahmedhodzic gave the visitors an early lead at St James' Park but Alexander Isak scored twice as the home side roared back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have not been good enough," Wilder told the BBC. "The league has been too powerful for us right the way through the season."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle remain in seventh place but are just one point behind Manchester United, who conceded a late penalty in a 1-1 draw against Burnley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazilian winger Antony scored his first Premier League goal of the season but Zeki Amdouni levelled from the spot in the 87th minute, giving Burnley hope they can stay up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said his team, who have a nasty habit of throwing away leads, "gave it away".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourth placed Villa blew a two-goal lead against Chelsea after Marc Cucurella's fourth minute own goal and Morgan Rogers' 42nd minute strike had put the hosts in control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noni Madueke got one back in the 62nd minute and Conor Gallagher curled in the 81st minute equaliser for Chelsea, who felt aggrieved that a stoppage-time Axel Disasi header was disallowed for a foul by Benoit Badiashile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me it has damaged a little bit the Premier League and English football. If we want to be the best league in the world it should be protecting the spectacle and the decision," Pochettino said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The referee is unbelievable and it's ridiculous. It is difficult to accept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are seven points clear of Tottenham in the race to qualify for the Champions League, but the north Londoners have three games in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Idrissa Gueye scored in the 60th minute at Goodison Park to make it four wins out of five for Sean Dyche's Everton, who are safe despite being docked eight points this season for breaches of Premier League financial rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves deepened Luton's woes with a 2-1 win and Fulham drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of people protested in Australian cities on Saturday, demanding more be done to stop violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At events in Sydney and Adelaide, demonstrators carried banners saying "no excuse for abuse" and asked the government to step in and prevent violence that has claimed dozens of lives already this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese backed the protests and vowed to march at further events planned for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A woman has been killed every four days so far this year," he posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments need to do better, men need to step up and as a society, we must do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also took part in a demonstration in Sydney, and said change was desperately needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violence against women has come to the fore in Australia after a spate of high-profile murder cases and a knife attack on a Sydney mall that left five women dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, police arrested former "Home and Away" actor Orpheus Pledger, after he allegedly failed to appear in court to face charges of assaulting a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers in the advocacy group What Were You Wearing have called three days of protests from Friday to Sunday, saying "29 Women have been killed to men's violence since the start of 2024. Enough is enough." (AFP)

 Police said on Saturday that they had arrested a truck driver after an accident at about 4pm in which six people were injured.

 Drivers in mainland China who trade in an old car for a newer model are eligible for a subsidy of up to 10,000 yuan (HK$10,800), the commerce ministry has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China is the world's biggest market for cars, and the most competitive in the electric vehicle sector, with more than 100 homegrown companies racing to make the clean car of the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To boost demand, Beijing is offering the subsidy to drivers who trade in an electric or hybrid vehicle registered before 2018, or a gasoline-powered car that doesn't meet certain national emissions standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who replace a vehicle purchased after 2018 will be eligible for a subsidy of 7,000 yuan, the commerce ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The measure, in force until the end of the year, applies to all purchases of new electric or hybrid vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its announcement coincides with the China Auto Show, where Chinese brands are stealing the show from foreign manufacturers struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Min Hee-jin, CEO of HYBE's sub-label Ador, attends a press conference in Seoul. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750837_1_L_20240427181538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The creative director behind the girl band NewJeans has found online fame after a tearful, profanity-laced news conference in which she slammed some of K-pop's most powerful executives.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HYBE, the South Korean agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, filed a legal complaint on Thursday against Min Hee-jin, the head of its powerhouse subsidiary label ADOR, for breach of trust in business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed an announcement three days earlier that it had launched an audit of ADOR and demanded that Min resign. HYBE's share price fell close to 10 percent after the audit was announced and closed on Friday down 4.95 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, 44, hit back in a news conference on Thursday that drew empathy online from young working men and women who compared her story with their own experiences with unreasonable and jealous bosses who either took credit for their work or failed to acknowledge it fairly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, however, said she had acted inappropriately and unprofessionally by occasionally lapsing into profanity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She denied HYBE's accusations and claimed it was trying to dismiss her unfairly after she accused another of its subsidiaries, BELIFT LAB, of imitating NewJeans with a girl group of its own called ILLIT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, speaking off the cuff and often breaking down in tears, candidly shared her frustrations for more than two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She referred to HYBE's leaders, including chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the man behind BTS, as "gaejeossi", which translates roughly to a "middle-aged or old male fool".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel betrayed by HYBE... they used me until I was no longer of use to them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The live-streamed event, during which even her lawyers appeared embarrassed, had millions of views and drew an explosive public response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parody YouTube video seen by 2.5 million viewers combined a clip of Min speaking passionately with hip-hop music. The t-shirt and baseball cap she was wearing sold out on several online platforms and many others said they had suffered similar experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women who have truly worked (hard) and experienced being undermined by men, along with the dirty side of office politics, could never speak ill of Min Hee-jin," a South Korean woman said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Moon-won, a culture critic who watched the news conference, said Min sidestepped the real allegations against her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No figure as influential as Min in the entertainment industry has ever used curse words during an official press conference, people have really never seen anything like it, so this obviously has attracted enormous attention," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As one of few successful women producers in the industry, Min has been recognised for her arresting visual imagery on numerous K-pop hits, including Girls' Generation's "Gee" and EXO's "Growl".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min said HYBE chairman Bang never congratulated her on NewJeans' debut and that the parent company had given promotional priority to another of its K-pop groups, Le Sserafim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HYBE rejected Min's accusations and urged her again to resign and stop discussing NewJeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts criticised both Min and HYBE over a scandal that has gripped much of South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  K-pop columnist Isak Choi said those involved showed "incompetence and vulgarity by not hesitating to publicly display infighting".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just because Min criticised HYBE's leadership, "it doesn't mean she is free from the rotten issues of this industry", Choi wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She cannot become the underdog simply because she is fighting with the management, especially after having gained astronomical benefits from within it." (AFP)

    Over 800,000 mainlanders expected here for Golden Week

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dane Cheng says it's unrealistic for tourist numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels. Photo: Screenshot of the HOY TV programme" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750821_1_L_20240427161255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Saturday said he thinks major events like the Victoria Harbour firework and drone displays will still be a big draw for mainland visitors during the Golden Week holiday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of measures to prepare for the influx of visitors, such as allowing cross-border shuttle buses to increase service frequency and extending the operating hours of the last East Rail Line train to Lo Wu on some days. The MTR also said it would increase train services on seven rail lines, adding a total of 540 train trips during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland's Golden Week break runs between May 1 and May 5.

Police Commissioner praises Mong Kok CCTV cameras
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750803_1_L_20240427122418.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok this month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.

    Treasury chief says CSRC measures can be a boon for HK

Treasury chief says CSRC measures can be a boon for HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.

    Hamas studies Israeli ceasefire counter proposal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinian youths search the rubble of a building in Rafah. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750810_1_L_20240427135220.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it was studying on Saturday the latest Israeli counter proposal regarding a potential ceasefire in Gaza, a day after a delegation from mediator Egypt reportedly arrived in Israel in a bid to jump-start stalled negotiations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The signs of fresh truce talks came alongside ongoing Israeli preparations for a military push into Gaza's southern city of Rafah and as spillover from the war led to continued attacks across the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, the Hamas movement received the official Zionist occupation response to the movement's position, which was delivered to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators on April 13," Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas's political arm in Gaza, said in a brief statement early Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement will study this proposal, and upon completion of its study, it will submit its response."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas had previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire, something rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been unsuccessfully trying to seal a new truce deal in Gaza ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Israeli media outlets, citing unnamed officials, said Israel's war cabinet had discussed a new plan for a truce and hostage release ahead of the Egyptian delegation's visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been "noticeable progress in bringing the views of the Egyptian and Israeli delegations closer", said Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza was also on the agenda for an international summit set to kick off in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Economic Forum special meeting, scheduled to begin in Riyadh on Sunday, will include a Gaza-focused session on Monday set to feature newly appointed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions with European, American and regional counterparts on Gaza and the regional situation are planned in Riyadh," a diplomatic source said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in besieged Gaza reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight into Saturday around Rafah, the last urban centre Israeli ground forces have yet to enter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans for an Israeli incursion into the city, which military leaders say is necessary to uproot Hamas battalions, have sparked opposition among the international community due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians seeking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP on Thursday that such an operation "will undoubtedly threaten the negotiations" and show "that Israel is interested in continuing the war".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,170 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,356 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel estimates that 129 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. (AFP)

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750796_1_L_20240427112917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.

Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750786_2_L_20240427135328.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.

    Non-plastic prices to fall as use increases: minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan (right) also said authorities must find reliable alternatives before expanding a ban on single-use plastics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750777_1_L_20240427080634.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment chief Tse Chin-wan has stressed that a ban on single-use plastics is not meant to trouble people, saying prices for alternatives will go down further when they become more common.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect on April 22, prohibiting the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse told RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme, which was broadcast on Saturday, that the policy is not intended to make people's lives more difficult but to regulate plastics at source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those disposable tableware, if you switch to the alternatives, the difference is actually very small, usually one or two cents to a maximum of 50 cents for the whole package. Therefore, it's not very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that as more and more will be used in society, the price will go down further. People's behaviour will drive the development of the alternatives, as well as drive down the price of those alternatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said authorities must find reliable substitutes before expanding the scope of scheme, as he ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic products because their use is too widespread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not going to ban the use of all plastics at once. That is not possible... We start with those which we already have readily available and mature alternatives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the postponed municipal solid waste charging scheme, the environment minister said there are proven effects of the policy in Seoul, where the amount to garbage produced was cut by 60 to 70 percent in about five to 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government pushed back the implementation of the waste charging to August, while it held trials for the scheme at more than a dozen premises this month.

    Alphabet, Microsoft power gains on Wall Street

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street closed higher, particularly technology stocks. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750769_1_L_20240427042348.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)

    Inflation indicator may delay expected US rate cut

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest personal consumption expenditures price index may push back an expected interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750764_1_L_20240427022105.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)

    Trump lawyers cross examine ex-tabloid publisher

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A courtroom sketch depicts David Pecker being cross examined by Emil Bove during former President Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence a porn star. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750763_1_L_20240427021510.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former tabloid publisher who squashed potentially embarrassing stories about Donald Trump was back on the witness stand on Friday being grilled by lawyers of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, has testified for four days in the trial of Trump, accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter that could have derailed his 2016 White House campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, the first witness in the blockbuster trial, has outlined under questioning from prosecutors a scheme known as "catch and kill," which involved purchasing and then burying salacious stories which could have been damaging to the real estate tycoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of engaging in "election fraud" by having his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-stakes trial requires Trump to report to the drafty Manhattan courtroom multiple times a week, restricting his time on the campaign trail less than seven months before his likely election rematch with President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in a hallway before entering court on Friday, Trump wished his wife, Melania, a happy birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It'd be nice to be with her but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, whose outlets included the National Enquirer tabloid, testified this week about a hush money payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed to have had a year-long affair with Trump that was a precursor to the Daniels saga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker explained how transfers to the tune of US$150,000 were made to "catch and kill" McDougal's story and suppress its publication, calling it a "large purchase" relative to the sums his company would normally pay for content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said payments to McDougal were disguised as services to American Media, the tabloid's parent company, to avoid violating campaign finance laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We purchased the story so it would not be published by any other organization," Pecker told the jury. "We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or hurt his campaign."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDougal's story ultimately did come out, four days before the election in a scoop from The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said Trump called him and was "very upset."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When it came to squashing Daniels' tale of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Pecker said he hesitated to pay for yet another story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not a bank," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The executive suggested to Cohen that he pay for it instead, which prosecutors say the then-Trump fixer did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The specific charge facing Trump of falsifying business records stems from his reimbursements to Cohen for the payment to Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During defence cross-examination which began on Thursday, Emil Bove, a Trump attorney sought to ruffle Pecker by noting timeline inconsistencies, while also casting the "catch and kill" tactics described by prosecutors as "business as usual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has appeared increasingly disgruntled, angry even, as the trial proceeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained on Friday that the courtroom was "freezing" and that it was "on purpose I believe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

    King Charles eases back into royal duties

<div class="itemFullText">
 British head of state King Charles III will make a limited return to public duties next week, after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by the progress of his treatment for cancer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His first engagement with Queen Camilla would be to a cancer treatment centre on Tuesday. The couple will also host Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan for a state visit in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement follows a difficult spell for the royal family after both Charles, 75, and his 42-year-old daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed that they had cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine, the wife of heir to the throne Prince William, made the shock announcement that she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy just over a month ago in a video posted to social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Announcing Charles's limited return, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said it was "too early to say" how much longer his treatment would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they noted that his medical team were "very encouraged by the progress made so far and remain positive about the king's continued recovery".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pacing of the king's programme will be carefully calibrated as his recovery continues, in close consultation with his medical team," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The king and Queen Camilla will host the Japanese royal couple at Buckingham Palace in late June, the palace said, confirming reports in the Japanese media last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese royals both attended the state funeral of Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September 2022, in their first overseas trip after the emperor's enthronement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also attended the reception the king hosted at Buckingham Palace the evening before the funeral for heads of state and official overseas guests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier state visit which had been planned for early 2020 had to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. (AFP)

    Biden 'happy to debate' Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden has branded his Republican opponent in the presidential race as a threat to democracy. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750761_1_L_20240427014751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden said on Friday he's ready to face off against his White House challenger Donald Trump in a debate ahead of their likely presidential rematch in November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Candidate debates have been important milestones in US presidential elections for decades, helping make or break voters' opinions of the contestants' personal style and demeanor as much as their policy chops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden's team has for months been non-committal about his willingness to participate in the tradition, which is usually held in front of an audience and moderated by a well-known journalist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to debate him," Biden told radio host Howard Stern Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am, somewhere. I don't know when," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ok, let's set it up!" Trump campaign advisor Chis LaCivita said on X, formerly Twitter, in response to Biden's comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presumptive Republican nominee Trump declined to face off against his primary opponents in any debates during the 2024 cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has indicated his eagerness with the man who beat him in 2020, saying on social media earlier this year that he was ready to hold a presidential debate with Biden "ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, who has branded Trump as a threat to democracy, told reporters last month that any agreement to debate the real estate mogul "depends on his behaviour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has already arranged three dates and locations for Trump and Biden to go head-to-head for the 2024 fight, at US universities throughout the country in September and October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump bashed the CPD as being biased toward Democrat Biden when in 2020 it planned to move a third and final debate to a virtual format amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump had himself shown up to the second 2020 debate against Biden only three days before testing positive for Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden at the time had said he would not participate in another in-person debate with Trump while the Republican was still ill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A verbal spar could be a useful opportunity for both the 77-year-old former president and 81-year-old current president to display stamina, as Biden is still dogged by Trump's old "Sleepy Joe" nickname -- and Trump faced online teasing when he appeared to nod off during his criminal trial in New York last week.

 Former England captain Owen Farrell will line up for a World XV when it takes on France in Bilbao on June 22, the match organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old fly-half has been in international exile since leading England to third place at last year's World Cup in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When this season finishes he will end his time at Saracens which stretches back to 2008 to join French Top 14 side Racing 92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The World XV continues to recruit world-class stars and the latest to confirm his presence in the team is England fly-half Owen Farrell," the organisers wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World XV, which will have former All Blacks coach Ian Foster at the helm, already boasts two of Farrell's former teammates for club and country, Mako Vunipola and his brother Billy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fijian flier Semi Radradra and former France half-backs Maxime Machenaud and Camille Lopez, as well as prop Tevita Tatafu, have also agreed to play for the World XV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The prospect of playing for the World XV is incredibly exciting," said Farrell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will be the first time I will have played for an invitation team such as the World XV and joining up with guys you normally line up against for club or country, such as Semi Radradra, Camille Lopez, Maxime Machenaud, in a less pressurised environment is something I am really looking forward to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am sure the players will want to get out there and play in an entertaining manner and put on an amazing spectacle for the Basque and French people to experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No doubt the French team will also bring their notorious French flair come match day too. It should be an awesome week and match in Bilbao."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The match will act as a warm-up for France, who will be missing players involved in the final four of the Top 14, ahead of their summer tour of South America, where they will play two Tests against Argentina and one against Uruguay. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paris is hosting the Summer Olympics from July 26 until August 11. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750757_1_L_20240427013512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Greece on Friday handed over the Olympic flame of the 2024 Games to Paris organisers in a ceremony at the Athens marble stadium where the competition was revived nearly 130 years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hellenic Olympic Committee chairman Spyros Capralos handed the torch to Paris Olympics chief organiser Tony Estanguet at the Panathenaic Stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Estanguet said the goal for Paris was to organise "spectacular but also more responsible Games, which will contribute towards a more inclusive society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers want to ensure "that the biggest event in the world plays an accelerating role in addressing the crucial questions of our time," said Estanguet, a member of France's Athens 2004 Olympics team who won gold in the slalom canoe event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A duo of French champions, Beijing 2022 ice dance gold medallist Gabriella Papadakis and former swimmer Beatrice Hess, one of the most successful Paralympians in history, carried the flame during the final relay leg into the Panathenaic Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nana Mouskouri, the 89-year-old Greek singer with a worldwide following, performed the anthems of France and Greece at the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending the night at the French embassy in Athens, the flame on Saturday will begin its journey to France on board the 19th-century three-masted barque Belem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the ship will pass from the Corinth Canal -- a feat of 19th century engineering constructed with the contribution of French banks and engineers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belem is set to reach Marseille -- a city founded by ancient Greek colonists around 600 BCE -- on May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 1,000 vessels will accompany its approach to the harbour, local officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first torch bearer in Marseille. His sister Laure was the second torch bearer in ancient Olympia, where the flame was lit on April 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories. (AFP)

    Govt lowers Sha Tin Trunk Road estimated cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has put forward minor tweaks to the planned construction of a new road in Sha Tin in hopes of cutting the estimated cost of the project by five percent to HK$6.81 billion amid criticism of its hefty price tag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a revised funding request for the Trunk Road T4, the administration said the changes would not affect the functionality of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to concerns currently about the situation of public finances, we tried to reduce the cost of this project as much as possible," the Legco paper wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to win the support of lawmakers so that the project can be carried out in a timely manner and avoid delaying yet again the long-term development of New Territories East and the Northern Metropolis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities last month withdrew its application to the Legislative Council of more than HK$7.1 billion in funding for the planned T4 project, which connects major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River, as critics questioned whether the scheme is worth the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cut cost, the government said it will switch to using traditional materials to build noise barriers for the project, which in turn is expected to save HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will not affect the function of noise barriers. Currently, traditional materials are commonly used in other construction projects," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other changes include scrapping a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reducing the number of elevators at footbridges to further shave off around HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to discuss the revised funding request during a Finance Committee meeting next week.

    ICAC sees 30 percent jump in property management cases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday said it received 30 percent more complaints relating to the property management sector in 2023, compared to the year before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it received 236 reports, up from 182 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Corinna Wong, the ICAC’s director of community relations, said many of the reports last year were linked to repairs and maintenance contracts, with allegations that some were awarded through bribery or that they came with exaggerated price tags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complainants alleged that some property management firms took bribes from jobseekers, or fabricated duty records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said there were 51 such corruption reports in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while there may be "rotten apples" in the industry, the increase in complaints does not mean that the sector has become more corrupt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes after we investigated corruption cases, and they were widely reported by the press, members of the public may become aware of that particular case and then may come forward to report to us similar cases," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the property management sector, after the ICAC operations department discovered several cases last year, there was a slight increase in the corruption cases we received."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft watchdog said it is working with the Property Management Services Authority to offer training for companies and workers to enhance integrity standards across the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority’s vice-chairperson, Eddie Hui, noted that property management workers must now obtain a licence, and that all of them will need to receive training in areas including anti-corruption awareness starting in 2025.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they had enhanced enforcement to combat traffic violations associated with taxis, tour buses and illegal cabs at renowned tourist sites as part of preparations for the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing near the Peak Tram station in Central, Inspector Lai Cheuk-fung said during the first three months of the year, police had received 23 complaints about taxis, with grievances about over charging commonly cited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai said officers would enhance their enforcement efforts starting from Wednesday this week to May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police would also strengthen education by introducing "taxi ambassadors" to provide taxi-related information to travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from enforcement, we would like to introduce a multi-agency approach to tackle this problem. Apart from tackling the problem in Hong Kong, we would like to consolidate Hong Kong's place as an international tourist destination. And this is our ultimate goal," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, senior investigator at the Travel Industry Authority, Mark Cheng, said authorities would beef up their manpower to monitor famous tourist spots and border control points, as around 680 mainland tour groups are expected to visit Hong Kong during Golden Week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)

Police arrest 61 in dozens of online drugs cases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they arrested 61 people, including five minors, in the past month for allegedly selling drugs online.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the suspects, aged between 14 and 59, are suspected of involvement in 43 cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they seized 128 kilogrammes of drugs, including cannabis buds, cocaine and magic mushrooms, as well as electronic cigarette pods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hauls were worth about HK$38 million in total, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said drug syndicates have created channels and groups on Telegram to sell cannabis products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Syndicates imported a large amount of cannabis oil from overseas countries to Hong Kong. They then processed the cannabis oil and mixed it into chocolates, candies and cookies, and sold them on social media platforms. In terms of appearance, they looked the same as normal products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charm added that some electronic cigarette pods have been found to contain etomidate, warning that even a small amount of the controlled drug can cause death.

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

 Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarisation grows over Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Voting opened at 7am in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But turnout in the first round of voting last week dropped nearly four points to 66 percent from the last election in 2019, with speculation in Indian media that higher-than-average temperatures were to blame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second round of the poll -- conducted in phases to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country -- includes districts that have this week seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outcome of Friday’s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 970 million voters will elect 543 members from a total 28 states to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election that runs until June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes will be counted on June 4. (Agencies)

Man arrested for having firearms without a licence

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Friday said they arrested a man on suspicion of possessing firearms without a licence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers found 18 guns, 11 knives, and four daggers at a self-storage facility in Sha Tin, and arrested the 67-year-old suspect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Superintendent Cheung Ting-fung said the man had previously held licences for various types of guns, but these were revoked in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said it is suspected that all the firearms found at the storage facility this week were obtained illegally from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the case was not related to the social unrest in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, we do not have any evidence showing that the arrested person is connected to any previous riot or violent cases. We tend to believe that this arrested person is just a firearms fanatic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case will be heard at the Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts on Friday afternoon.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.

 Chief Executive John Lee said cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai was entering a new phase as the CE met with the city's mayor for a major conference on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the sixth plenary session of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Co-operation Conference, Lee said the two cities would sign 20 cooperation documents and reach consensus on 65 projects in areas such as innovation technology, industrial development, digital economy and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the first meeting in 2003, the two cities have been engaging in more frequent exchanges... Hong Kong has become one of the major export markets and also the largest source of foreign investment into Shanghai," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said these exchanges created opportunities and built a win-win situation for the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We sincerely hope that the two cities can take the opportunity of signing a new round of cooperation documents to integrate our development strategies comprehensively, create highlights for our cooperation and together push Hong Kong-Shanghai cooperation to a new phase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong Yin Zonghua, Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan, were among the other leaders and officials at the meeting.

    Embiid's 50 propels Sixers over NY, Magic rout Cavs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joel Embiid shoots past New York Knicks forward Precious Achiuwa. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750641_1_L_20240426110554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid scored 50 points to power the 76ers to a vital 125-114 victory over the New York Knicks on Thursday, the Sixers clawing back a game in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 76ers had dropped the first two games of their best-of-seven first-round series at Madison Square Garden, Embiid defiantly insisting they were the "better team" and would right the ship at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made sure they did, and the Orlando Magic also bounced back in a big way after going 0-2 down against the Cavaliers in Cleveland, routing the Cavs 121-83 to trim their series deficit to one game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid posted a career playoff high, connecting on 13 of 19 shots including five of seven from three-point range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made seven of eight attempts on the way to 18 points in the third quarter, when the Sixers erased a three-point halftime deficit and pushed their lead to 13 going into the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid added eight rebounds, four assists and a blocked shot and was assessed a flagrant foul for pulling Mitchell Robinson to the court by the ankle in the first quarter – moments after Embiid had been sent crashing by Knicks forward OG Anunoby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 13 assists. Josh Hart scored 20 points but game two hero Donte DiVincenzo had just five and the 76ers will have a chance to level the series on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Orlando, Paolo Banchero scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds as the Magic clawed back to 2-1 after dropping the first two games of the Eastern Conference series in Cleveland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-point win marked the third-largest margin of victory in a playoff game in Magic history – and their first home playoff win since a 2011 first-round win over Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just wanted to come out and be aggressive," Banchero said. "Going down 3-0 is a lot different than being down 2-1. So [I] knew we had to get this game – and we've got to do it again on Saturday." (AFP)
