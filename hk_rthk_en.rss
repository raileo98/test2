<div class="itemFullText">
 Derrick White scored 38 points as the top-seeded Boston Celtics scored a dominant 102-88 road victory Monday over the Miami Heat to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After an enthusiastic 20-point win over Miami in game three Saturday, Boston picked up where they left off with another emphatic performance over last season's Eastern Conference champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White set the tone for Boston with an electric first quarter display, rattling in 16 points in the opening frame – including four three-pointers – to help the Celtics take a 10-point lead heading into the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston then kept up the pressure with the scoreboard ticking over to open up a 53-36 half-time lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics stretched the lead to 28 points at one stage in the third quarter, and even though Miami rallied in the fourth, narrowing the deficit to 13 points with just over five minutes remaining, Boston's grip on the lead never looked in serious jeopardy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win means the Celtics can clinch their place in the second round, where they will face either Orlando or Cleveland, with a win in game five Wednesday back in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday's evidence, few would bet against Boston bringing the series to a swift conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White insisted Boston would take nothing for granted as they attempt to close out the series in front of their home fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's going to be a tough game five. We know they ain't going away so we've got to be ready to go," White said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White was given scoring support from Jayson Tatum, who finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds and five assists, while Jaylen Brown added 17 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miami, once again without the injured Jimmy Butler, were led by Bam Adebayo with 25 points, while Tyler Herro added 19 and Caleb Martin 18. (AFP)

    China factory activity slows in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Official Chinese data showed slower manufacturing growth in April. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751150_1_L_20240430103806.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in April, an official factory survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting some loss of momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 50.4 in April from 50.8 in March, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and just ahead of a median forecast of 50.3 in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data underlines the challenges facing policymakers even though solid first quarter GDP growth had reduced some of the urgency to ramp up stimulus measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New export orders grew at a much slower rate, while employment continued to shrink, the NBS's PMI data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, a private Caixin factory survey, which was also released on Tuesday, showed manufacturing activity grew more quickly as new export orders rose, providing a more optimistic outlook than the official data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors expect Beijing to launch more stimulus to support the economy and were waiting for the outcome of a politburo meeting, which is expected to focus on economic affairs this month. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician said on Tuesday that Hong Kong's flu season is running longer than normal this year, with cases still increasing rather than tapering off as expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=949557&livetime=20240430000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  </a>
  programme that the extended flu season reflected a global phenomenon, with people's immunity against viruses falling when measures were imposed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says Hong Kong now faces what he called a tridemic, with people threatened by flu, Covid and another respiratory infection, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, as well as other conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked when the flu season would conclude, he told RTHK's Janice Wong: "We cannot make a prediction yet because the number is still rising and we are still seeing so many of the severe cases. Unfortunately, we hear about the news of another fatal case yesterday. This is very sad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I cannot make a prediction at this moment, but I just hope that the citizens can just go and have the flu vaccine if they have not yet received the vaccine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said acceptance of the flu vaccine remained relatively low in Hong Kong. He also suggested people wear masks in crowded areas, use proper hygiene and stay home if they have the flu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of an NGO said on Tuesday that many Hong Kong social workers are experiencing burnout as they face a range of challenges, including an increasing workload as more people in society face difficulty with their mental health.

  programme,  Chou Wah-shan from the mental health group Dreams Possible said a survey conducted with University of Hong Kong academics found that ninety-three percent of the 255 social workers interviewed experienced a moderate level of work-related stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the study also found signs of depression in 68 percent of the interviewees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The issue of burning out is becoming more and more alarming," he told RTHK's Samantha Butler. "Because I think in the past couple of years, Hong Kong has been facing huge challlenges in many aspects: socio-economic, political.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also, many people are feeling frustrated and are having emotional and mental illness issues. That's why the workload of social workers, as the helping profession, has immensely increased, together with the intensity of clients' emotional issues, including emotional issues, depression, anxiety disorder or even suicidal issues."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kelce and the Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in a row in February. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751128_1_L_20240430081139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time Super Bowl champion tight end Travis Kelce, better known to many as singer Taylor Swift's sweetheart, said on Monday he has signed a two-year contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old American signed a deal to stay with the Chiefs through 2027 for US$34.25 million and become the NFL's highest-paid tight end, according to multiple reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Back at it again baby," Kelce said in a video posted by the Chiefs on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Feels good to be in KC. I remember coming here 12 years ago, man. It's an honor and a pleasure and I can't wait to get after it these next two years but no better than right now getting fired up for this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just got out on the field with the boys. We're back at it baby. Chiefs forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelce just missed an eighth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season in 2023, catching 93 passes for 984 yards and five touchdowns this past campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I told yall I'll never let him leave!! Congrats my guy! @tkelce," Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 159 career games over 11 NFL seasons, all with the Chiefs, Kelce has caught 907 passes for 11,328 yards and 74 touchdowns
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We signed the greatest tight end ever to a new contract," the Chiefs posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelce has caught an NFL record 165 passes in the playoffs for 1,903 yards and 19 touchdowns for a Chiefs squad that has reached the AFC Championship six consecutive years and the Super Bowl in four of the past five seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in a row in February and also won the 2020 Super Bowl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift attended many of Kelce's games, often watching alongside his mother, bringing the NFL and Chiefs in particular extra attention from Swift's devoted fan following. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Monday, extending a rally from late last week ahead of a Federal Reserve decision and key earnings reports in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A news-jammed week includes Wednesday's Fed decision, where the central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but will update investors on the prospects for cuts.
  <br/>

  Investors will also digest April jobs data, as well as surveys measuring manufacturing sector health and consumer confidence.

    Premier League clubs agree new spending cap - reports

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Defending champions Manchester City reportedly rejected the proposal. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751109_1_L_20240430043736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs have reportedly agreed in principle to introduce a spending cap to limit the gap in financial muscle between sides at the top and bottom of the English top flight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clubs will be limited to spending a multiple of the amount of money accrued in television rights by the lowest-earning club in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Athletic reported "the anchoring" plan will be capped at five times the amount the lowest earning side receives via the Premier League's broadcast deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures for last season show the bottom club, Southampton, were paid £104 million (US$130 million) in TV money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said that clubs are expected to be assured that any cap would not cause any of them to reduce spending from their present level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan received at least the 14 votes necessary from the 20 clubs to be approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But defending champions Manchester City, Manchester United and Aston Villa are among those to have reportedly rejected the proposal, with Chelsea said to have abstained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved at an annual general meeting in June, the new model will replace the controversial Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) from the 2025-26 season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton and Nottingham Forest have been docked points this season due to breaches of PSR, which allows clubs to lose only £105 million over a three-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of other clubs are close to crossing that limit, which led to a massive downturn in spending during the January transfer window.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics of a cap on spending believe it could hinder the Premier League's position as the richest and most watched league in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Players' union the Professional Footballers' Association have also opposed "any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, those in favour of the plans cite increasing Champions League revenue for the top teams and the spending power of state-backed clubs such as City and Newcastle as justification for limiting spending to maintain a competitive balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier League clubs have already agreed to follow Uefa's new financial fair play regulations from 2025/26 by limiting spending to 85 percent of their total revenue on wages, transfer payments and agents' fees. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday it was "not too late" for Ukraine to win the war, agreeing with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Kyiv needs more weapons, while Russian forces advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg was in Ukraine when Russia claimed the capture of two eastern villages in 24 hours, rushing an advance in the Donetsk region before crucial US weapons reach Kyiv's exhausted forces on the front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition... But it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail," the Nato secretary general said at a press conference with Zelensky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said months-long delays in US military aid to Ukraine had "serious consequences on the battlefield."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said that "more support is on the way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," he promised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has been dependent on Western military aid to counter Russia's larger and more powerful army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky urged faster deliveries to bolster the front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of the situation when we are expecting supplies from our partner," the Ukrainian leader said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why promptness in supply literally means stabilisation of the front line," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together we must disrupt the Russian offensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking of the long-awaited aid, Zelensky said "some things have started to arrive" but declined to "go into details."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden gave final approval for the aid – blocked in Congress for months – last week, saying shipments will start "right away."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Ukraine said the situation was deteriorating for its troops in the eastern Donetsk region. (AFP)

    Dozens killed as dam bursts in flood-hit Kenya

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 46 people including children died when a makeshift dam burst its banks in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early hours of Monday, a local official said, as torrential rains and floods battered the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people have been killed over the March-May wet season in Kenya as heavier than usual rainfall pounds East Africa, compounded by the El Nino weather pattern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents said the accident occurred in the dead of night when the dam burst near the town of Mai Mahiu in Nakuru county, sending torrents of water and mud gushing down a hill and engulfing everything in its path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deluge cut off a road, uprooted trees, washed away homes and sent vehicles flying, devastating the village of Kamuchiri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard what sounded like an earthquake and roars like a moving train," said Margaret Wangechi, a 52-year-old teacher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, said on Monday evening that there were 46 bodies at the mortuary, but warned that the number could increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included 20 women and 17 children, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nakuru governor Susan Kihika said 110 people were being treated in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers dug through the debris, using hoes and in some cases just their bare hands in a desperate search for survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We collected some of the bodies held by trees and we don't know how many are under the mud," Stephen Njihia Njoroge, a local resident involved in the emergency efforts, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disaster occurred at Old Kijabe dam, a hillside barrier formed naturally over decades after railway construction work by Kenya's former British colonial rulers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Red Cross has set up a desk at a local school to help families find lost loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the government had called for inspections of all dams and reservoirs within 24 hours in case there is a need for evacuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said on X that the authorities would arrest people engaging in "risky behaviour," including motorists attempting dangerous crossings and anyone seeking to transport "passengers across flooded rivers or storm water by unsafe canoes or boats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a crowded boat capsized at the weekend in flooded Tana River county in eastern Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kindiki said two bodies had been found and 23 people rescued, and that search and rescue efforts were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kenyan government spokesman said on Monday that 103 people had lost their lives in floods since March, in a statement that did not mention the dam disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 28,000 households have been displaced and over 185,000 people affected, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The education ministry announced on Monday it would postpone the reopening of schools following mid-term holidays to May 6 because of the rains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weather has also wreaked havoc in neighbouring Tanzania, where at least 155 people have been killed in flooding and landslides. (AFP)

    Rubiales denies 'irregularities' in graft case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's former football head Luis Rubiales says he is cooperating fully with the corruption investigation. Photo:
AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751104_1_L_20240430013531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Disgraced former Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales denied any financial "irregularities" on Monday after testifying in court in a corruption probe into his time in charge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "What I maintain, and will always maintain, and I am convinced that justice will (demonstrate), is there has never been any money received in an irregular way," Rubiales told reporters after leaving the Madrid court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales, 46, who resigned following global outrage after he forcibly kissed Women's World Cup star Jenni Hermoso on the lips last summer after the final, testified at length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have answered all the questions I was asked, if I have to come here again I will be here, collaborating – I am the one most interested in clearing everything up," said Rubiales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales must appear in court every month and ask permission from the judge before making any trips outside of Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales was briefly detained on his return to Spain from the Dominican Republic at the start of April as part of a probe into federation (RFEF) contracts signed since 2018, including one signed by Rubiales to take the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has never been any irregular tender, we have been paid with the utmost excellence and in the pursuit of legality," added Rubiales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On March 20 investigators searched Rubiales' house in the southern city of Granada among 11 locations in the alleged graft scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids were part of "an investigation linked to presumed crimes linked with corruption in business, fraudulent administration and money laundering," according to judicial sources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Super Cup contracts are worth 40 million euros a year (US$43.3 million) with the deal brokered by Kosmos, a company owned by former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish Super Cup took place for the first time in Saudi Arabia in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It returned to Spain for a year during the Covid-19 pandemic but the subsequent three editions have returned to the oil-rich Gulf state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Spanish football president Pedro Rocha is also under investigation in the alleged graft case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rocha served as federation vice-president under Rubiales, then replaced him on an interim basis before being elected as chief this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales is also set to go on trial over the non-consensual kiss on Hermoso's lips, which under Spanish law can be classed as sexual assault. (AFP)

    Blinken 'hopeful' Hamas will accept Gaza deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday he was hopeful Hamas would accept an "extraordinarily generous" offer to halt Israel's Gaza offensive in return for the release of hostages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel," Blinken said in Riyadh at the World Economic Forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to decide – and they have to decide quickly," Blinken said. "I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can have a fundamental change in the dynamic" in more than half-a-year of bloodshed, Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A delegation from Hamas was due on Monday in Egypt, which with Qatar has been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli offensive and see hostages freed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also discussed the ceasefire proposal on Monday in Riyadh with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, where Hamas maintains an office and the militants' chief Ismail Haniyeh is a frequent visitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken in the talks with Fidan "urged that all efforts be brought to bear to convince Hamas to accept the immediate ceasefire proposal that is on the table," a State Department statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey recognises Israel but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strident critic of its Gaza offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erdogan has voiced an eagerness for a greater role in mediating the Gaza conflict after Qatar in recent weeks indicated it would take a step back. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said that after a period of reflection about his future he had decided to continue as the country's leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said he had informed King Felipe VI of his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His decision to continue draws a line under a week in which Spanish politics was thrown into further turmoil by the prospect of facing another parliamentary vote to choose a new prime minister or even a fourth general election in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, 52, surprised both foes and allies alike when he said last Wednesday he was taking several days away from public duty to consider quitting, provoking large demonstrations from his followers in the country over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his announcement on the same day a court said it would investigate his wife, Begona Gomez, for influence peddling and business corruption, allegations he said were false and orchestrated by his conservative opponents. (Reuters)

    Inquest experts differ over patient's liver failure

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Professor Henry Pleass says Tang Kwai-sze’s acute liver failure was absolutely because of a hepatitis B flare-up. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751062_1_L_20240429173646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transplant surgeon has stressed that a second organ transplant for a liver disease patient was the only way to keep her alive, as the Coroner’s Court heard conflicting explanations as to why the patient developed acute hepatic failure before her death.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017 and died in August that same year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Pleass, a transplant surgeon in Australia, said it was unfortunate that medical practitioners did not give Tang medication needed along with the steroids she was taking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s our modern system with many other doctors looking after one individual. There’s no continuation,” he told the inquest's five-person jury and coroner Monica Chow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We made the assumption that people have thought about the issue, and thought about the risks.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had experienced medical issues after the first transplant and Pleass said while doctors could have treated her conservatively, the surgery for a new organ gave her a chance of survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the cause of Tang’s liver failure, Pleass said it was “absolutely” because of a hepatitis B flare-up, ruling out the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis as suggested by another expert witness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, histopathologist Wilson Tsui said it was more likely that Tang suffered from autoimmune hepatitis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the high count of plasma cells and the absence of serologic markers, which are used to identify antibodies formed following an infection, indicated that a hepatitis B flare-up was less likely to have been the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To differentiate between a reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis, [the count of plasma cells] is a relatively important index,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But James Fung, an expert witness called to give evidence again after Tsui’s testimony, said the majority of patients with an acute hepatitis flare-up would still test negative for such serological markers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung, a transplant hepatologist at Queen Mary Hospital, also noted that while a higher count of plasma cells is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, there could be exceptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially with very severe acute flares of hepatitis B, [plasma] cells themselves are often seen in these severe cases,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing continues.

    Govt to adopt new heatstroke rules for outdoor workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Labour Department says its updated guidelines on when outdoor workers should take a break under hot weather conditions will take effect next month. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751046_1_L_20240429163232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Monday said they were updating guidelines on when outdoor workers would be advised to stop working when it's very hot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This would enable the department’s heat stress warning system to be in line with the observatory's warnings about hot weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory’s "extremely hot special alert" is issued when it's generally 35 degree Celcius and above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some environmental and workers' groups had called for such a linkage between the two alert systems last year when the department’s guidelines were introduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said the updated guidelines would apply next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guidelines also set out the varying lengths of breaks workers should be given every hour when the heat stress warnings are in effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new rules state that if employers adopt a certain amount of measures to prevent heatstroke - such as reducing workload, providing shades and using mist fans to improve ventilation - they can completely cut the hourly breaks for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If insufficient measures were adopted, the guidelines said, employers would be required to give longer breaks to workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employers would be given flexibility to alternate break times for different workers, and they can split break periods into shorter ones so as to minimise the effects on work progress.

 The Foreign Ministry on Monday announced that President Xi Jinping will pay state visits to France, Serbia and Hungary from May 5-10.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the French government, Xi is due to make a state visit to France on May 6-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bilateral relations with Paris have maintained sound growth momentum, and both countries have had strategic communications and practical cooperation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said in discussing the president's trip to France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China looks forward to working with France to further enhance political mutual trust, solidarity and cooperation," Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be Xi's first European tour since the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This visit takes place on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries and follows on from the president's visit to Beijing and Guangzhou in April 2023," French President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exchanges will focus on international crises, first and foremost the war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, trade issues, scientific, cultural and sporting cooperation," the Elysee office said. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ho Kai-ming says society will have to bear the consequences if the threat of prison is scrapped from the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751038_1_L_20240429153738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Undersecretary for Labour and Welfare, Ho Kai-ming, on Monday said jail terms for professionals who fail to report suspected child abuse cases should be kept in the draft legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, which is currently making its way through the Legislative Council, the maximum penalty for not reporting suspected severe child abuse cases would be a three-month jail term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, saying it is too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legco's bills committee, Ho reassured lawmakers that professionals, who work with children, would only face prison if they fail to report extremely severe cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Professionals will only face imprisonment in extremely severe cases. This means that professionals, who genuinely suspect that a child has suffered significant harm - or is facing actual risks - yet fail to report it without meeting any exemptions for reporting or providing any reasonable justifications, only then will prosecution be initiated," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho warned that scrapping a prison sentence from the bill would lower the effectiveness of the legislation, and society would have to bear the consequences.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan says the SAR government will organise various activities and celebrations in the run-up to the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China to enable youngsters to learn more about their country.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Monday that a "soft sell" approach will be adopted when it comes to promoting patriotism in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan, who chairs the new Working Group on Patriotic Education, said the group is aimed at integrating patriotism into core values of the community, but this will not involve "hard sell" tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patriotism is not something that can be learnt by repeating from memory. Getting to understand is the first step. The ultimate goal is to achieve emotional identification. Sincerely identify with the country, feel proud of the country and then consciously love and protect the country," Chan told reporters after an inaugural meeting of the working group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the group will make reference to the mainland's patriotic education law and come up with appropriate and suitable proposals for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government has no plans to legislate patriotism and will rely on policies and activities to promote it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the government will organise various activities and celebrations in the run-up to October's 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to enable young people to learn more about their country.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday arrived in Riyadh at the start of a new trip to the Middle East aimed at pushing for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and increasing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat will also visit Jordan and Israel on his seventh visit to the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the Israeli assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, Blinken was expected hold new talks with the Saudi leadership on potential normalisation of relations with Israel, a US State Department official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia was considering the step -- which would carry massive significance as the kingdom is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites -- before October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has sought to keep up momentum, dangling the prospect of normalisation to encourage moderation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of Palestinian statehood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will also meet in Riyadh with a number of Gulf Arab and European foreign ministers who are visiting for a World Economic Forum meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will discuss "day-after" plans for reconstruction of post-war Gaza, according to the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans could include funding to rebuild Gaza -- the vast majority of whose people have been displaced -- or support for installing new governance structures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived hours after US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone about ongoing talks to halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce between Israel and Hamas for months, as public pressure mounts for a deal. (AFP)

Four dead after tornadoes strike Oklahoma

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least four people died, including a four-month-old baby, and scores were injured in the state of Oklahoma after dozens of twisters swept the US Southern Plains, while weather alerts on Sunday put more than 7 million Americans under tornado warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Sunday declared a disaster emergency for the state, freeing up more money for first responders and recovery operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Definitely the most damage since I've been governor," Stitt said in Sulphur, one of the hardest-hit communities, as he provided an update on fatalities and damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stitt began his first term as governor in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a call with the Oklahoma governor, President Joe Biden offered the full support of the federal government to help with the recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm warnings for high winds, heavy rain and hail also were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday for more than 47 million people stretching from East Texas north through Illinois and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NWS reported 38 possible twisters hit the area and that the worst of the storms rolled through Central Oklahoma on Saturday into early Sunday morning, spreading into northwest Texas, western Missouri and Kansas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said area hospitals reported 100 injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twisters destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, including the hospital in the town of Marietta, although no injuries were reported there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20,000 customers in the state remained without power as of Sunday evening, according to officials, as emergency personnel worked to clear roads and repair power lines. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will host a meeting of state and territory leaders on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated response towards violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands protested in cities around the country at the weekend to draw attention to the deaths of 27 women so far this year allegedly caused by acts of gender-based violence in a population of 27 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Monday described domestic violence as a “national crisis”, and said the rallies were a call to action for all levels of Australian government to do more to prevent gender-based violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Quite clearly, we need to do more. It’s not enough to just have empathy,” Albanese told Nine Network television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact that... a woman dies every four days on average at the hand of a partner is just a national crisis,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 17 rallies held across Australia over the weekend, with an estimated 15,000 people demonstrating in the city of Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese, his Women’s Minister Katy Gallagher and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth received a hostile response when they attended a rally in the capital Canberra on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters yelled at the government leaders, “we want action” and “do your job.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said there needed to be more focus on perpetrators and prevention of violence. “We need to change the culture, we need to change attitudes, we need to change the legal system,” he told the rally. (AP)

    Art 23 places no limits on press freedom: Paul Lam

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Lam says there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through Article 23 national security legislation. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750995_1_L_20240429111837.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday said national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law places no "extra and unreasonable" restrictions on press freedom and the media can still sharply criticise the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an op-ed published in Ming Pao Daily, the minister said there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration wants the media to pass on accurate, fair and positive information so that officials can lead society to make changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, [officials] need to comprehensively know the ideas, needs and demands from the public [through the press]," Lam wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said so long as the media continue to be impartial, objective and fair in adhering to fundamental professional codes in seeking the truth, there is no need for journalists to be particularly concerned about violating the security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the piece titled "Change and no change", Lam said while the enactment of the homegrown security law last month marked a major change, there are also things that have remained constant such as the values of common law and the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand it improved the legislation on safeguarding national security. It also fully respects fundamental human rights and freedoms on the other," he wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland-based political commentator says relations between China and the United States have improved, but both countries need to work together to resolve conflicts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, was commenting after President Xi Jinping said China and the US should be partners, not rivals, during his meeting with visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, I mean it's better than it was last year at this time. There's at least communication going on. There's more planned communication. It's very important, you have to keep talking especially when you have global tensions like this. There are so many issues that need to be tackled," he said, while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tangen said that, although the Biden administration would most likely continue to see China as a threat, this wasn't the case for business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Business interests are very interested in cooperating and this is a kind of a medium term situation," he said. "You have Elon Musk coming to China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, made an unannounced visit to Beijing, where he was expected to discuss the roll-out of Full Self-Driving software and permission to transfer data overseas, the Reuters news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media said Musk had met Premier Li Qiang, who said Tesla's development in China could be regarded as a successful example of US-China economic and trade cooperation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry won the PGA Tour's Zurich Classic of New Orleans team event on Sunday after a playoff win over Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The USA-French pairing of Ramey and Martin had started the day of foursomes [alternate shot] seven strokes off the lead but a brilliant nine-under par round of 63 saw them fly to the top of the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left the final groups under some pressure to reach the target of 25-under and only McIlroy and Lowry, who played together on the Irish Olympic team and for Europe in the Ryder Cup, were able to get there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Lowry, the 2019 British Open champion, missed a par putt on the 17th, the Irish pair knew they needed to make birdie on the 18th to get into a playoff by tying the clubhouse leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number two McIlroy blasted his drive down the fairway and after Lowry's approach shot left him some work to do, the Northern Irishman produced a wonderful chip that left Lowry with a straightforward five footer for birdie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramey and Trainer had been off the course for three hours and it perhaps showed on the first playoff hole, the 18th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French-born Trainer drove to just behind a fairway bunker but teammate Ramey's 3-wood was hooked far left and after Trainer's chip was short, Ramey missed his putt from off the green, meaning par was the best they could get.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry's approach shot had ended up in a greenside bunker but McIlroy got it safely on to the green and left Lowry with a chance at birdie and victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry has conceded that he has been struggling on the greens of late and he missed the seven-foot putt, leaving Trainer with a putt to extend the playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trainer missed to hand victory to the Irish pairing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was McIlroy's 25th on the PGA Tour while for Lowry it was his third and his first at a PGA Tour sanctioned event since his British Open triumph at Portrush. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz in action during his round of 32 match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750975_1_L_20240429081318.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz passed a "test of fire" to breeze into the Madrid Open last 16 with a straight sets victory over Thiago Seyboth Wild on Sunday, while Aryna Sabalenka staved off teenager Robin Montgomery to progress in three sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Double defending champion Alcaraz came through 6-3, 6-3 and will face last year's runner-up Jan-Lennard Struff in the next round after another impressive showing before adoring fans on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number three Alcaraz, 20, missed a month prior to Madrid with a forearm issue but returned to crush Alexander Shevchenko in the second round and looks in fine shape ahead of the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still wearing a protective sleeve on his right arm, he had far too much for Seyboth Wild, who had ousted 28th seed Lorenzo Musetti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, the 2018 and 2021 Madrid champion, made the last 16 with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Canada's Denis Shapovalov.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrey Rublev came back from 5-0 down in a first set tie-break to beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 [12/10], 6-4 in a tense affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's world number two Sabalenka scraped past plucky 19-year-old Montgomery 6-1, 6-7 [5/7], 6-4 in a two-and-a-half hour tussle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka broke twice for a 5-1 lead against Montgomery, who steeled herself and battled well in the final game, saving three set points before Sabalenka sealed it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number four Elena Rybakina eased to a 6-1, 6-4 win over Egypt's Mayar Sherif to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mirra Andreeva defeated Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 6-1 to return to the last 16 for the second year running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian, who turns 17 on Monday, won 25 points to nine in the second set against the world number seven from the Czech Republic. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 James Harden and Paul George combined for 66 points as the Los Angeles Clippers survived a 31-point Dallas comeback bid on Sunday, leveling their NBA playoff series as New York took a 3-1 lead over Philadelphia behind Jalen Brunson's 47 points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Clippers squared their best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series at 2-2 with a 116-111 triumph in Dallas, but not before the Mavs erased a 31-point deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George scored 26 of his 33 points in the first half to help the Clippers build their big lead despite the injury absence of Kawhi Leonard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harden scored 15 of his 33 in the fourth quarter, when Dallas – led by the star duo of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic – threatened to match the biggest comeback win in NBA playoff history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irving scored 40 points for Dallas, including a driving layup through traffic with 2:14 to play that gave the Mavs their first lead since the first quarter at 104-103.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic delivered a triple-double of 29 points plus 10 rebounds and 10 assists, but in the waning minutes it was George, Harden and the Clippers who came through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Philadelphia, Brunson broke the New York franchise record for points in a playoff game and added 10 assists as the Knicks pushed reigning NBA Most valuable Player Joel Embiid and the Sixers to the brink of elimination in their Eastern Conference series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OG Anunoby had 16 points and 14 rebounds while putting in an impressive defensive effort against Embiid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart grabbed 17 rebounds but scored only four points as, apart from Brunson, the Knicks struggled offensively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indianapolis, the Indiana Pacers drilled 22 three-pointers in a 126-113 victory over the short-handed Milwaukee Bucks to take a 3-1 series lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner hit a playoff career high of seven three-pointers on the way to 29 points and Tyrese Haliburton added 24 points for the Pacers, who had six players in double figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks, with superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by a calf injury, were also without injured Damian Lillard and saw Bobby Portis ejected in the first quarter after a scuffle with Andrew Nembhard after the two tangled under the basket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brook Lopez scored 27 points and Khris Middleton, who tweaked an ankle in the third quarter but stayed in the game, had 25 for the Bucks, who will try to stay alive when they host game five on Tuesday. (AFP)

    Ukraine warns the situation in the east has 'worsened'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's army leader admitted on Sunday that Kyiv's position on the battlefield has worsened after Russian forces captured another village in the east, pressing their advantage in manpower and ammunition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's troops are advancing in the eastern Donetsk region as Kyiv awaits the arrival of much-needed US weapons that it hopes will stabilise the fragile front lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation at the front has worsened," Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a Facebook post on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian troops had "retreated" westwards to new defensive lines in a section of the front that runs past the city of Donetsk, controlled by pro-Russian forces since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has "a significant advantage in forces and means" and had been able to notch up advances amid "heavy fighting," Syrsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some sectors the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas our troops managed to improve the tactical position," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday claimed its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka in the Donetsk region – around 10 kilometres north of Avdiivka, which they seized in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stark assessment of the picture facing Ukrainian troops comes at the end of week of ups and downs for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States finally approved a US$61 billion package of financial aid after months of political wrangling, unlocking much-needed arms for Ukraine's stretched troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on the battlefield Russia chalked up more successes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its troops managed to make rapid advances in a narrow column to the northwest of Avdiivka. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750958_1_L_20240429033030.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and "reviewed ongoing talks" to free hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack on Israel, the White House said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two allies "reviewed ongoing talks to secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza," the White House statement said, as diplomatic efforts intensified to reach a long-sought truce in the war-battered region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from its global allies to reach a ceasefire, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by the Palestinian militant group during the attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Netanyahu "also discussed increases in the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through preparations to open new northern crossings starting this week," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The President stressed the need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination with humanitarian organisations," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With humanitarian agencies sounding ever more dire warnings of a crisis in Gaza, Israel has come under increasing pressure – globally and from the United States specifically – to allow more aid into the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also "reiterated his clear position" on any Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to send troops into Rafah, where more than 1.5 million civilians have taken refuge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden administration, while backing Israel, has repeatedly voiced alarm over the heavy toll on civilians in the Gaza offensive and has pressed Israel to hold off on any Rafah assault. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City overcame relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest 2-0 on Sunday to close to within one point of Premier League leaders Arsenal and keep the destiny of the title race in their own hands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's team had thrown down the gauntlet earlier in the day, fending off a Tottenham fightback to win 3-2, briefly moving four points clear of City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the champions – chasing an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title – saw off a spirited Forest, with goals from Josko Gvardiol and Erling Haaland in either half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest – fighting for their lives – will rue missed chances, including two clear-cut opportunities for Chris Wood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City remain firm favourites to land yet another league title with four games remaining – one more than Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-placed Liverpool are four points behind City having played a game more and are realistically out of the title picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, last month docked four points for breaches of Premier League financial rules, remain just one point outside the relegation zone with three games to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's City, who came into the match on the back of a 30-match unbeaten run in all competitions, did not have it all their own way at the City ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home team had a chance to take a shock lead in the opening seconds but Neco Williams failed to make clean contact from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest looked dangerous when they came forward, with Nathan Ake forced to stretch to keep the ball off the toes of Callum Hudson-Odoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But City took the lead in the 32nd minute when Gvardiol powered home a Kevin De Bruyne corner at the near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, undaunted, continued to test City but Wood missed a glorious chance to level from close range when found by substitute Gonzalo Montiel, getting his feet in a tangle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guardiola made two changes at half-time, bringing on goalkeeper Stefan Ortega for Ederson, who had a shoulder issue, and introducing Mateo Kovacic for Jeremy Doku.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest were quickly out of the traps but Wood again had a moment to forget after Antony Elanga skipped past Kyle Walker into the penalty box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elanga found the New Zealand international but he scuffed his shot and it was blocked easily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City began to take more control as the second period wore on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland, who has been short of his razor-sharp best in recent weeks, came on for Jack Grealish shortly after the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He eased City's nerves minutes later, latching onto a De Bruyne through ball, evading Murillo before finding the net for his 21st Premier League goal of the season. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Meteorologists are warning of the danger of more extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750954_1_L_20240429013412.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An exceptional number of powerful tornadoes have ravaged parts of Oklahoma and nearby Great Plains states in the US, with one small town reportedly hit by two separate tornadoes within hours, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After 78 tornadoes were reported on Friday, mostly in Nebraska and Iowa, a separate weather system on Saturday brought 35 tornado reports from northern Texas to Missouri, the National Weather Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least two people, including a four-month-old child, died in the Oklahoma town of Holdenville, according to multiple reports in state and local media, though crews on Sunday were still sifting through the mounds of rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storms dumped up to 18 centimetres of rain in some places within hours, and meteorologists warned of a continuing danger of extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos and images posted on social media showed scores of building flattened in the small town of Sulphur, in south-central Oklahoma, with vehicles smashed or overturned and trees stripped of branches and leaves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postal trucks in Sulphur rested precariously atop the nearly unrecognisable wreckage of buildings, one video showed. Rescue crews went house to house and vehicle to vehicle in search of victims or survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "DO NOT COME TO SULPHUR UNLESS YOU ARE A FIRST RESPONDER!!!" the Murray County sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tornado that struck Ardmore, Oklahoma tossed debris up to 6,100 metres high, the Washington Post reported. Then two other tornadoes came close to the town in the ensuing two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt declared a 30-day state of emergency to expedite aid to 12 of the hardest-hit counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50,000 homes in Texas and more than 30,000 in Oklahoma were without power as of late Sunday morning, the poweroutage.us website reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The region is known for the frequency and power of the tornadoes that rumble through every spring. But having separate major outbreaks in succeeding days is exceedingly rare, meteorologists said. (AFP)

 Diplomatic efforts intensified on Sunday to reach a long sought-after truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as Hamas said it would travel to mediator Egypt to deliver its response to Israel's latest proposal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire from its global allies, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by Hamas during their October 7 attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas delegation will arrive in Egypt on Monday to deliver the group's response to Israel's new hostage and truce counterproposal, a senior official of the militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire – a condition that Israel has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the Axios news website, citing two Israeli officials, reported that Israel's latest proposal includes a willingness to discuss the "restoration of sustainable calm" in Gaza after hostages are released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first time in the nearly seven-month war that Israeli leaders have suggested they are open to discussing an end to the war, Axios said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas source close to the negotiations said that the group "is open to discussing the new proposal positively."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The source added that the group is "keen to reach an agreement that guarantees a permanent ceasefire, the free return of displaced people, an acceptable deal for (prisoner) exchange and ensuring an end to the siege" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new hopes of a potential truce came as world leaders and humanitarian groups warned that a looming Israeli invasion of the southernmost city of Rafah would lead to massive civilian causalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas appealed to the US to stop Israel from invading Rafah, which he said would be "the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal held on for a pulsating 3-2 win over arch rivals Tottenham in the north London derby to keep their grip on top spot in the Premier League on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bidding to stay one step ahead of Manchester City in the title race, Mikel Arteta's side silenced the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with a three-goal blast before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's own goal put Arsenal ahead before Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz netted to leave Arsenal in complete control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero and Son Heung-min struck for Tottenham after the interval to set up a nervous finish, but Arsenal clung on by their finger tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal sit four points clear of second placed City, who face struggling Nottingham Forest later on Sunday in the first of two games in hand over the Gunners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last five matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Arsenal are doing all they can to make Pep Guardiola's team sweat as they try to make amends for blowing an eight-point lead in last season's title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the despair of a damaging home defeat against Aston Villa and a Champions League quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich, the Gunners have bounced back impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aware they have little margin for error with City chasing them, Arteta had called on his players to show their hunger for success and they responded to his challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thrashing old foes Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday was merely the appetiser ahead of the main course Arsenal served up for 3,000 of their jubilant fans packed into one corner of the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal famously won the league twice at Tottenham's old White Hart Lane stadium, in 1971 and 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gunners could not clinch silverware on enemy territory this time, but their fifth win in the last seven north London derbies kept them in the hunt to win the title for the first time in 20 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat was a bitter blow for fifth-placed Tottenham, who are seven points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa with two games in hand to keep alive their fading hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing for the first time since a 4-0 defeat at Newcastle 15 days ago, Tottenham should have been fresher than an Arsenal team in action four times over that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sunday's other early kick-off, Bournemouth beat Brighton 3-0 through goals from Marcos Senesi, Enes Unai and Justin Kluivert. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers and families of pupils at Rosaryhill Secondary School say students are left on their own after the school decides to cease operations early. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750934_1_L_20240428184716.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers and families of pupils at an aided Catholic school in Wan Chai on Sunday accused education officials of inaction over the institution's decision to shut earlier than it had originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rosaryhill Secondary School on Stubbs Road first announced last September that it would cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government-aided school later said it would arrange for Form One to Five pupils to transfer to Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No 2 this September. Rosaryhill Kindergarten and Rosaryhill (Primary) School, meanwhile, will be combined with Dalton School Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brother of a Form Five pupil – a former Rosaryhill student himself – expressed concerns about his sister's education at her new school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Education Bureau was relatively passive and not willing to help us on this issue... Pupils are not as simple as assets that you could transfer to others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother of a Form Three student condemned the Education Bureau for not having met parents over the issue, which she said weighed heavily on her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee legislator Doreen Kong urged the administration to address the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We don't want this to happen again. The [Education Bureau] must explain to the public what the principles are and what the policies of the government are in handling all these similar situations,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to come out to help the students and to ensure that there is a smooth transition for all the students, especially to overcome their psychological distress."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said he would file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I find that the school is not professional enough to take care of the students. And the administrative side is also not totally concerned about the rights and interests of students and parents... I want to clarify, during the process, what role did the administration play," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said he would also talk to authorities on pushing back the school’s shutdown, to let senior secondary pupils finish their studies there.

 Police on Sunday arrested a mother on suspicion of leaving her three children at home alone in Tung Chung.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they received a call from her son, 9, shortly after 10am, saying his mother "went downstairs" from the flat at Yat Tung Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said when they arrived at the scene, they found his brother, 2, and sister, 6, were also there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The children were not hurt.
  <br/>

    Govt mulls manhole training for all sewer workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bernadette Linn says the government may require drainage cleaners who don't need to enter manholes to go through manhole training. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750919_1_L_20240428170632.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials want to step up training of sewer workers to prevent incidents involving manholes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her comments came after the death of two workers last week at a manhole in Sha Tin, the same site where two others died nearly two decades ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Linn said the contracts state that workers should only operate on the ground, and if relevant works require them to enter the manhole, only qualified personnel are allowed and risk assessment must be conducted beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said officials are looking into adding clauses to future contracts, requiring workers who only conduct cleaning on the ground to go through training as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you do enter manholes [in future], you have to inform the Drainage Services Department beforehand and receive its approval," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're considering making it mandatory for those doing the cleaning on the ground to also go through manhole training. This is to raise their awareness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Linn said officials are considering whether to immediately prosecute homeowners found to have illegal structures, rather than issuing orders for removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has been reviewing the Buildings Ordinance after cases of unauthorised structures were reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development secretary said the administration is studying whether the prosecution process can be streamlined, the prosecution threshold lowered and relevant fines raised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that a clause in the current legislation stipulates harsher penalties for offenders who "knowingly" violate the law. Linn said officials want to remove such wording, which she said allows homeowners to claim they were not aware of the illegal structures and that the problem had already existed before they bought the place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said officials will make sure the relevant amendments – to be put forward in the final quarter of this year – will be reasonable.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Kevin Yeung said a pyrotechnic display scheduled for May 1 may be cancelled because of bad weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show, hosted by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, is set to be held across Victoria Harbour to kick off a campaign of regular fireworks displays aimed at boosting tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But according to the Observatory's forecast, the weather on Labour Day is expected to be cloudy with showers and squally thunderstorms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for culture, sports and tourism on Sunday said authorities could wait until Wednesday to decide whether the show would be held as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We shall keep an eye on the weather and make announcements as early as possible. It may not be until the afternoon of May 1 that we can officially say whether the display will be affected," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that tourists coming to Hong Kong will be prepared mentally that some performances may not be possible due to the rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the administration is prepared for the arrival of visitors in the coming week, adding that hotel bookings for the Golden Week holiday have been strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Golden Week holiday will help boost businesses in Hong Kong. Of course, I hope if the weather is good, it will be more convenient for those visiting Hong Kong," he said.

    Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel

Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750907_1_L_20240428151400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

    Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU

Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750894_1_L_20240428133152.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists have defended the need for the city to have a minimum wage and called for "reasonable and objective" discussion on the issue, after a lawmaker suggested scrapping the basic hourly rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) said the statutory minimum wage, which is currently at HK$40, is essential to protecting employees, in response to comments by Liberal Party legislator Tommy Cheung of the catering sector that the minimum wage could hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, FTU chairman Kingsley Wong said having a minimum wage in place is a common practice worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main purpose of the minimum wage is to be a policy safety net, to ensure grassroots or the most disadvantaged local workers receive appropriate protection," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the issue of the minimum wage, we should be reasonable and objective. Around the world, many countries and regions in the West and Asia have a minimum wage, so the minimum wage must be an appropriate measure then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also renewed calls for the statutory minimum wage to be reviewed annually, instead of once every two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of a recent string of deadly industrial accidents, the FTU called on various stakeholders such as employers, workers, architects and developers to do their part to ensure occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demands by the federation ahead of this year's Labour Day included priority be given to local labour, better protection for employees who have to stay online after office hours – also known as “invisible overtime” – and standardised contracts of delivery platform workers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.

    'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'
   </title>

'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750892_1_L_20240428114518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Concern groups on Sunday said proposed jail sentences for people who fail to report child abuse should be kept in place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill currently making it way through the Legislative Council, professionals such as social workers, teachers and doctors are required to report suspected cases of serious child abuse, and those who fail to comply face a maximum penalty of a three-month prison term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, calling it too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Wong from the Commission on Children – a government advisory body on child affairs – said the proposed three-month sentence is reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ultimate objective is to protect the children. And, if we set up the penalty level, which is not high enough, the impact is not great, right?" he told reporters after speaking on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why we think that the three-month imprisonment, together with the HK$50,000 fine, is a reasonable threshold, reasonable level of penalty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donna Wong, director of Against Child Abuse, said the proposed penalty should not be lowered, citing the 1,457 child abuse cases reported last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lowering the penalty will hinder the development of the mandatory reporting of the trial bill, because it will lower the effectiveness of the bill and hinder the deterrence effect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said he believes a balance could be struck between bringing in a deterrent mechanism against the non-reporting of child abuse and addressing concerns of professionals who may be affected by the proposed law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the most important thing is we need deterrence against serious cases. But if the cases are minor, as often is the case, we think we can find a package that is acceptable to both the relevant sectors and those advocating for child protection," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Legco bills committee is scrutinising the proposed legislation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong epee fencer Cedric Ho booked his maiden ticket to the Olympics in dramatic fashion, winning the final qualifying tournament for the Paris Games with victories by a single point in both the semi-final and final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ho, the SAR's top-rated fencer and ranked 52 in the world, defeated Iranian Mohammed Esmaeili 15-14 in the semi-final of the Asia-Oceania zonal qualifiers held in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old then won the final bout 9-8 against Uzbekistan's Javokhirbek Nurmatov to book his trip to Paris this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR has now qualified for 30 events in the upcoming Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Things didn't go as well for Ho's teammate, sabre fencer Low Ho-tin, whose hope for Paris was dashed after he suffered a 15-6 semi-final defeat at the hands of China's Shen Chenpeng, who went on to win the qualifier.

    Nearly 200 detained in US campus protests

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pro-Palestinian protesters stand in front of a police barricade after officers raid an encampment at Northeastern University in Boston. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750889_2_L_20240428112831.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police detained nearly 200 people at three US universities on Saturday as they cleared pro-Palestinian encampments, in the latest campus clashes triggered by protests over Israel's war against Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the East Coast, police in Boston detained about 100 people while clearing a protest camp at Northeastern University, with social media posts showing security forces in riot gear and officers loading tents onto the back of a truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action was taken after some protesters resorted to "virulent anti-Semitic slurs, including 'Kill the Jews,'" Northeastern University said in a statement on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the opposite side of the country, Arizona State University police arrested 69 people for trespassing after the group set up an "unauthorised encampment" on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona State officials said a protest group – "most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff" – had set up a camp on Friday and then ignored repeated orders to disperse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in the US heartland, police at Indiana University arrested 23 people as they cleared a campus protest camp, the Indiana Daily Student newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police with shields, batons and other riot gear broke through a line of protesters who had linked arms, tackling those who did not move, the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campus activists are calling for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas, as well as for colleges to sever ties with the country and with companies they say profit from the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protests have posed a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have carried out large-scale arrests at universities in recent days, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse demonstrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on X, Northeastern said the area on campus where the protests were held was now "fully secured" and "all campus operations have returned to normal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it made the move after "what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that detained individuals who produced a valid school ID have been released and will face disciplinary proceedings, not legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested," the school said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of students remained encamped on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania, despite the college president ordering disbandment after what he said were "credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York, where the protests originated, was relatively calm. Officials there announced on Friday that they would not be calling police back to campus after more than 100 people were arrested last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community," school leaders said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada saw its first campus protest camp spring up on Saturday at McGill University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school in Montreal said such encampments, which are not permitted, increase "the potential for escalation and confrontation, as we have seen at some colleges throughout the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants also took roughly 250 people hostage. Israel estimates 129 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,388 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An ammunition explosion at a base in southwestern Cambodia killed 20 soldiers and wounded several others, Prime Minister Hun Manet said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet said in a Facebook post that he was “deeply shocked” when he received the news of the blast on Saturday afternoon at the base in Kampong Speu province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn't immediately clear what caused it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images from the scene showed several badly damaged buildings still smoldering, at least one with its roof blown off, and soldiers receiving treatment in a hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other photos showed houses with holes in their roofs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four buildings – three for storage and one work facility – were destroyed and several military vehicles damaged, Colonel Youeng Sokhon, an army officer at the site, said in a brief report to army chief General Mao Sophan, posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that 25 villagers' homes were damaged as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kiripost, an online English language news service, quoted a nearby resident as saying a major explosion occurred at about 2.30pm, followed by smaller blasts for another hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pheng Kimneang was quoted as saying the windows of a factory nearby were shattered, and homes as far as a kilometre (a half-mile) away suffered minor damage. Photos of the base show it in a large field, apparently with no civilian structures close by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet offered condolences to the soldiers’ families and promised the government would pay for their funerals and provide compensation both to those killed and those wounded. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's fading Premier League title hopes were dealt a near-fatal blow on Saturday as West Ham rescued a draw against Jurgen Klopp's men while Sheffield United dropped through the relegation trap door.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a dramatic day in the top-flight, Aston Villa's top four challenge was dented by a 2-2 draw against Chelsea, whose furious manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed VAR has "damaged the Premier League" after his side had a late goal controversially disallowed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester United's push for Europe was held up by Burnley in a 1-1 stalemate and Everton secured their top-flight status with a 1-0 win at home to Brentford.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp's glittering reign at Anfield appears to be ending on a flat note after they dropped points for the fourth time in five league games at the London Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool would have moved level on points with leaders Arsenal with a victory at West Ham, at least temporarily, but they failed to make the most of their chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gunners are on 77 points, two clear of Liverpool with a game in hand, while defending champions Manchester City have 76 points with two games in hand on the Reds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarrod Bowen put West Ham ahead shortly before half time but Liverpool looked a different side in the second period, equalising through Andy Robertson before an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the home side levelled in the 77th minute when Bowen wriggled free down the right and lifted a cross towards Michail Antonio, who headed home to make it 2-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp attempted to play down a touchline spat with Mohamed Salah, who was left out of the starting line-up, but the Egypt forward fanned the flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's going to be a fire today if I speak," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's City, who play relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest on Sunday, are hot favourites to secure an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title while Arsenal face a tough away day at Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's 5-1 win against basement club Sheffield United strengthened their push for European football next season but sent Chris Wilder's team down to the Championship after just 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anel Ahmedhodzic gave the visitors an early lead at St James' Park but Alexander Isak scored twice as the home side roared back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have not been good enough," Wilder told the BBC. "The league has been too powerful for us right the way through the season."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle remain in seventh place but are just one point behind Manchester United, who conceded a late penalty in a 1-1 draw against Burnley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazilian winger Antony scored his first Premier League goal of the season but Zeki Amdouni levelled from the spot in the 87th minute, giving Burnley hope they can stay up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said his team, who have a nasty habit of throwing away leads, "gave it away".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourth placed Villa blew a two-goal lead against Chelsea after Marc Cucurella's fourth minute own goal and Morgan Rogers' 42nd minute strike had put the hosts in control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noni Madueke got one back in the 62nd minute and Conor Gallagher curled in the 81st minute equaliser for Chelsea, who felt aggrieved that a stoppage-time Axel Disasi header was disallowed for a foul by Benoit Badiashile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me it has damaged a little bit the Premier League and English football. If we want to be the best league in the world it should be protecting the spectacle and the decision," Pochettino said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The referee is unbelievable and it's ridiculous. It is difficult to accept."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of people protested in Australian cities on Saturday, demanding more be done to stop violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At events in Sydney and Adelaide, demonstrators carried banners saying "no excuse for abuse" and asked the government to step in and prevent violence that has claimed dozens of lives already this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese backed the protests and vowed to march at further events planned for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A woman has been killed every four days so far this year," he posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments need to do better, men need to step up and as a society, we must do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also took part in a demonstration in Sydney, and said change was desperately needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violence against women has come to the fore in Australia after a spate of high-profile murder cases and a knife attack on a Sydney mall that left five women dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, police arrested former "Home and Away" actor Orpheus Pledger, after he allegedly failed to appear in court to face charges of assaulting a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers in the advocacy group What Were You Wearing have called three days of protests from Friday to Sunday, saying "29 Women have been killed to men's violence since the start of 2024. Enough is enough." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Saturday that they had arrested a truck driver after an accident at about 4pm in which six people were injured.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said a 68-year-old man was driving a minibus along Kam Sheung Road towards Yuen Long, when it was hit by a truck driven by a 56-year-old man.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minibus hit a lamp post and flipped on to its side, and the police said the truck didn't stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the truck driver failed an alcohol test, and was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, drunk driving, reckless driving after a traffic accident and failure to report a traffic accident.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Drivers in mainland China who trade in an old car for a newer model are eligible for a subsidy of up to 10,000 yuan (HK$10,800), the commerce ministry has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China is the world's biggest market for cars, and the most competitive in the electric vehicle sector, with more than 100 homegrown companies racing to make the clean car of the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To boost demand, Beijing is offering the subsidy to drivers who trade in an electric or hybrid vehicle registered before 2018, or a gasoline-powered car that doesn't meet certain national emissions standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who replace a vehicle purchased after 2018 will be eligible for a subsidy of 7,000 yuan, the commerce ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The measure, in force until the end of the year, applies to all purchases of new electric or hybrid vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its announcement coincides with the China Auto Show, where Chinese brands are stealing the show from foreign manufacturers struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Min Hee-jin, CEO of HYBE's sub-label Ador, attends a press conference in Seoul. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750837_1_L_20240427181538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The creative director behind the girl band NewJeans has found online fame after a tearful, profanity-laced news conference in which she slammed some of K-pop's most powerful executives.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HYBE, the South Korean agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, filed a legal complaint on Thursday against Min Hee-jin, the head of its powerhouse subsidiary label ADOR, for breach of trust in business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed an announcement three days earlier that it had launched an audit of ADOR and demanded that Min resign. HYBE's share price fell close to 10 percent after the audit was announced and closed on Friday down 4.95 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, 44, hit back in a news conference on Thursday that drew empathy online from young working men and women who compared her story with their own experiences with unreasonable and jealous bosses who either took credit for their work or failed to acknowledge it fairly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, however, said she had acted inappropriately and unprofessionally by occasionally lapsing into profanity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She denied HYBE's accusations and claimed it was trying to dismiss her unfairly after she accused another of its subsidiaries, BELIFT LAB, of imitating NewJeans with a girl group of its own called ILLIT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, speaking off the cuff and often breaking down in tears, candidly shared her frustrations for more than two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She referred to HYBE's leaders, including chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the man behind BTS, as "gaejeossi", which translates roughly to a "middle-aged or old male fool".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel betrayed by HYBE... they used me until I was no longer of use to them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The live-streamed event, during which even her lawyers appeared embarrassed, had millions of views and drew an explosive public response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parody YouTube video seen by 2.5 million viewers combined a clip of Min speaking passionately with hip-hop music. The t-shirt and baseball cap she was wearing sold out on several online platforms and many others said they had suffered similar experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women who have truly worked (hard) and experienced being undermined by men, along with the dirty side of office politics, could never speak ill of Min Hee-jin," a South Korean woman said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Moon-won, a culture critic who watched the news conference, said Min sidestepped the real allegations against her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No figure as influential as Min in the entertainment industry has ever used curse words during an official press conference, people have really never seen anything like it, so this obviously has attracted enormous attention," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As one of few successful women producers in the industry, Min has been recognised for her arresting visual imagery on numerous K-pop hits, including Girls' Generation's "Gee" and EXO's "Growl".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min said HYBE chairman Bang never congratulated her on NewJeans' debut and that the parent company had given promotional priority to another of its K-pop groups, Le Sserafim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HYBE rejected Min's accusations and urged her again to resign and stop discussing NewJeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts criticised both Min and HYBE over a scandal that has gripped much of South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  K-pop columnist Isak Choi said those involved showed "incompetence and vulgarity by not hesitating to publicly display infighting".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just because Min criticised HYBE's leadership, "it doesn't mean she is free from the rotten issues of this industry", Choi wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She cannot become the underdog simply because she is fighting with the management, especially after having gained astronomical benefits from within it." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dane Cheng says it's unrealistic for tourist numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels. Photo: Screenshot of the HOY TV programme" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750821_1_L_20240427161255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Saturday said he thinks major events like the Victoria Harbour firework and drone displays will still be a big draw for mainland visitors during the Golden Week holiday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of measures to prepare for the influx of visitors, such as allowing cross-border shuttle buses to increase service frequency and extending the operating hours of the last East Rail Line train to Lo Wu on some days. The MTR also said it would increase train services on seven rail lines, adding a total of 540 train trips during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland's Golden Week break runs between May 1 and May 5.

Police Commissioner praises Mong Kok CCTV cameras

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok this month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.

    Treasury chief says CSRC measures can be a boon for HK

Treasury chief says CSRC measures can be a boon for HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.

 Hamas said it was studying on Saturday the latest Israeli counter proposal regarding a potential ceasefire in Gaza, a day after a delegation from mediator Egypt reportedly arrived in Israel in a bid to jump-start stalled negotiations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The signs of fresh truce talks came alongside ongoing Israeli preparations for a military push into Gaza's southern city of Rafah and as spillover from the war led to continued attacks across the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, the Hamas movement received the official Zionist occupation response to the movement's position, which was delivered to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators on April 13," Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas's political arm in Gaza, said in a brief statement early Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement will study this proposal, and upon completion of its study, it will submit its response."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas had previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire, something rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been unsuccessfully trying to seal a new truce deal in Gaza ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Israeli media outlets, citing unnamed officials, said Israel's war cabinet had discussed a new plan for a truce and hostage release ahead of the Egyptian delegation's visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been "noticeable progress in bringing the views of the Egyptian and Israeli delegations closer", said Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza was also on the agenda for an international summit set to kick off in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Economic Forum special meeting, scheduled to begin in Riyadh on Sunday, will include a Gaza-focused session on Monday set to feature newly appointed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions with European, American and regional counterparts on Gaza and the regional situation are planned in Riyadh," a diplomatic source said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in besieged Gaza reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight into Saturday around Rafah, the last urban centre Israeli ground forces have yet to enter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans for an Israeli incursion into the city, which military leaders say is necessary to uproot Hamas battalions, have sparked opposition among the international community due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians seeking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP on Thursday that such an operation "will undoubtedly threaten the negotiations" and show "that Israel is interested in continuing the war".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,170 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,356 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel estimates that 129 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. (AFP)

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.

    Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister

Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750786_2_L_20240427135328.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.

    Non-plastic prices to fall as use increases: minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan (right) also said authorities must find reliable alternatives before expanding a ban on single-use plastics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750777_1_L_20240427080634.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment chief Tse Chin-wan has stressed that a ban on single-use plastics is not meant to trouble people, saying prices for alternatives will go down further when they become more common.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect on April 22, prohibiting the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse told RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme, which was broadcast on Saturday, that the policy is not intended to make people's lives more difficult but to regulate plastics at source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those disposable tableware, if you switch to the alternatives, the difference is actually very small, usually one or two cents to a maximum of 50 cents for the whole package. Therefore, it's not very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that as more and more will be used in society, the price will go down further. People's behaviour will drive the development of the alternatives, as well as drive down the price of those alternatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said authorities must find reliable substitutes before expanding the scope of scheme, as he ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic products because their use is too widespread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not going to ban the use of all plastics at once. That is not possible... We start with those which we already have readily available and mature alternatives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the postponed municipal solid waste charging scheme, the environment minister said there are proven effects of the policy in Seoul, where the amount to garbage produced was cut by 60 to 70 percent in about five to 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government pushed back the implementation of the waste charging to August, while it held trials for the scheme at more than a dozen premises this month.
