<div class="itemFullText">
 A documentary produced jointly by China Media Group (CMG) and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) will showcase the unique charm of Hong Kong's culinary culture to the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a launch ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the documentary "Taste of Hong Kong" is an important milestone as it is the first joint production of the two broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said CMG's cooperation with RTHK has supported the SAR in various ways, including the donation of a number of high-quality programmes for RTHK for broadcast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cooperation has not only further enhanced Hong Kong people's understanding of the country, but also promoted the city's integration into the country's overall development, while promoting Chinese culture to the international community, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Wang Xiaozhen, Vice President of CMG, said the group has fulfilled its duties and mission as part of state media by working closely with the Hong Kong government to tell the city's story, promote quality development and showcase the charm of Chinese culture. He said it has achieved a number of fruitful results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said he hoped the documentary will encourage more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that RTHK will play an active role by working closely with mainland broadcast media, while acting as a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia’s anti-graft court sentenced a former agriculture minister to 10 years in prison on Thursday after finding him guilty of corruption-related extortion, abuse of power and bribery involving ministry contracts with private vendors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case has tarnished President Joko Widodo’s credibility in fighting corruption. Five other members of Widodo’s cabinet had been sentenced to prison terms in corruption cases, casting a shadow over his efforts to clean up government before his term ends in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court in the capital, Jakarta, ruled that the former cabinet minister, Syahrul Yasin Limpo, was guilty of abusing his power by enriching himself and other officials. It also ordered him to pay a 300 million rupiah fine, and said he would be subject to another four months’ imprisonment if he fails to pay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The defendant has legally and convincingly been proven guilty of corruption,” presiding Judge Rianto Adam Pontoh said. “He wasn’t a good example as a public official, what he has done is counter the government’s efforts to fight corruption and enriched himself by corruption."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Limpo was arrested last October by the Corruption Eradication Commission, known as the KPK. He has denied wrongdoing. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A new survey showed that nursing and education were the most popular subject choices among this year's DSE candidates. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761194_1_20240711171436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ninety percent of this year’s DSE candidates hoped to continue their education in Hong Kong, according to a survey conducted by the Quality People Resources Limited between November and January this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It polled 3,236 DSE takers from 41 secondary schools across Hong Kong, aiming to examine students’ preferences in continuing education and taking up employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s director Edward Chan on Thursday said students hoped to stay in the city mostly due to convenience and the fact that they view Hong Kong as their home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For local students, convenience, parent’s expectations, or scholarship, sponsorship, or Hong Kong is their home…[these are why they would prefer to stay in Hong Kong],” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four percent of candidates hoped to continue their education on the mainland, and six percent overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese University and Polytechnic University were the most popular choices among students, with 22.4 percent and 16.4 percent of students hoping to be admitted respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nursing was the most desirable subject among students at 13.5 percent, followed by education at 12.44 percent and psychology at 12.41 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This echoes with the most preferred job industry among students, with education at 16.4 percent and nursing at 13.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that students tend to select subjects according to their DSE results and personal interests, followed by industry trends related to their preferred majors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study also saw an increase in preference in selecting Hong Kong as the future working location for graduates, with a rise from 76 percent last year to 81 percent this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that personal interests, at 58.9 percent of candidates, remained the top priority among students this year when choosing their career, followed by salary and benefits at 54.9 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The living cost in Hong Kong is very high. Students can see the high cost of rent, transport and food, therefore they will consider this first [when choosing their subjects]. Therefore students are indoctrinated with the thought that they will need to acquire a certain salary level to live in Hong Kong,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said it would consider the increase of university tuition fees starting from the 2025/26 academic year for their survey next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50,800 DSE candidates will receive their exam results next Wednesday.

    Police to use Chinese pistols instead of US revolvers
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they were replacing US-made revolvers with pistols manufactured on the mainland to meet their operational needs, with officers expected to use the new handguns as soon as July 25.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two Chinese-made pistols, CF98-A and CS/LP5, will replace existing service revolvers from the US firm Smith & Wesson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of officers to receive training includes those from the tactical unit, emergency unit, quick reaction force and crime wing headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our established procurement procedures. To review the police uniform, accoutrement, as well as equipment, is a regular [task] that the police force has been doing," said superintendent Ko Cheuk-hang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To choose a good equipment we rely on a couple of very important principles, first of all the effectiveness and the long-term sustainability. And apart of this major principle, we need to make sure all these equipment could serve the purpose as well as meet our weapon handling standard requirement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the new pistol is equipped with a manual safety catch and can be reloaded faster compared with the existing revolvers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko added the force would be trained to use the new handguns in phases, but did not comment on the timeline for a full transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Vickers, the CEO of risk consultancy Steve Vickers and Associates, told RTHK that the move to replace the handguns was not unexpected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not surprising given that the old Smith & Wesson revolvers are no longer being manufactured, and it's actually quite difficult to get spare parts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously the US-China relations are pretty poor. There have already been restrictions on both the Americans and the EU countries supplying weapons to the Hong Kong police. So it made sense to, for both historical reasons and practical reasons and political reasons, to move to a PRC-manufactured firearm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former senior police officer added that the transition could take years, depending on the delivery and training schedules.

    Legco passes child abuse reporting law
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco passes child abuse reporting law" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761185_1_20240711163026.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will work on finding additional care places for abused children, as more cases are expected to come to light in the city thanks to a new law passed by Legco on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill sets out how 25 types of professionals, including doctors, social workers and teachers, will face a maximum punishment of three months in prison and a HK$50,000 fine if they fail to tell the authorities when they suspect a child is suffering physical, psychological or sexual abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill was introduced last year following a series of abuse scandals which sparked calls for more protection for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventy-nine lawmakers voted in favour of the new law, with no opposing votes and one abstention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the legislation will come into effect 18 months after it is gazetted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're going to make use of the coming 18 months to make sure that everything is ready so that by the time the legislation comes into effect, all the professions who are required under the law to make mandatory reporting will get the necessary training," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're also at the same time putting in place additional facilities and homes to cater for the increasing cases of reporting. And also, we're going to step up our efforts in terms of promotion and publicity, and make sure that we all work together for the welfare and betterment of our children.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Thursday's debate on the bill, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien proposed a higher maximum punishment of one year in prison for those who fail to report abuse suspicions, saying the three-month term doesn't reflect the seriousness of such an offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Did you ask the children’s thoughts? Did you only ask the professionals’ thoughts? We have one million children in Hong Kong. I think we won’t have one million professionals,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tien also argued that the courts rarely hand out the maximum sentence possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said the penalty level is the same as for other mandatory reporting laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These include the reporting of drug trafficking, terrorism, and organised crime. The government believes the deterrent effect of the penalty is already sufficient and appropriate to the crimes involved,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, meanwhile, lauded the government for adding more exemptions and immunity clauses in the bill, as well as for forming consultant groups to create a “report manual”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said these moves had addressed concerns raised by professionals regarding the bill.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A rower who waded deep into the Atlantic Ocean has said he had a close encounter with more than 1,000 whales, which swam alongside him for hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  UK-based Tom Waddington, who was 100 nautical miles (185km) off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, also captured the stunning encounter on Sunday on video as he rowed solo to raise money for charity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The images he captured showed the whales swimming around his boat, rocking it as they passed. He expressed both awe and worry during the breathtaking moment at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I love it, but I'm scared they're going to hit my rudder. They're so close, I can hear them. They're blowing bubbles," he said in the video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't believe it. It's an amazing sight, but also so scary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rower on his Instagram said he tried to row away from the huge pod of whales, but they followed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, they swam alongside him for two hours and eventually left him alone, he said, adding he was safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mr Waddington is undertaking a 2,000 nautical miles journey to raise funds for mental health. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick on Thursday called on the government to limit the number of online ride-hailing platforms available in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature earlier this week, officials said they plan to regulate online ride-hailing services through a licensing system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Yick said the authorities should issue a licence to only one or two platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a number of these online car-hailing platforms available in Hong Kong. Now if you look around the other cities in the world, some of them have already controlled the number of these kinds of platforms available for the citizens to use," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of having a limited number of platforms, because the possibility of matching the services will be much better than if you split into a multi-number of these kinds of platforms. I think this is a very simple concept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yick also said that the drivers of private vehicles offering ride-hailing services through such platforms should obtain a licence, otherwise they and their passengers would not be covered by insurance.

    High-potential swimmers won't be hindered: Ronnie Wong

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, Ronnie Wong, on Thursday said the association would give special consideration to high-potential young swimmers to participate in races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came amid calls to revise the rules for competition qualifications over accusations that some swimmers had been discriminated against due to the club they belonged to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media reported that a nine-year-old was denied entry to compete at the 2024 open championships in Hong Kong due to the ranking of his swimming club, despite the swimmer meeting the qualifying time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Wong said the association would not hinder swimmers with potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to take care of a lot of clubs. Under some special circumstances if the swimmers are really outstanding, but the clubs they belong to are not qualified for open race, we will consider allowing the swimmers to compete. But this is only on an individual consideration," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told the same radio programme that the association should remove higher-ranked clubs, that have been inactive for two or three years, from affiliation, allowing lower-ranked clubs to move up and take their place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because according to the current rules of the swimming association, if a club does not cancel its affiliation, there will be no room for lower-ranked clubs to advance. If there are clubs which don't have any activity, and remain in the same position, there is no chance for lower-ranked clubs to advance," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said the association should enhance transparency by disclosing the number of inactive clubs and ensure fair handling of club rankings.

    China warns Nato against 'provoking confrontation'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the European Union said Nato should do more to contribute to world peace and stability. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761137_1_20240711110240.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday warned Nato against "provoking confrontation" over its ties with Russia, after the alliance accused it of playing a key role in helping Moscow's assault on Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said a declaration from Nato leaders from their Washington summit was full of "belligerent rhetoric" and the China-related content has provocations and lies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nato statement claimed that China had "become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine", and that Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed Beijing's "so-called 'no limits' partnership" and "large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base" were of "profound concern".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, a spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the European Union said: "Nato should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is known to all that China is not the creator [of] the Ukraine crisis. China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The declaration of the Nato summit in Washington is full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing put forward a 12-point paper more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war, but did not get into specifics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also repeatedly hit out at Nato criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Asia-Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top officials of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, in attendance at Nato, have forged stronger ties with the security alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said: "We firmly oppose Nato acting beyond its characterisation as a regional defensive alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry, and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uruguay's Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia went down to 10 men just before half-time when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. (Reuters)

    England overcome Netherlands to advance to Euro final

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ollie Watkins struck a stunning injury-time winner as England beat the Netherlands 2-1 on Wednesday to set up a Euro 2024 final showdown with Spain in Berlin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an incredible finish to an evening that began badly for England, as Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in the semi-final in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, England were soon level through a Harry Kane penalty following a contentious VAR call by German referee Felix Zwayer, and the match looked set for extra time until Watkins struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On for Kane, Watkins received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer with his back to goal in the first minute of stoppage time, turned and fired low into the far corner to leave the Netherlands bewildered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm lost for words really," said Watkins, the Aston Villa striker. "I don't think I've hit a ball that sweet before, and obviously in such a special moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has rarely been a convincing campaign from Gareth Southgate's England side, but they are through to their second consecutive European Championship final as they dream of finally winning a first major trophy since 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To do that they will surely have to perform better than at any point so far in Germany as they face an outstanding Spain team, who beat France 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands had been hoping to repeat their triumph at the last Euros in Germany, in 1988, but their current side lacks anyone with the star quality of Marco van Basten or Ruud Gullit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A victory for them would have seen this Euros conclude with the same final as the 2010 World Cup. Instead they now go home. (AFP)

    Clooney urges Biden to end 2024 bid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden is hosting the Nato summit in Washington this week. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761092_1_20240711014558.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden suffered a stunning blow on Wednesday when actor and leading Democratic supporter George Clooney urged him to drop his reelection bid, while party heavyweight Nancy Pelosi declined to back his candidacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I love Joe Biden," Clooney, who hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden just last month, wrote in the New York Times. "But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's bid for a second term in the White House has been under severe pressure since the debate, in which he slurred his words and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to turn the page took a leap backwards with the interventions of Pelosi and Clooney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run," she told MSNBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which the US president is hosting this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the way to the summit on Wednesday, Biden dropped in on US union leaders in a further bid to shore up backing for his reelection bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's appearances at the Nato gathering are being closely watched as he tries to reassure allies of his continued ability to lead as the alliance backs Ukraine's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection. A handful of senators have also expressed concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Tuesday, Colorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot – and perhaps cause congressional Democrats to lose as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House," Bennet told CNN, adding he believes the White House "has done nothing" to demonstrate they have a plan to win in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Republican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the biggest cover-up in political history," Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf. (AFP)

    S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq rally to records on rate cut hopes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The three major indices on Wall Street all gained on Wednesday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761098_1_20240711043449.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Wednesday with major indices finishing up more than one percent, hitting fresh records amid rising expectations for upcoming interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at all-time highs following comments from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank would not wait until inflation hit two percent before considering a rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Treasury bond yields retreated, with analysts citing strong demand at a 10-year Treasury note auction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones gained 1.1 percent to 38,921.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.0 percent to 5,633 for its sixth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.2 percent to 18,647 to end at its seventh straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell's remarks came in congressional testimony before a House panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said. "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo said the rally was notable one day before the market sees key new US consumer price data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell is basically telegraphing to the market that we are having a rate cut in September," Cardillo said. "That's what's behind the move here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Microsoft advanced 1.5 percent as the tech giant informed regulators that it will not take a non-voting position on the board of OpenAI amid scrutiny of its influence over the groundbreaking ChatGPT maker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Honeywell International gained 1.9 percent after announcing that it purchased Air Products' liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business for US$1.8 billion. Air Products advanced 0.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advanced Micro Devices won 3.9 percent as it announced plans to acquire Silo AI, the largest private artificial intelligence lab in Europe, for about US$665 million. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Twelve children were killed in South Africa on Wednesday when a minibus taking them to school near Johannesburg overturned and burst into flames after being hit by another vehicle, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The driver of the minibus was also killed and seven other children were rushed to hospital, according to officials in Johannesburg's Gauteng province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television images showed that the minibus was totally destroyed by the fire in the early morning crash in Merafong, more than 70 kilometres west of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charred schoolbook pages were scattered on the tarmac, as police examined the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A private scholar transport minibus was involved in a tragic accident in the Kokosi-Wedela area in Merafong, claiming the lives of the 12 learners and their driver," the Gauteng government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could not immediately give the ages of the children but said most were from a primary school, where students are normally aged between six and 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were burnt beyond recognition. When this happens forensics will have to do their part in terms of identification," said Gauteng traffic police department spokesman Sello Maremane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were investigating what happened but it appeared that the minibus was struck from behind by a small pick-up truck, causing it to overturn and catch fire, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver of the pick-up was also in hospital, reports said. By late afternoon, most of the children in hospital had been released, reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am profoundly saddened by this tragic event," Gauteng education minister Matome Chiloane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Africa has one of the most developed road networks on the continent but also has one of the worst road safety records, in part due to reckless driving and unroadworthy vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have always said to parents we need to check the condition of the vehicles that we put our kids in," Chiloane said at the scene of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many South African parents have to rely on private minibuses to get their children to school. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) on Wednesday formally named a star-studded 592-member team for this month's Olympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US squad, which is comprised of 314 female athletes and 278 male athletes, will be aiming to top the Olympic medal table for a fourth straight games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team includes Olympic stars such as gymnast Simone Biles, swimmer Katie Ledecky and NBA icon LeBron James.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with immense pride and excitement that we announce the 2024 US Olympic Team and the exceptional athletes that embody the spirit of dedication, resilience, and excellence, continuing the proud history of Team USA at the Olympic Games," USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US team includes more than 250 returning Olympians, including three five-time Olympians, four four-time Olympians and 16 three-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The squad includes 122 Olympic medallists, including 66 Olympic champions who boast a combined 110 gold medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forty-five athletes on the team have won multiple Olympic medals, while 23 have won multiple Olympic golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The youngest member of the team is gymnast Hezly Rivera, who turned 16 on June 4, while the oldest member of the squad is equestrian Steffen Peters, the 59-year-old German-born rider who first represented the United States at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. (AFP)

    'Fed would not wait for 2% inflation before rate cut'

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761095_1_20240711021008.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank will not want to wait for inflation to cool to its two percent target before considering a rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said in testimony to the US House Financial Services Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long," he added. In such a scenario, inflation would go well below the target level – which is also an undesirable outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell was responding to a question on whether the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, would need to dip below two percent at least once in the coming months before officials contemplate rate reductions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank leader's comments come a day after he noted recent inflation readings have shown "modest" progress, adding that "more good data" would boost confidence that price increases are cooling sustainably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat surging inflation, the Fed in recent years hiked the benchmark lending rate to a decades-high level in hopes of easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, policymakers have held rates at a 23-year high. While inflation has peaked, its downward progress has stalled somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Powell told lawmakers that he is not yet prepared to express confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the Fed's political independence, Powell added that this is critical to the central bank's ability to do its job and sustain the faith of people across the political spectrum. (AFP)

    Musetti through to semi-final, Djokovic gets free pass

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Musetti celebrates after winning his quarter-final match against Taylor Fritz. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761090_2_20240711081337.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lorenzo Musetti threw his head back and spread his arms wide to celebrate reaching his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon, then covered his face with both hands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25th-seeded Musetti, a 22-year-old from Italy, never had made it past the third round at the All England Club – or past the fourth round at any major tournament – until this fortnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He defeated 13th-seeded American Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, though, comes a far tougher test – taking on Novak Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic earlier progressed to a record-equalling 13th Wimbledon semi-final without hitting a ball on Wednesday after Alex de Minaur pulled out injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian ninth seed De Minaur, 25, announced shortly after midday at the All England Club that he was "devastated to pull out due to a hip injury."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Djokovic has now equalled Roger Federer's men's record of 13 semi-final appearances at Wimbledon as he closes on the Swiss great's mark of eight singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Serbian is also through to a record-extending 49th men's Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Minaur, who beat Djokovic at the United Cup in January, said: "It's no secret that this would have been the biggest match of my career but it's a unique injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I woke up this morning wanting to feel some sort of miracle, but there was a high risk of making the injury worse if I stepped on court. One stretch, one slide could take this from a three to six weeks' injury to four months out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a historic 25th Grand Slam triumph is coming into sharp focus for Djokovic, who demolished Holger Rune in straight sets in the fourth round on Tuesday. (AP/AFP)

    Israeli army orders evacuation of war-torn Gaza City

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Deadly Israeli air strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761088_1_20240710235703.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's army dropped thousands of leaflets over war-torn Gaza City on Wednesday urging all residents to flee a heavy offensive through the main city of the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaflets, addressed to "everyone in Gaza City," set out designated escape routes and warned that the urban area, which had a pre-war population of over half a million, would "remain a dangerous combat zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The warning came as Israeli troops, backed by tanks and aircraft, have fought Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in the heaviest combat the city has seen in months in the war raging since October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one operation, the army said it had killed militants and found weapons inside the long-vacated Gaza City headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere across Gaza, deadly strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days, sparking rebukes from France and Germany which both labelled the attacks "unacceptable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We call for these strikes to be fully investigated," said the French foreign ministry, highlighting a deadly strike on Tuesday on a school near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unacceptable that schools, especially those housing civilians displaced by the fighting, should be targeted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy fighting also raged in Gaza's far-southern Rafah, where witnesses said that Israeli tanks had rumbled into the city centre and unleashed intense fire on buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest fighting in Gaza has newly displaced 350,000 civilians, said UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini, who spoke before the leaflet drop and said "there is absolutely no safe space in Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One woman carrying her scant belongings through the ruins, Nimr al-Jamal, said that "this is the 12th time" her family has had to flee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How many times can we endure this? A thousand times? Where will we end up?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The upsurge in fighting, bombardment and displacement came as talks were to resume in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal to end the war now grinding on into its 10th month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief David Barnea arrived in Doha, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of their sensitivity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CIA director William Burns was also expected in the Qatari capital after holding talks in Cairo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile met US President Joe Biden's special envoy for the Middle East, Brett McGurk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu "emphasised his commitment" to a proposed truce plan, "as long as Israel's red lines are preserved," his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hawkish premier has repeatedly insisted that the war goals are to defeat Hamas and bring home all hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister's office said "14,000 terrorists have been eliminated" since the beginning of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Yoav Gallant separately told parliament that 60 percent of Hamas fighters had been "eliminated or wounded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The security establishment, and myself heading it, are determined to achieve the goals of the war and complete them," Gallant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli army said it was reviewing the Khan Younis area attack on Tuesday in which hospital sources said at least 29 people were killed in a school used as a displacement shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's Hamas government said a "majority" of the dead were women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed the wounded being rushed to the nearby Nasser hospital, many screaming in pain, as relatives wailed in grief for the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One wounded man, Osama Abu Daqqa, recounted that "suddenly the strike hit, people were injured and martyred and there was no one to help them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another survivor, Mohamed Sukkar, said those hit in the strike "were not part of the resistance nor were they armed, they were all civilians."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said a strike had hit near the school building and had targeted and killed a Hamas "terrorist" who had taken part in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was "looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al Awda school," which it acknowledged was "near the location of the strike."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The incident is under review."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three previous strikes since Saturday on Gaza schools used by displaced Palestinians have killed a total of at least 20 people, said Gaza officials and rescue services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lazzarini wrote on social media platform X that "schools have gone from safe places of education and hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death and misery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,295 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has also imposed a punishing siege on Gaza's 2.4 million people, eased only by sporadic aid deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aid group Doctors Without Borders has warned of "critical" shortages of medical supplies in Gaza, with no resupply for more than two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Independent UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign," a claim strongly rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Army spokesman David Baruch on Wednesday said that "the food is getting there, maybe not as much as everyone would want, but I don't see starvation." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police were searching on Wednesday for a suspect who may have a crossbow after the wife and two daughters of a BBC radio racing commentator were killed in a suspected "targeted" attack.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyle Clifford, 26, from north London, is wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC confirmed on its news website that the victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, aged 25 and 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local police said officers were called to a house in the town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said armed officers and specialist search teams were involved in the manhunt, urging Clifford to contact police and warning the public not to approach him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simpson called it "a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths "truly shocking" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning," she said. "It's really sad what's happened, very shocking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Wednesday said it was investigating suspected corruption involving frontline staff from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the case relates to procurement projects under HK$50,000 at public hospitals and possible violations of section 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight people were arrested. They have since been released pending further investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC added that more than 10 others were interviewed under caution, among them EMSD staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the EMSD said it will fully cooperate with the investigation and will not tolerate any illegal acts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to section 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, government officers must not solicit or accept any advantage as an inducement or reward.

  The Dentists Registration (Amendment) Bill also requires local dentistry graduates to intern at specified institutions for a year before registration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the bill's debate in Legco, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau called it a "historic moment" for the city's dental profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the most comprehensive amendment to the Dentists Registration Ordinance in Hong Kong in over 60 years," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that the Department of Health will start hiring non-locally trained dentists and aims to have the first batch arrive here in the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said there's a shortage of dentists in Hong Kong, with the shortfall expected to persist until 2040 before easing slightly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also reiterated that the one-year internship requirement has nothing to do with a shortage of dentists in the public sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if the Department of Health achieves zero vacancy through local and non-local recruitment in future, the government will undertake to arrange internships for all local dental graduates to enhance their skills. This will not be affected by manpower supply or demand," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The internship arrangement will apply to local dental students graduating in the summer of 2025 and onwards.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Taxi Council and lawmakers on Wednesday called on the government to make installing surveillance cameras inside taxis mandatory to enhance service quality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hang Seng University conducted a survey involving around 1,200 passengers, including both local residents and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's findings revealed that 57 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with the city’s taxi services, showing a slight uptick from 55 percent last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK after a press briefing at the Legislative Council, Ryan Wong, who chairs the taxi council, said there was room for improvement in taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We suggest the government consider it mandatory to install a central cloud-based camera system on taxis in order to monitor the driver's behaviour as well as to prevent illegal acts. And this is also supported by the general public, according to the survey result in this round," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs Legco’s transport panel, and transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick, also expressed their support for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in taxis, citing similar measures already in place on the mainland and in Macau.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it would launch a formal probe looking into EU practices during an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce will conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises," the ministry said in a note on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministry officials said they had decided to launch the probe following a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint mainly dealt with "products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment", according to the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation will last from July 10 to January 10, 2025, and could be extended to April 10, 2025 under special conditions, the ministry said. (Agencies)

    New sweatsuit helps remove sweat faster: researchers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers say the new 'iActive' sweatsuit can remove sweat three times faster than the maximum human sweating rate. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761021_1_20240710141806.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Polytechnic University say they have developed a new type of smart sweatsuit that helps athletes remove sweat faster.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "iActive" garment has a small device dubbed "artificial sweat glands” installed on the back. It uses low-voltage electricity to collect sweat and move it away from the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Shou Dahua, who led the research, said the device is safe to wear as it only has a low voltage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the idea for the sweatsuit came from how trees transport water through their roots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We collect the water via the root-like structure, and then we dissipate sweat on the bottom area using a low, safe voltage… The sweat dissipation rate is three times faster than the maximum human sweating rate,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition, our sportswear is 60 percent lighter and 50 percent less clingy when soaked, in comparison to conventional sportswear.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides athletes, the garment would also be suitable for outdoor workers, medical professionals and firefighters, Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sweatsuit can also be controlled by a smartphone app, allowing people to adjust the speed of sweat removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The research team said it has conducted various tests to ensure safety, finding that the sweat removal function doesn't deteriorate over time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Let's say after 500 laundry tests or after 100 hours of continuous use, the difference of sweat dissipation rate is quite small, less than five percent,” Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the team is in talks with different sports brands to commercialise the product and aims to price it at HK$800 per garment.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local companies were planning to allocate, on average, 4.3 percent of their annual budget towards employee training and development -- the highest percentage since 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was one of the findings from a survey by the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management which polled 108 companies across 20 industries with over 65,000 full-time employees between March and May this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banking and financial services topped actual spending on employee training at 6.2 percent, followed by the manufacturing sector at 5.8 percent and the hospitality sector at 4.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Average annual training hours per employee in 2023 remained similar to 2022 at 17.3 hours, with 76 percent of companies using webinars or virtual classrooms for training and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey found companies were looking to strengthen employees’ interpersonal and customer service skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “From the macro environment, there’s an urgent need to enhance customer service to attract customers, to retain customers because customer service is one of the core committed edge to outperform the competitors,” said the institute's chairman of learning and development committee Chester Tsang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding artificial intelligence (AI) usage, 77 percent of the surveyed companies allowed the use of AI, with 28 percent of employers providing relevant tools to their employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute suggested companies implement measures to boost employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates as the city faced a talent shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include providing advancement opportunities, identifying and nurturing potential successors, and providing relevant training programmes to employees to bridge skill gaps.

    Appointments underway for new mainland travel permit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In-person appointments began on Wednesday at China Travel Service centres across Hong Kong for people applying for new mainland travel permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The card allows permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens to travel to the mainland for up to 90 days at a time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man named Johan arrived early at one travel centre on Hong Kong Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just to make it easier to go to China because so far, I've had to apply for a visa, and the visa process is quite time-consuming, so this just makes things a lot easier," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ambos said he travels to the mainland for work several times a week and the new permit will make his trips easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I work with factories in China so every week I'm in [mainland] China two or three or four days. It's a great place to go buy products for different markets of the world. It's got good pricing and good-quality products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the rest of my company are all locals...and this card just makes it easier to go in and out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a woman surnamed Manna told RTHK she needed to make another appointment as she was missing a document from the Immigration Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The applying process is really easy actually, it's just an online submission. But I didn't know that I needed to get something from Tseung Kwan O [immigration office], that approval letter. So I have to go back and get it, and then actually I have to make another appointment," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that was not clear for me, because they said to get the documents, but I didn't get what the document was... But it's okay, three of my family members will be applying, so I can give the message to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Hart said he found the centre to be busy, but said that was understandable given it was the first day of appointments.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A union representing tens of thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea on Wednesday said it would extend a three-day strike indefinitely in a bid to force management to negotiate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike is the biggest labour action in the tech giant's history and steps up pressure on the chipmaker's management, who last week predicted a huge second-quarter operating profit increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(We) declare a second indefinite general strike from July 10, after learning that the management has no willingness to talk," the National Samsung Electronics Union said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 members stopped working Monday for what was meant to be a three-day strike, part of a long-running battle over pay and benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union has more than 30,000 members -- more than a fifth of the company's total workforce. (AFP)

 Mainland customs officers have caught a man at a border crossing point between Hong Kong and Shenzhen with over 100 live snakes stuffed in his trousers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news of the reptilian round-up was announced by China Customs on its official WeChat account on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers at the Futian boundary control point recently stopped the man, who was passing through the checkpoint without making any declarations, for an inspection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found 104 live snakes in six sealed drawstring bags that were in the man's pockets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were five types of reptiles, including milk snakes and corn snakes, with most of them being introduced species.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government was actively pursuing membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a summit organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Lee said the SAR could contribute to the regional economy by becoming a RCEP member.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can offer RCEP member enterprises a wider range of high-quality service options, including supply chain management services, and financial and professional services," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will assist them to better connect and leverage the limitless opportunities brought by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, promoting economic development and innovation in the RCEP member countries and the overall region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the current government administration had been seeking support from RCEP members by making overseas visits to regions such as the Middle East and ASEAN countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong offered a safe and convenient business environment for mainland companies to expand globally, and for foreign companies to enter the mainland market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi was on target as 2022 world champions Argentina turned on the style to beat Canada 2-0 on Tuesday and reach the Copa America final where they will look for a third straight major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-times Copa champions produced their best display of the tournament in front of a capacity crowd at the 82,500 MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina soaked up some early pressure before Julian Alvarez ghosted in between two defenders to open the scoring with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Messi had chances throughout the match and doubled the lead in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The truth is that it's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentina national team has been doing," Messi told TyC Sports after his first goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not easy for us to be in a final again, for us to compete again to be champions. I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defending Copa champions will face the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Uruguay and Colombia in what will be a highly anticipated final in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit," said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight," he added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index rose just over 90 points, or about 0.5 percent, at the opening on Wednesday to trade at around 17,613.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the US is "no longer an overheated economy," remarks that suggested the case for rate cuts is strengthening. Some investors had anticipated the Fed chair, in his testimony to a Senate banking panel, might do more than he did to telegraph that a cut was on track for the central bank's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index opened down 0.35 percent at 2,949. The Component Index in Shenzhen also opened lower, falling 0.39 percent to 8,672 points in early trading. (with additional reporting from Reuters and Xinhua)

 Consumer price inflation on the mainland slowed in June, while producer price deflation persisted, as Beijing's support measures set a bumpy economic recovery in motion for the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent rise in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CPI edged down 0.2 percent month-on-month, versus a 0.1 percent drop in May and worsening from an expected 0.1 percent fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) fell 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, narrowing from a 1.4 percent decline the previous month, and matching a forecast 0.8 percent fall. (Reuters)

    First choice allocations lower in scramble for schools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Education Bureau says 91 percent of primary six pupils got a secondary school place among their top three choices. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760957_1_20240710093545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parents choosing a secondary school for their child may have been too optimistic about securing their top choice in this year's secondary school allocation, which was announced on Tuesday. That's according to Rizwan Ullah, who is a secondary school vice-principal and a Kowloon City district councillor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Ullah said an overestimation of emigration may have been a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the number this year, one thing that could explain the drop is probably due to parents being a little bit aggressive with their strategy in finding a school for their children, believing the decline in student population will bring benefits to them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said with the children from the mainland talent scheme and with many parents competing for the same spot, this had led to a decrease in the percentage of children getting into their first choice of school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Education Bureau said 62 percent secured their first choice via central allocation, down from 66 percent last year, and the lowest since 2020. However 91 percent of the around 51,000 primary six pupils did get a place among their top three choices
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with some children in tears about not getting into one of their top three choices of school, Ullah said there were no bad schools and that parents shouldn't put too much pressure on their kids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The children are upset partly because we have created that expectation - if you don't get these three then the child will feel bad. It's just like running in a race, it's the first three. If you're the fourth, you don't get a medal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually, if you look, many students who go to these different schools, they do well in different aspects because we talk about whole-person development and we look at the healthy development of the child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said it was therefore important not to create too many expectations for children, as the child may have some hidden talent. He said it was just one part of the education process and there were other elements, going forward, like university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah also said parents should pick a school, which they believe matches their child's ability, so their child will have a higher chance of getting in.

    Alcaraz, Medvedev set up semi-final repeat, Sinner out

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev set up a Wimbledon semi-final repeat on Tuesday, while Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner to reach a second successive Wimbledon final four.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz battled back from a set down to defeat Tommy Paul 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 while Medvedev stunned world number one Jannik Sinner, who suffered a mid-match health scare, 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish world number three Alcaraz, seeking a fourth Grand Slam title, was broken twice by 12th-seeded Paul in a 72-minute first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three breaks in the third set put the Spaniard in charge and he stepped up another gear in the fourth, making just four unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, seeking to become just the sixth man to capture the French Open and Wimbledon titles back to back, defeated Medvedev in straights sets in last year's Wimbledon semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner in five sets on Tuesday to reach a second successive Wimbledon semi-final, subduing the gallant challenge of the Italian, who suffered a worrying mid-match health scare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-ranked Medvedev triumphed 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3 to avenge his Australian Open final loss to Sinner in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His four-hour victory also ended a five-match losing streak against the Italian as Medvedev reached his ninth Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a tight first set in which neither man gave up a break point, Medvedev edged ahead in the tie-break on the back of a lung-busting 33-shot rally. However, he squandered a set point and his game suddenly fell apart, serving up a double fault as Sinner pocketed the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mercurial Russian carved out the only break of the second set in the third game on his way to levelling the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner slipped another break down at 2-1 in the third set and immediately summoned the tournament physio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian, appearing distressed, had his blood pressure taken courtside before he left for a medical time-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a 10-minute delay, the 22-year-old resumed play and thrilled the Centre Court crowd when he bravely clawed his way back to 5-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Italian was undaunted and levelled the quarter-final on the back of breaks in the third and fifth games of the fourth set. But it was Medvedev finished the fresher of the two players, breaking in the final set on his way to victory. (AFP)

    Yamal makes history as Spain reach Euro 2024 final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Yamal becomes the youngest-ever scorer in a European Championship. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760947_1_20240710062439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani's opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will now face the winners of Wednesday's match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a anti-climactic end to France's tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France's Jules Kounde.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq edged to fresh records on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell reported "modest" progress in countering inflation ahead of the publication of influential US pricing data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," Powell told a Senate panel in remarks that kept alive hopes for potential interest rate cuts later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,291.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent to 5,576, while the Nasdaq also advanced 0.1 percent to 18,429, ending at a record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have seen the spate of recent records as reflecting a combination of still solid labour market data with improving inflation trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some market watchers think equities could be poised for a pullback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So much good news is already discounted in the market that it would be easy for it to get a bit of news that's negative and then correct," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "It's gone so far so fast."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides key inflation data, this week's calendar includes a spate of earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large banks, kicking off the second-quarter reporting season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Boeing fell 1.4 percent after reporting it delivered 44 planes in June, its best month so far in 2024. However, overall commercial plane deliveries for the second quarter still dropped by nearly one-third to 92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 3.7 percent, rising for the 10th straight session amid anticipation of the company's presentation on "Robotaxis" next month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli forces in war-ravaged Gaza City pushed on with a major offensive on Tuesday that has again displaced Palestinians, as UN experts said children were dying in a "starvation campaign."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Troops, tanks and fighter jets swooped on Gaza's biggest urban area on the eve of new contacts in Qatar aiming for an eventual hostage-prisoner exchange and a truce in the war raging into its 10th month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CIA director William Burns and Israel's Mossad chief David Barnea are due to travel to Qatar on Wednesday, after Burns held talks with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas, whose October 7 attack triggered the war, has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of deliberately escalating fighting in Gaza City and Rafah, in the territory's south, to thwart an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamist group's Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh said he had made "urgent contact" with mediators, warning that the "catastrophic consequences" of the latest battles could "reset the negotiation process to square one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, described the fighting in Gaza City in recent days as "the most intense in months."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants were fighting with rockets, mortars and explosives, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two weeks of battles in Gaza City's eastern Shujaiya district, Israeli forces have extended the fighting into the city's east, west and south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents reported helicopter strikes, "explosions and numerous gun battles" in the city's southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it was pursuing Palestinian militants in Gaza City, six months after it said it had dismantled Hamas's "military framework" in the territory's north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft struck the city as troops were engaged in "close-quarters combat," seizing weapons and destroying tunnels, the military said, reporting "dozens" of militants killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said tens of thousands of civilians have been affected by the surge in fighting since the first of three evacuation orders for Gaza City was declared on June 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands were seen marching down dusty roads past bombed-out buildings, with mothers carrying babies and others packing belongings onto donkey carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Human Rights Office said it was "appalled" at the way civilians, many of whom have been displaced multiple times, have been ordered to head to areas where "military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza City residents have now been told to move south to Deir al-Balah, which the UN office said "is already seriously overcrowded" with displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, independent UN rights experts accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign" that has resulted in the deaths of Gazan children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence," the experts said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thirty-four Palestinians have died from malnutrition since October 7, the majority being children," said the experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva accused the panel's members of "spreading misinformation" and "supporting Hamas propaganda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,243 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The toll includes at least 50 killed over the past 24 hours, said a ministry statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar and Egypt, supported by the United States, have been engaged in months of behind-the-scenes contacts to start truce talks and organise an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has signalled that it would drop its insistence on a "complete" ceasefire – which Israel had repeatedly rejected – as a condition for starting talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has set out conditions for talks, including that "any deal will allow Israel to return and fight until all the goals of the war are achieved," including the destruction of Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Gaza war has raged on, Israel has also exchanged regular cross-border fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah, allies of Hamas, heightening fears of an all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah on Tuesday released a video showing aerial surveillance footage it said was taken over intelligence and military positions in the Israeli-annexed Syrian Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release came after an Israeli strike killed a senior Hezbollah commander last week. The group's chief Hassan Nasrallah was expected to make a televised address on Wednesday at an event commemorating the slain fighter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Nasrallah on social media to "stop the threats and violence," and "withdraw" Hezbollah forces from the border area, in line with a 2006 UN Security Council resolution that ended their latest major war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanese government has supported the implementation of Resolution 1701, which called for armed personnel to pull back north of the Litani River, some 30 kilometres from the border with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a full-blown conflict breaks out, Israel's top diplomat said Nasrallah "will be considered the destroyer of Lebanon." (AFP)

    Labour takes governing seats as UK parliament returns

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's new lawmakers excitedly squeezed into parliament on Tuesday with Labour sitting on the government's side of the chamber for the first time in 14 years following last week's landslide election win.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 400 Labour MPs jostled for space on the ruling side of the green-benched House of Commons, with many having to stand, as parliament returned after being dissolved before Thursday's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the house for the first time as Britain's leader, vowing to "put an end to a politics that has too often seemed self-serving and self-obsessed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all have a duty to show that politics can be a force for good," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted the new parliament was "the most diverse parliament by race and gender this country has ever seen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the House of Commons Library, a record 263 or 40 percent of the 650 MPs are women, up from 220 in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 90 are from minority ethnic backgrounds, an increase from 66 five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rishi Sunak – Conservative prime minister until last week – made his first speech as leader of the opposition, and congratulated Starmer on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described being an MP as the "greatest honour, privilege and responsibility," in a congenial session that contrasted sharply with the usual arguing and shouting seen in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The session started with lawmakers re-electing Lindsay Hoyle as speaker of the house unopposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tradition dictated that he was physically dragged to the speakers' chair by colleagues, a custom rooted in the speaker's original function to communicate the Commons' opinions to the monarch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historically, if the monarch did not agree with the message being communicated then the early death of the speaker could follow – leading to reluctance among some to take up the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the addresses by Starmer and Sunak, other party leaders had their turn, including arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage who declared the five MPs from his anti-immigration Reform UK party the "new kids on the block."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have no experience in this parliament whatsoever, even though some of us have tried many times over the years previously," he said, a reference to his previous seven failed attempts to be elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament then began the lengthy process of swearing in all 650 MPs. Some 335 of them are new to parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the British monarchy and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Monday, new MPs have been receiving tours of the parliamentary estate, while some ex-lawmakers who lost their seats last week have been seen saying their goodbyes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour won 411 seats, securing a majority of more than 170 as it returned to power for the first time since Gordon Brown was prime minister in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tories suffered their worst-ever electoral defeat, succumbing to just 121 MPs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak is due to stay in charge of the party until the Conservatives work out the timetable for his successor to be chosen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new parliamentary session will officially begin after Starmer's government puts forward its priorities for the term in the King's speech on Wednesday 17 July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to include the establishment of a new publicly owned investment company called Great British Energy and a plan to renationalise Britain's much-maligned railways. (AFP)

    Ex-Liverpool striker Bellamy appointed Wales manager

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Craig Bellamy says he is keen to get started with their Nations League games. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760928_1_20240710003437.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Craig Bellamy has been appointed as the new head coach of the Wales national football team on a contract until 2028, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bellamy has replaced Rob Page, who was sacked following Wales' failure to qualify for Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old former Liverpool, Newcastle and Wales striker leaves Burnley, where he was assistant to former manager Vincent Kompany last season as they were relegated from the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will give my full commitment to develop this team and I am passionate to bring continued success into Welsh football," Bellamy told the FAW website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to get started with our Nations League games in September."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FAW's chief football officer, Dr David Adams, said: "I am absolutely delighted to announce Craig as our new head coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We undertook a thorough recruitment process for the new men's national team head coach and Craig was identified as the standout candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all looking forward to the Nations League games and working with Craig to deliver success for Welsh Football."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley chairman Alan Pace added: "I want to thank Craig for all his hard work during his time at Burnley and wish him the best for his new position as Wales manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Craig has been a very important part of our wonderful journey the last two years. I've admired his leadership, knowledge and passion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Page guided Wales to their first World Cup in 64 years in 2022 and to the second round of Euro 2020 but failed to reach this year's Euros, losing in a penalty shoot-out to Poland in a play-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he subsequently oversaw one of the most embarrassing results in Wales' history, a 0-0 draw with Gibraltar in a friendly and then suffered a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wales' next game is the opening match of their Nations League campaign against Turkey on September 6, with a trip to Montenegro three days later. (AFP)

    Fed's Powell sees 'modest' progress on inflation

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760920_1_20240709225800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve is making "modest" progress in its inflation fight, the head of the US central bank told lawmakers on Tuesday, on the first of two days of testimony in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  When prices surged in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed responded by hiking interest rates to a two-decade high as it attempts to cool down the US economy and return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation has eased significantly since it peaked in 2022, but progress stalled in the first quarter of this year, effectively putting the Fed's fight on pause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data in the second quarter has been more encouraging, prompting some cautious optimism from some policymakers in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers in Washington, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said most recent readings "have shown some modest further progress" since the first quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," he added during his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee to discuss the Fed's semi-annual monetary policy report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers on Tuesday – and again the following day in the House of Representatives – about the impact of the Fed's high interest rates on everyday Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is widely expected to remain on pause when it meets to set interest rates later this month, but could begin cutting rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures traders have assigned a probability of more than 75 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by mid-September, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also see it as more likely than not that the Fed will make another quarter percentage-point cut by the end of the year. (AFP)

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760907_1_20240709212955.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday held a flag presentation ceremony for the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics ahead of the start of the Games later this month, with Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan announcing higher rewards to further motivate athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I’m glad to learn about the Jockey Club Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, which will increase the reward for athletes. There will be a 20 percent increase in cash incentives in total compared with the last Olympics. For example, the reward for an individual gold medallist will be raised to HK$6 million. This is a great way to motivate our athletes to strive for better results,” he said at the ceremony at the government headquarters in Tamar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also revealed that due to the rising temperatures in Paris, the administration plans to provide air conditioners for athletes competing there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The order's been placed, the equipment's on its way… I'm going there on July 22nd, and I anticipate that all our rooms [will] have the air conditioning,” said Brian Stevenson, Chef de Mission for the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending a delegation of about 90 people to Paris. Among them are 35 athletes, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Épée fencer Vivian Kong, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is now heading to Paris as the world number one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said her mindset has changed since the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the biggest difference between these three years is that Tokyo gave me a lot of time to reflect on why I want to train, why I want to become better, why I want to win, because it doesn't seem to matter if people aren't healthy, if people aren't happy. There are more important things than sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think this time in Paris we can really enjoy sports... Hopefully everyone's healthy again and that it gives more purpose and motivation for me to do well.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For veteran swimmer Camille Cheng, this will be her third Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her family will be in Paris to see her in action in the Games for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think about this time of the season as really the fun part of the season. We've put in the hard work. It's all about the small details, fine-tuning things, focusing on recovery," Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And really, I think more than anything, it's about mentally so that you're in a happy place, that you're surrounded by positive energy... because for me I believe that a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sprinter Felix Diu made the final cut to the Olympics through a wild-card. The 100m specialist and first-time Olympian said his goal is to achieve a personal best at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My expectation for the Olympics is to get a [personal best time] for like 10.3 or 10.2 seconds,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Wai-fung, another Olympic debutant, secured Hong Kong's first-ever Taekwondo Olympic qualification. While excited about that, he said he feels the pressure of representing all the Taekwondo enthusiasts in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes to bring home a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will be held from July 26 to August 11.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has died while climbing Mount Fuji in Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to Japanese media, the 58-year-old man was found unconscious while climbing the mountain from Yamanashi prefecture on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was pronounced dead later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said it'd received a request for assistance. It has initiated follow-up actions through the commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese embassy in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added it has provided appropriate advice and assistance to the family members of the victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japanese media quoted local police as saying this was the first death reported since the opening of the 3,776m mountain to hikers this summer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong (ACGHK) organisers on Tuesday said they hope to avoid overcrowding issues at this year's event by charging separately for entry to the cosplay and exhibition areas, rather than issuing all-in-one tickets as they have in the past.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event from July 26 at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ACGHK's chief executive officer, Leung Chung-pun, said more than 140 exhibitors will take part in the fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Apart from Hong Kong citizens being the mainstream, we welcomed visitors from more than 30 countries and regions [last year]... ACGHK has a very stable foundation to continue developing into the most influential anime exhibition in the whole of Asia, or even the world,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticket details will be announced at a later date.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security Secretary Chris Tang said on Tuesday that the government has been discussing with Shenzhen officials a plan to speed up immigration clearance procedures at two border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A "collaborative inspection and joint clearance" arrangement at Huanggang Port and Sha Tau Kok will see e-channels and counters of both jurisdictions set up side by side, with travellers only having to have their documents checked once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrangement has been in place on the border between Macau and Zhuhai since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of a review of his bureau's work in the past year, Tang also noted in a social media post that since last week, Hong Kong permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens have been able to apply for five-year travel permits for the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He further noted that in May, mainland authorities expanded a travel scheme for mainland professionals from six industries to visit Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers resumed the search on Tuesday for 45 people still missing after a landslide at an illegal gold mine on Sulawesi island that killed at least 17 people, an official at the country's search and rescue agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain triggered the disaster on Sunday morning in the district of Suwawa in Gorontalo province, with the landslide engulfing miners and residents living nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salama, an official at Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said rescue efforts restarted on Tuesday after being temporarily halted on Monday due to heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 400 people were involved in the rescue operation, aided by a helicopter, said Salama.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far 52 people had been found alive, though the operation was being hampered by thick mud and with some rescuers having to walk more than 20km to reach the site of the disaster, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said torrential rains that have pounded the mountainous district since Saturday triggered the landslide and broke an embankment, causing floods up to the roofs of houses in five villages in Bone Bolango, which is part of a mountainous district in Gorontalo province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 300 houses were affected and more than 1,000 people fled for safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia's last major mining-related accident occurred in April 2022, when a landslide crashed onto an illegal traditional gold mine in North Sumatra’s Mandailing Natal district, killing 12 women who were looking for gold. (Reuters/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has allocated an additional 848 million yuan to support local flood rescue efforts, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fund, allocated by the MOF and the Ministry of Water Resources, will mainly be used to assist rescue work by local authorities in the flood-hit regions, including Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei and Guangdong provinces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, rescue personnel successfully sealed a 226m breach in a dyke at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, on Monday, according to local authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.31pm, the final truckload of rocks was dumped into the breach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sealing will expedite drainage and post-disaster reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The breach at Dongting Lake in the city of Yueyang in Hunan was caused by floodwaters from torrential rain, with more than 7,000 residents evacuated since the dyke burst on Friday afternoon. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mainland's central bank on Tuesday announced that global investors will be given more choice of collateral for trading government bonds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will allow offshore investors to use onshore bonds under Northbound Bond Connect as margin collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bonds are limited to those issued by the Ministry of Finance and mainland policy banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of the launch of Bond Connect, Jiang Huifen from the PBOC said the new move will reduce the cost for overseas investors to trade mainland bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to help further expand the application of renminbi bonds as eligible offshore collateral. It will facilitate overseas institutions to hold renminbi bonds, reducing the costs of overseas institutional investors to join Swap Connect. This initiative will be jointly prepared with Hong Kong and will be launched as soon as possible," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's market regulators and the stock exchange operator welcomed the PBOC's new initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said it plans to implement the new measure by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission said they will guide financial infrastructure institutions to take forward the preparatory work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure will provide Northbound Swap Connect investors with the additional choice of non-cash collateral, reducing their liquidity cost and improving capital efficiency. It will also help vitalise offshore investors' onshore bond holdings and further enhance the attractiveness of onshore bonds," an HKMA spokesperson said.

 Stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai were lower ahead of a key policy meeting in China next week.
 <br>

  The Communist Party will convene the third plenary session of its 20th central committee on July 15, focusing on issues related to further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders will also be keenly watching Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's remarks to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for any indications of when the Fed will start cutting rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell last week fanned hopes of a cut, saying the battle against inflation had made "progress" and the job market was cooling. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee says the pair chosen by mainland officials are now undergoing preparatory work in Sichuan. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760841_1_20240709114958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said mainland authorities have chosen two adult giant pandas, aged between five and eight, to be sent to Hong Kong as gifts, hoping the pair will be able to breed in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said the male panda, which weighs around 120 kilogrammes, is agile and smart, while the 100-kilogramme female panda is gentle and cute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up a three-day visit to Sichuan, the chief executive thanked mainland officials for thoroughly considering the city's requests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had earlier expressed to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration the hope that the two new giant pandas would be able to give birth to the next generation of pandas in Hong Kong, bringing more warmth and joy to Hong Kong. We also hope the giant pandas will be younger adults and physically strong," he told reporters in Chengdu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This pair are now undergoing preparatory work in Dujiangyan, and will be quarantined for 30 days later on. When they arrive in Hong Kong, they will be quarantined for another 30 days. They will then be given time to adapt, before meeting the public."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Ocean Park will sign a cooperation pact with a mainland giant panda research and breeding facility, and that Hong Kong aims to have the pair arrive by National Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a government statement, the CE highlighted three achievements made during the visit: "the pair of giant pandas to be gifted to Hong Kong have been selected; Ocean Park and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda are working at full steam to draft a co-operation agreement on the details to expedite the approval and implementation of the process; and the establishment of communication channels between Ocean Park, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda to collaborate with and assist one another in facilitating the smooth transfer of the giant pandas to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the culture, sports and tourism minister, said Ocean Park is sending staff members to the province to better understand the giant pandas, while bringing with them bamboo the pair will be consuming in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Ocean Park] will enhance its two facilities for giant pandas, such as adding some plants or climbing frames. We are also considering installing cameras to hopefully share the pandas' activities with the public in real time," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the park will assist with the physical examination of the animals.

    Nato meets in Washington as questions swirl over Biden

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Leaders of Nato's 32 member countries will meet in Washington for a summit of the transatlantic security alliance, with further military and financial support for Ukraine high on the agenda. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760842_1_20240709120924.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato leaders gather on Tuesday in Washington for a summit aimed at showing resolve against Russia and support for Ukraine – but the meeting is set to be overshadowed by US President Joe Biden's fight for political survival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old leader will try to use the three days of pomp marking Nato's 75th anniversary to reassure allies over US leadership, and his own ability to govern, as calls grow for him to quit the fight for a second term in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has so far defied pressure from some within his own party to step aside, after a bad debate performance against election rival Donald Trump last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our allies are looking for US leadership," Biden said in an interview on Monday. "Who else do you think could step in here and do this? I expanded Nato. I solidified Nato."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As doubts swirl over Biden, the rest of the 32-nation alliance is nervously eyeing a potential return to the White House by Trump after elections in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the campaign trail the ex-reality TV star has threatened to blow apart the principle of mutual self-defence that has underpinned Nato since it was founded in the wake of the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is not just the United States that faces political questions. French President Emmanuel Macron arrives after fending off a push by the country's far-right to win power, new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has his first international outing, and Hungary's premier Viktor Orban flies in after a much-criticised meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said he would discuss with Nato leaders the distinct threat North Korea poses to Europe by deepening military ties with Russia, warning that Moscow must choose between the two Koreas where its true interests lie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It "depends entirely" on Russia where it wants to take future ties with South Korea, Yoon said, adding that Seoul would make a decision on weapons support for Ukraine based on how a new military pact between Moscow and Pyongyang plays out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Military co-operation between Russia and North Korea poses a distinct threat and grave challenge to the peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Europe," Yoon said. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of performers are gathering in Hong Kong for a six-day event that combines Chinese martial arts and dance to showcase the rich heritage of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Kungfu x Dance Carnival aims to help people develop a deeper appreciation of traditional Chinese culture through a variety of activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video message at the opening ceremony in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive John Lee described the carnival as one of the biggest events in Hong Kong this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the carnival uniquely combines martial arts and dance to showcase the charm of Chinese culture, adding that it serves as a platform to promote cultural exchanges between China and other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Ya, founder of Tangya Arts Tech, which organises the event, said she was delighted to bring together performers from around the world, adding that it was a demonstration of Hong Kong's strength as a centre for cultural and artistic exchange between China and the rest of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are delighted to have attracted 3,000 performers from Hong Kong, the mainland, Macau and more than 10 other countries around the world. They range from four-year-old children to an 82-year-old Tai Chi master from Japan and a 96-year-old Choy Li Fut martial arts master," she said.

 Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Tuesday said authorities must strike a balance between public finances and how much public housing tenants can afford to pay in rent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made the comment after the Housing Authority proposed raising public housing rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some elderly tenants have expressed concerns that they will struggle to afford the increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said authorities have to strike a balance between public affordability and financial stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone understands that the rent for public housing is much cheaper than in the private market... In public housing, we take care of the living environment, cleanliness, rubbish collection, and maintenance. The rent is low but it helps us maintain financial stability," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister said poor families can apply for rent assistance that cuts their rent by up to 50 percent, adding that the government has been paying the rent for those supported by Comprehensive Social Security Assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has attacked cities across Ukraine with a missile barrage that killed more than three dozen people and ripped open a children's hospital in Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of volunteers including hospital staff and rescue workers dug through debris from the Okhmatdyt paediatric hospital in search for survivors after the rare day-time bombardment on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched dozens of missiles toward five towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine as well as the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 37 people were killed, including three children, with more than 170 wounded, Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strikes damaged nearly 100 buildings, including multiple schools and a maternity hospital, he added. The air force said air defence systems downed 30 projectiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary to shoot down Russian missiles. It is necessary to destroy the Russian combat aircraft on its bases. It is necessary to take strong steps that will not leave any security deficit," Zelensky said ahead of a Nato summit where arming Ukraine's air defences is expected to top the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the barrage and urged Ukraine's allies to deliver "a stronger response" to Russia's attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the strikes, US President Joe Biden on Monday promised "new measures" to boost Ukraine's air defences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with our allies, we will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine's air defences to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack spurred a fire at a power substation and at an oil depot in Russia's Volgograd region, the governor of the region in southern Russia said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Air defence and electronic warfare forces suppressed a UAV [unnamed aerial vehicle] attack on the territory of the Volgograd region," Andrei Bocharov, the governor, said in a post published on the Telegram channel of the region's administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of falling UAV debris, fires broke out at a substation in Frolovo and an oil depot in Kalach-on-the-Don." (AFP/Reuters)
