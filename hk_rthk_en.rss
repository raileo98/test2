<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Debby landed in Florida on Monday bringing high winds, pouring rain – and 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than US$1 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Debby, which hit the state's northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, washed the trove of drugs ashore along Florida's southernmost tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane Debby blew 25 packages of cocaine onto a beach in the Florida Keys," US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The load of drugs, which Briggs reported was valued at more than US$1 million, was discovered by a good Samaritan who contacted the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July of 2023, the mayor of Tampa, Florida similarly discovered 31.7 kilogrammes of cocaine that had been washed ashore in the Florida Keys, while enjoying a vacation day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to bringing cocaine, Debby has killed one person, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, and could produce life-threatening storm surges as well as catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Keys, a string of islands stretching off the state's southern tip, are located in close proximity to a number of Caribbean countries that serve as a transit hub for cocaine being trafficked from South America to Europe and North America, including into Florida. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark's Viktor Axelsen successfully defended his Olympic badminton title on Monday, demolishing Thailand's world champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn in the men's singles final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Backed by a vocal crowd of Danish fans at La Chapelle Arena, the second-seeded Axelsen battled past his eighth-seeded opponent 21-11, 21-11 in 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lanky Dane became the first man to retain his Olympic men's singles title since Chinese legend Lin Dan, who won in 2008 and 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitidsarn's silver was Thailand's first-ever Olympic medal in badminton.

    Gaza officials bury 80 corpses handed over by Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764883_1_20240805233236.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We received 80 bodies inside 15 bags, with more than four martyrs in each bag, each wrapped in a single shroud", said Civil Defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Suleiman said Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not know if they are martyrs (killed in Gaza) or prisoners from (Israel's) jails," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video released by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, men in hazmat suits could be seen inspecting the corpses, before unloading them from the shipping container they had arrived in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The footage then showed the bodies being laid in a line for burial in a mass grave dug in the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were later buried at the Turkish cemetery, near Khan Younis, the main city in the southern part of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salwa Karaz, a displaced woman from Gaza City in the north, said that she had gone to the Turkish cemetery hoping to find her 32-year-old son Marwan, who went missing in January. He left behind an eight-month-old son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we learned that 80 bodies had been handed over, we came to search in hopes of finding him among them", said the 59-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of now, we have not learned anything," she lamented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will try to identify him through his clothes. He was wearing brown pants, a navy blue shirt, a black jacket, and beige boots."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She last saw him leaving on his bicycle from their shelter in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Hamas said Israel's delivery of bodies without identities "exacerbates the suffering of the families of martyrs and the missing, who seek to know the fate of their abducted children or to bury their martyrs in a dignified manner."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Hamas government sources said Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were then buried in Gaza, the sources added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to Gaza's health ministry which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rebeca Andrade of Brazil got the better of American Simone Biles in the women’s floor exercise final on Monday, bringing the artistic gymnastics competition to an end at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andrade brought flair to her routine at the Bercy Arena, as she executed every move with precision to earn a difficulty score of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.266, to bring the total to 14.166.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the Brazilian's first gold medal in Paris after she won two silvers in the all-around and vault and a bronze in the team event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who was the floor champion in Rio in 2016, brought the highest difficulty of 6.900 to the competition with skills named after her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed her routine with incredible height and technique, but she stepped out of bounds which led to a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles ended up with a final score of 14.133 to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old finished the Paris Games with three golds and one silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles’ teammate Jordan Chiles was the final performer of the competition, and was fifth after her routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her score was bumped to a 13.766 after an inquiry, beating out Ana Barbosu of Romania for the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Ou Yushan finished eighth of the nine competitors with a score of 13.000.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shinnosuke Oka of Japan has captured his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics, winning the horizontal bar final on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka executed a clean routine to come away with a score of 14.533.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a difficulty of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.633.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia’s Angel Barajas also had a score of 14.533 but had to settle for silver because Oka had a higher execution mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both were competing in their first Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the fourth medal in Paris for Oka, who has already won gold in the team event and the all-around as well as a bronze in the parallel bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Zhang Boheng and Tang Chia-hung of Chinese Taipei shared the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang, also a first-time Olympian, completed his routine with clean technique and execution, but the 24-year-old wasn’t able to stick his dismount, falling forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a 13.966 with a difficulty of 6.500 and execution of 7.466.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had a small fall in the middle of his routine, but the rest of his technique was able to pull him to a 13.966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The horizontal bar final saw its share of errors and falls, including China’s Su Weide who was unable to land on his feet, leaning forward to catch himself with his hands. He finished in fifth place.

    Bangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman takes charge

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters march towards Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's palace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764866_1_20240805212642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman spent nearly four decades rising to the top of the military and said on Monday he was "taking full responsibility" after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bedecked with medal ribbons on his green fatigues and wearing a four-star general's cap, Waker said 76-year-old Hasina had quit and that the army would "form an interim government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I give you my word that all the injustices will be addressed," the career infantry officer said in a broadcast to the nation on state television, although it was not immediately clear if he would head the new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed – it is time to stop the violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mild-looking, bespectacled officer was appointed as chief of army staff, the military's top job, only in June. Hasina had trusted him because he was a distant relative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The experienced soldier has served as a UN peacekeeper as well as in Hasina's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His father-in-law was army chief during the first of Hasina's five terms as prime minister from 1996-2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a caretaker government for two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina then ruled Bangladesh from 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protesters stormed Hasina's palace on Monday and she fled by helicopter, Waker said he would speak to the president to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed that the new authorities would "prosecute all murders" following weeks of deadly protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army was deployed on the streets to crush the protests last month but shifted on Sunday and in several instances allowed demonstrations to go on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker said he had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members, although not with Hasina's Awami League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of us together will forge a beautiful future," he said. "If we work together, we can achieve a favourable outcome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh Military Academy graduate, who served two tours as a UN peacekeeper in Angola and Liberia, called for the weeks of protests to stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 300 people were killed in the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the situation gets better, there is no need for emergency," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker appealed to the university students who first launched protests in early July to support the army. The protests were initially against government hiring rules but spiralled into demands for Hasina to leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the task of the students is to keep calm and help us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker, who Bangladeshi media say is aged 57 or 58, also received officer training in Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Married with two daughters, he holds master's degrees in defence studies from Bangladesh's National University and King's College London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was commissioned in 1985, also serving as an instructor at the army's college for infantry and tactics and at Bangladesh's institute for peace support operations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Simone Biles fell out of medal contention in the women’s artistic gymnastics balance beam final on Monday at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Italy’s Alice D’Amato finished a solid routine to earn a score 14.366, with a difficulty score of 5.800 and an execution score of 8.566, for her first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Zhou Yaqin earned silver thanks to a strong finish. She started off the competition with a clean routine, adding many connecting elements to boost her difficulty score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 18-year-old gymnast lost her balance at one point, but she was able to stay on the beam to earn her a 14.100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhou finished a close second behind Biles at the World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Italian gymnast, Manila Esposito, completed the podium in Paris with a score of 14.000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles slipped and fell off the apparatus at the end of her acrobatic series, unable to complete the last flip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to finish her routine and stick the landing, and the 27-year-old was tied for fourth.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Zou Jingyuan retained his title in the men’s artistic gymnastics parallel bars on Monday at the Paris Olympics, while compatriot Zhang Boheng missed out of the podium after being edged out by Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The reigning champion executed his routine with precision, hitting each handstand and hold to earn him a difficulty score of 6.900 and an execution score of 9.300, for an overall 16.200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun won silver with the highest difficulty of the competition of 7.000, to earn a 15.500 total.
  <br/>

  China’s Zhang had been in third for much of the competition, but was ultimately overtaken by Oka, who earned 15.300.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were a total of eight competitors at this event.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's An Se-young consolidated her status as the top player in women's badminton by winning the Olympic title on Monday, beating China's He Bingjiao in the final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Reigning world champion An, who has held the number one ranking for the past year, beat her sixth-seeded opponent 21-13, 21-16 at a lively La Chapelle Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old An is the dominant force in women's badminton and won eight titles on the world tour last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She became South Korea's first Olympic women's singles champion since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He, who lost the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, progressed to the final when her opponent Carolina Marin retired from their semi-final after collapsing with a knee injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was looking to win China's third badminton gold of the Paris Games, following successes in mixed and women's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made An work for every point in a fast and furious first game, until the South Korean began to ease ahead towards the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She closed the first game out when He smashed a return into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An quickly gained the upper hand in the second game and her march towards the title began to look inevitable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He slowed her progress with an incredible smash return midway through the game but An would not be stopped and she sealed the win on her third match point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My golden age isn't here yet because I'm still young," the South Korean gold medallist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will still have more experiences and I will be able to play even better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said she was happy to take home the silver medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think from the moment I qualified for the Olympics it’s been a hard journey, since at the time I was only able to come here because I won by a slight margin by the end. So I treasure this opportunity a lot, and I am very happy that I can come all the way from preliminaries to the end."
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bank of China (Hong Kong) said the outlook for the SAR and mainland economies is positive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said the local economy is seeing a stable recovery, with strong inbound tourist figures and low unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also said retail sales remained weak and housing prices could drop "by a small margin" this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the world's second-largest economy, the bank believes it will reach its 5 percent growth target for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still believe that the growth rate in China will eventually translate to the growth rate in China's enterprise sector, I mean all the corporates in China," said Ding Meng, senior economist of Bank of China (Hong Kong).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we are anticipating the improvement of the profits prospect in China-related investments, so we are kind of positive for the stock market here in Hong Kong and also in mainland China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank also said it expects the US Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September or December this year.

 Veteran sharpshooter Li Yuehong claimed his maiden gold medal in his third Olympic appearance with victory in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old world-record holder made 32 hits in the final to secure China's fifth shooting gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's Cho Yeong-jae won silver, scoring 25, while Li's compatriot Wang Xinjie took bronze.

  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible experience for me – all of my personal hard work and the effort my team put into this game have finally paid off," Li said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a victory not only for myself, but rather for the whole team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li won bronze at both the Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo Olympics.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government adviser says most people won't need to get a Covid booster shot again. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764819_1_20240805161830.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government adviser on Covid suggested on Monday that the cost-effectiveness and coverage of Covid booster vaccinations should be assessed in the long term as infections become milder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases currently recommends a booster shot every six months for high-risk groups such as the over-50s and those with underlying health conditions. They can receive the booster free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's chairman, Professor Lau Yu-lung, said there has been a slight increase in Covid cases recently, but this is not a cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From a public health perspective, we really need some kind of a study to assess the cost-effectiveness... it might not be necessary to administer as in the past, the whole scale of approach for a lot of people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Recently, because of the upsurge of all the monitoring indices, as well as you can just learn from your friends and families who got infected, most of them are really very mild... Indeed every successive infection will be milder than the previous infection until you won't even notice it."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says hot weather led to increased electricity demand. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764812_1_20240805153704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday announced a mid-year net profit of HK$5.95 billion, a near 18 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company said Hong Kong’s accelerated economic recovery, along with hotter weather, led to increased electricity demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Australian and Indian business also improved, offsetting the impact of reduced electricity generation at its nuclear power plants on the mainland due to scheduled maintenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP also pointed to various renewable energy projects on the mainland, saying they will be the key drivers for its profit in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s revenue rose to HK$44.09 billion, an almost 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.63 per share, matching the first interim dividend of the year and unchanged from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have always been generating revenue and dividends for the benefit of our shareholders. And we adopt a policy to have a reliable and consistent dividend with steady growth supported by sustainable business development,” said CLP's chief executive officer TK Chiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we will continue to grow the business and if the condition approves, of course, we will try to adjust our dividend. But at the end of the day, the dividend will be approved by the board.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiang also said any further reduction in prices for consumers in the remainder of the year will depend on the international fuel market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because of the continued easing of the energy prices globally, we saw tariff reduction. From January up to August, the tariff for CLP's customers in Hong Kong saw a reduction of about 2 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the remaining part of the year, it will really depend on the international fuel price trend. If the fuel price continues to follow the current trend, there could be an opportunity for further adjustments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about progress in reviewing its power management system following several voltage dips this year, Chiang said the company is working on solutions to minimise the impact such incidents have on customers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, driven by last week's plunge in global stock markets, economic concerns and worries investments funded by a cheap yen were being unwound.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei share average shed a staggering 12.4 percent as Friday's dismal US jobs data heightened worries of a possible recession, and as the yen rallied to seven-month highs versus the US dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27 percent drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the close on Monday, the index closed at 31,458.42 and had wiped out 113 trillion yen (US$792.32 billion) of that peak market value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks," said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after a soft jobs report stoked fears of an oncoming recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the US economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike," said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen was last up 2.5 percent at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14 percent in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The banking sector slumped 17 percent to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader Topix fell 12.2 percent to 2,227.15. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested 119 people in a two-week anti-triad operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they shut down five alleged vice establishments, seven suspected gambling dens, as well as a facility they believe was being used to manufacture illegal drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Inspector Thomas Anthony Lo said the force believes it also busted a syndicate that had scammed people selling luxury goods on social media by making purchases with fake banknotes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group would claim to help the victims inspect and authenticate the items they were selling. At the same time, the alleged scammers would use transparent, plastic bags that contained a pile of cash to district the victims. The victims would also be instructed to go to another room to give their signatures," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this period, the syndicate would take the opportunity to take away the victims' valuables, leave the scene and never return."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the victims, who lost HK$2 million between them, later realised that only the banknotes on the top and bottom of the stacks were real and the rest were counterfeit.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Passengers who were overcharged by the operator of four New Territories minibus routes can get a refund from Monday, transport authorities announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department earlier revealed that the green-top minibus routes operated by Fully Mint Limited – 501A, 501C, 501K and 501S – had been charging passengers more than the approved fares for over two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that from May 19 to July 26, the operator set fares between HK$0.3 and HK$1 higher than the permitted amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A department spokesperson on Monday said passengers affected can get the excess fare amounts back either in cash or via electronic payment methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As beneficiaries under the Government Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities were not affected by the overcharging incident, refund is not needed. The [green minibus] operator will reimburse the government for the overpaid subsidies under the scheme," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers who paid by Octopus can claim a refund via the mobile app or at an Octopus Service Point, while people who paid in cash get can their refund from the minibus operator at Wo Mun Street PLB Terminus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alipay and AlipayHK, for their part, said the overcharged fares have been refunded directly to users affected.

    UK PM Starmer vows rioters will 'regret' disorder

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police wearing riot protection equipment patrol the seafront esplanade following an anti-immigration protest in Weymouth, Britain. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764768_1_20240805092549.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK leader Keir Starmer warned far-right protesters on Sunday they would "regret" participating in England's worst rioting in 13 years, as disturbances linked to the murder of three children earlier this week flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about the mass stabbing last Monday in the northwestern English seaside town of Southport has hit multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is a major challenge for Starmer, elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves," Starmer said in a TV address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was "no justification" for what he called "far-right thuggery", he added, promising to bring the perpetrators "to justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the northeastern English city of Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters squared up to riot police carrying shields. Some threw bricks, cans and pots at officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters there seized a camera from an AFP crew and broke it. The journalists were not injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh disturbances came after police said more than 150 people had been arrested since Saturday following skirmishes at far-right rallies in Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police -- injuring several officers -- and looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since summer 2011, when widespread rioting followed the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late Sunday, Staffordshire police said another hotel known to have sheltered asylum seekers was targeted near Birmingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large group of individuals" have been "throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police" at the hotel in the town of Tamworth, with one officer injured, said the statement. (AFP)

    Sprinter Felix Diu eyes new HK 100m record after Paris
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu says he wants to set a new Hong Kong record in the men’s 100m sprint. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764679_2_20240804164357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu, fresh from his Olympic debut in Paris, said he now wants to set a new SAR record in the men’s 100m.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Diu finished fourth in his heat at the Paris Games in 10.62 seconds, and said he was thrilled to have competed with the world's top runners at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s quite awesome, because we've seen a lot of world-class athletes here and it's a great experience to see such a huge venue here and a lot of people watching me compete in the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Olympic debutant was taking part despite a leg injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu entered the Paris Games through a wild card. Olympic qualification for the 100m sprint was 10 seconds, and his personal best is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprinter said his next goal is to break the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100m specialist noted that for the first time, the Olympic track is in purple, instead of red or blue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's made with recycled shells produced by the fishing industry, as part of efforts to promote sustainability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the track at the Stade de France is not completely rubber on the bottom but is filled with air cells of a geometric shape, to boost athletes’ performances and prevent injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the purple track is really making the athletes really comfortable to combat in and also the material they use is very bouncing, so it's really helpful for our performance,” Diu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu started training in secondary school because he enjoyed the excitement of sprinting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I just quite enjoy the process of training and competition. It brings me satisfaction and excitement,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And with the Los Angeles Games four years away, he said he will continue to improve his game and work hard as a full-time athlete.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris, a pavilion has been set up on the sidelines of the Olympic Games to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between China and France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China House – featuring Chinese-style galleries, exhibits and ancient Olympic sports – was launched by the Chinese Olympic Committee two days before the opening of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's deputy secretary general Yu Jianyong said the China House "is a bridge to promote friendly exchanges between China and foreign countries and promote the mutual construction of civilisations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A team of volunteers maintains its operation, some of whom are from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was a dream come true to be part of the Games and experience the Olympic hype in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raheema, a Chinese-Pakistani studying in the SAR, said the experience allowed her to step out of her comfort zone and meet people from all over the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As someone that is really introverted, it's really hard for me to be able to communicate with others,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics is about bringing different people with different backgrounds and different stories all together, being able to communicate with everyone I can broaden my horizons and also understand more about different people.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another volunteer, Annie, said she was inspired after seeing the earliest forms of Olympic sports at the China House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We feel like we can learn a lot more about the whole historical part and at the same time to really experience the whole Olympic atmosphere in person right in France this year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Annie added that she also found it inspirational to speak with athletes from the national team there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the visitors at the China House was a diving gold medallist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, He Chong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he thinks people should just enjoy the Games and not put too much pressure on athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we should look at these [athletes] with a more rational perspective. They are here to join the world's top sports event and chase their dreams. We should not focus on how many gold medals they can win for China."

 World records broken, defending champions prevailing, and one of the closest finishes to the men's 100 metre dash in Olympic history, were among the highlights of Day 9 in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the Games now in their second week, the US heads the medals table with 19 golds while China are second with the same amount of golds but fewer medals overall than the Americans. Hosts France are third.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, the Americans closed out the meet at the top of the swimming medals table thanks to world record efforts from Bobby Finke in the men's 1,500m freestyle and the US women in the 4x100m medley relay.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Noah Lyles of the United States won an enthralling and dramatic men's Olympic men's 100 metres final by fractions of a second in a time of 9.79 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kishane Thompson of Jamaica took the silver in the same time and Fred Kerley of the US claimed bronze in 9.81.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time an American had won the title since Justin Gatlin in 2004 and Lyles raised his arms in triumph to wild cheers from the packed crowd at the Stade de France as his name appeared at the top of the standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made a slower start out of the blocks than his rivals but accelerated through the finish to clinch victory by five thousandths of a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh completed her trophy cabinet with the women's Olympic high jump gold medal, clearing 2.00 metres in front of an adoring crowd at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Nicola Olyslagers took silver and Ukraine's Iryna Gerashchenko and Australian Eleanor Patterson shared the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahuchikh fled her home in Dnipro after Russia's attack on Ukraine in 2022 but has kept her competitive career going and claimed Olympic gold weeks after breaking a world record that had stood since 1987 with a leap of 2.10m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world champion cleared the winning height on her first attempt and took the gold over the Australian by virtue of having fewer failures, bowing to the crowd as she took one shot at clearing 2.04m but knocked the bar down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Canada's Ethan Katzberg won gold in the men's hammer throw, cementing his dominance of the discipline after becoming the youngest ever world champion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katzberg, 22, who cuts a distinctive figure with his moustache and long curly hair, asserted himself with a first throw of 84.12 metres, and none of his rivals could respond.
  <br/>

    Zelensky says Ukraine has received first F-16 jets

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine has received its first batch of US-made F-16 fighter jets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, quickly adding that more are needed to beat back Russian forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For more than two years, Ukraine has pleaded with its Western partners for the aircraft – long considered the crown jewel in the sprawling list of military hardware Kyiv has sought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We often heard the word 'impossible'. Now it is a reality. Reality in our skies. F-16s in Ukraine. We made it happen," Zelensky said, as some flew above him during the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky was standing in front of what looked like two grey, partially-covered F-16s branded with the Ukrainian trident, in a location reporters were asked not to disclose for security reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud of all our guys who are mastering these aircraft and have already started using them for our country," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not say how many jets had been delivered and declined to comment on their specific tasks, but journalists saw at least two F-16s on the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement was welcomed by many as Kyiv's forces are struggling to hold back advances by Russian troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the combat aircraft we have been waiting for, which can significantly enhance our capabilities," said Parliament chairman Ruslan Stefanchuk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv hopes the arrival of the fighter jets – touted for their precision, speed and range – will enable it to better protect itself from Russian bombardment. (AFP)

 China dethroned the United States in the men's 4x100m medley relay, winning gold in a time of three minutes, 27.46 seconds, edging the US into silver by 0.55 seconds at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France won the bronze, handing swimming star Leon Marchand his fifth medal of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu Jiayu and Qin Haiyang kept the Chinese in contention in the back and breast strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's Maxime Grousset and the US's Caleb Dressel pulled ahead of Sun Jiajun in the fly portion of the race, but an incredible 45.92 anchor leg from Pan Zhanle, the world record holder in the 100 metres free, ensured the win for China who ended America's 64-year unbeaten run in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in the women's medley relay, the Americans dominated, smashing their own world record in the event to close the swimming meet at the Olympics with the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia took the silver and China grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US quartet of Regan Smith, Lilly King, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske touched out with a final time of 3 minutes 49.63 seconds at the La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Bobby Finke smashed the men's 1,500 metres freestyle world record as he retained the Olympic gold medal in a thrilling swim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After 30 lung-busting laps, Finke touched the wall in 14 minutes, 30.67 seconds, eclipsing Chinese star Sun Yang's 12-year-old mark of 14:31.02 set at the London Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri took silver, 3.88 seconds behind Finke, with Daniel Wiffen, the 800m gold medallist, taking the bronze for Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Swedish sprint star Sarah Sjostrom completed a freestyle sprint double by adding the women's 50 metres gold to her 100 title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Meg Harris took the silver as the only other woman under 24 seconds and China's Zhang Yufei the bronze for her sixth medal of the Games and 10th of her career. (Agencies)

    Celtic start SPL title defence by crushing Kilmarnock

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Celtic made a flying start to their bid for a fourth successive Scottish Premiership title as the champions routed Kilmarnock 4-0 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brendan Rodgers' side finished eight points clear of second placed Rangers last term and they are already in pole position in the 2024/25 title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Celtic have reigned supreme in Scotland in 12 of the last 13 seasons and the opening weekend of the new campaign underlined why the Hoops are firm favourites to extend their dominant era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chasing a 55th Scottish title, Celtic could not have made a better start as Kilmarnock were brushed aside at Parkhead, just 24 hours after Rangers were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw at Hearts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jim Craig, a European Cup winner with Celtic in 1967, unfurled the Premiership champions' flag before kick-off and Rodgers' men ensured the party atmosphere would last right up until the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark keeper Kasper Schmeichel made his Celtic debut in an otherwise familiar line-up which was only missing the injured Daizen Maeda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's Reo Hatate opened the scoring in the 17th minute with a powerful drive from the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liam Scales headed home from Matt O'Riley's corner five minutes before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kilmarnock boss Derek McInnes rested key players ahead of his side's Uefa Conference League qualifier against Tromso on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Celtic took full advantage as Nicolas Kuhn's deflected effort flashed into the net after 59 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Anthony Ralston lashed home from a tight angle in stoppage-time as Celtic moved ahead of St Mirren on goal difference at the top of the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Sunday, Dundee fought back twice to deny arch rivals Dundee United a winning return to the top tier in a dramatic 2-2 draw at Tannadice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United were given a guard of honour on to the pitch by Dundee's players in recognition of their Championship title triumph last term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts made a strong start to the derby as goals from Kristijan Trapanovski and Miller Thomson, either side of Seb Palmer-Houlden's equaliser, put them in control at the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a late penalty from Dundee captain Luke McCowan earned them a share of the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  St Mirren followed their midweek European success by opening their domestic schedule with a 3-0 win over Hibernian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephen Robinson's side advanced to the next qualifying round of the Uefa Conference League with a 4-1 home win over Icelandic side Valur on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  St Mirren maintained their momentum as Roland Idowu fired them ahead three minutes into the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oisin Smyth headed the second in the 77th minute and bagged the third two minutes later, sending into Thursday's European tie against SK Brann in fine form. (AFP)

 US World No.1 Scottie Scheffler won gold at the men's Olympic golf competition on Sunday after matching the course record in the final round to pip crowd favourite Tommy Fleetwood of Britain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scheffler shot a nine-under-par round of 62 to finish the tournament on 19 under par, one shot ahead of Fleetwood who took silver.

  <br/>
  Japan's Hideki Matsuyama claimed the bronze medal a further shot back, improving on his tied fourth place on home soil in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic title adds to a spectacular year for Scheffler, who bagged his second Masters title in April as part of six tour successes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kristen Faulkner of the United States rode her way to a shock gold medal in the women’s cycling road race on Sunday at the Paris Olympics, while Hong Kong, China's Ceci Lee completed the challenging 158-kilometre course just a few minutes behind the leaders.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American surprised crowds as she finished in a little under four hours, beating some of the world’s best for the Olympic victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marianne Vos of the Netherlands, who won this event in the London Olympics, took home silver, while Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky secured the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo of Vos and Blanka Vas of Hungary were leading the pack with just a little under four kilometres left of the gruelling race, before Faulkner and Kopoecky began to accelerate towards the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American ended up moving ahead of the leading group, finishing with a time of 3 hours, 59 minutes and 23 seconds near the beautiful Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vos, Kopecky and Vas completed in a photo finish, 58 seconds behind the champion, but Vas unfortunately was a smidge behind and missed the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee completed the course in a remarkable 4 hours, 10 minutes and 47 seconds, just around eleven minutes behind the gold medalist. The SAR athlete ranked 64th overall out of 92 cyclists, with 14 unable to complete the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said after the race she felt she was in good condition, and the course was more difficult than she expected with many steep climbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while racing, she felt she had to toughen up so as not to waste the hard work the team and herself had put in in training. And she's glad she accomplished her goal of finishing the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather satisfied – because I just checked all the data, they were basically my best times," she told reporters. "So I would say it was a new level [of achievement]. So I hope I can build on this and perform even better in the upcoming race."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, 23, will be back in action on the track in the omnium on Sunday – the closing day of the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cyclists had to overcome 1,700 metres of climbing in nine ascents, passing by various landmarks in and around the host city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese Taipei badminton stars Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin successfully defended their men's doubles title on Sunday, defeating China's Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang 2-1 in a thrilling final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Taipei pair, unseeded at the tournament, jumped out to a 5-2 lead and maintained a three-point edge until midway through the first game against Liang and Wang, ranked number one in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides then traded 4-0 runs, before Chinese Taipei closed on a high to take the first game 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee and Wang kept it going to start the second game, taking an early 4-1 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Team China refused to give in, tying the score on several occasions before winning the game 21-18 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first part of the final game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than two and Chinese Taipei taking a 11-10 lead into the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a 12-11 edge, Chinese Taipei's Wang managed to save a couple of smashes from the floor before eventually conceding the point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the younger Liang and Wang shared a few smiles during breaks in the tight moments, they made several key mistakes, with Wang being called for a service violation that gave the Chinese Taipei pair a 16-13 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China managed to close the gap to 18-19, before the defending champions took control late to win the third game, 21-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who announced before the tournament his plans to retire next month after the Taipei Open, slumped to the floor alongside Wang in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two are the only badminton players from Chinese Taipei to ever win Olympic gold medals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi protesters demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resign clashed with government supporters on Sunday, with scores killed in one of the deadliest days since demonstrations began.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to step down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 77 people were killed on Sunday alone, including 14 police officers, with the rival sides battling with sticks and knives and security forces firing rifles, taking the total killed since protests began in July to at least 283.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said protesters attacked their officers, including storming a station in the northeastern town of Enayetpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terrorists attacked the police station and killed 11 policemen," said Bijoy Basak, a deputy inspector general.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in Dhaka reported hearing sustained crackles of gunfire after dark on Sunday, with protesters defying a nationwide curfew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 12 people were killed in the capital, police and doctors at hospitals said, several with bullet wounds, while 18 were killed in Bangladesh's northern district of Sirajganj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mobile internet was tightly restricted countrywide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In several cases, soldiers and police did not intervene to stem the protests, unlike the past month of rallies that repeatedly ended in deadly crackdowns. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Clashes have broken out at far-right rallies across Britain. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764725_1_20240804235106.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK authorities faced growing pressure on Sunday to put an end to England's worst rioting in 13 years after disturbances linked to child murders and involving far-riot agitators flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls earlier this week has spread to multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is posing a major test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest incident, trouble flared in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Sunday when masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 people were arrested on Saturday after skirmishes broke out at far-right rallies in numerous places, including Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police – injuring several officers – looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since the summer of 2011, when widespread rioting took place following the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're now seeing it (trouble) flooding across major cities and towns," said Tiffany Lynch of the Police Federation of England and Wales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the police have "all the resources they need" to deal with the disorder, as forces drafted in thousands of extra officers to try to stop the violence from spreading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Policing minister Diana Johnson told BBC News on Sunday that the rioting would "not be tolerated," while justice minister Shabana Mahmood has insisted that "the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbance in Rotherham marked the fifth day of skirmishes following Monday's frenzied knife attack at a Taylor Swift-theme dance party in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, who is accused of killing a six, seven, and nine-year-old, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the violence on supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Agitators have targeted mosques in Southport and in the northeastern English city of Sunderland, leading to hundreds of Islamic centres bolstering security amid fears for their worshippers' safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants have waved English and British flags while chanting slogans like "Stop the boats" – a reference to irregular migrants travelling to Britain from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-fascist demonstrators have held counter-rallies in many cities, including Leeds where they shouted, "Nazi scum off our streets," as the far-right protesters chanted, "You're not English any more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not all the gatherings have turned violent. A peaceful one in Aldershot, southern England, on Sunday saw participants hold placards that read "Stop the invasion" and "We're not far right, we're just right."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are fed up with being told you should be ashamed if you're white and working class but I'm proud white working class," 41-year-old Karina, who did not give her surname, said in Nottingham on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commentators have suggested that the demonstrators, spurred on by online influencers, may feel emboldened by the political ascendancy of anti-immigration elements in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, the Reform UK party led by Brexit cheerleader Nigel Farage captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carla Denyer, co-leader of the left-wing Green party said the unrest should be "a wake-up call to all politicians who have actively promoted or given in" to anti-immigration rhetoric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and has announced new measures to allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic completed his career Golden Slam as the 37-year-old Serb fought off Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in a magnificent Olympic men's singles final battle at Roland Garros on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After heartbreak in Beijing, London, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo, Djokovic simply would not be denied the one title that had eluded him for so long, winning 7-6(3) 7-6(2) in front of a enthralled crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top seed Djokovic delivered one of the finest performances of his career to deny Alcaraz and become only the fifth player to win all four singles Grand Slams and the Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest in which the first set alone lasted one hour 33 minutes as they wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz cracked first in the tiebreak and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, again Djokovic again found another gear, sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic roared to the sky and after shaking hands with Alcaraz he fell to his knees on the centre of the court before climbing into the crowd to be swamped by his family and team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz, who was denied the Olympic title to go with this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns, was in tears at the end. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Algeria's Kaylia Nemour became the first African gymnast to win an Olympic medal when she secured the gold with a breathtaking routine on the uneven bars at the Paris Games on Sunday that wowed the crowd in Bercy Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old's fast-paced routine featuring a number of complex release-and-catch manoeuvres delighted the crowd who came to support a gymnast who had previously represented France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans roared and jumped to their feet as soon as Nemour completed her dismount. She immediately broke down in tears as she handed Algeria their first medal of the Paris Olympics, with her performance scoring a staggering 15.700 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Qiu Qiyuan, the 2023 world champion, took silver after trailing Nemour by only 0.2 of a point. US gymnast Sunisa Lee claimed a second successive Olympic bronze on the apparatus with 14.800 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nina Derwael of Belgium, the champion at the Tokyo Games, finished 0.034 of a point off the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the other Chinese competitor Zhang Yihan started the event on the high bar, but during a release, she was not able to grip back the bar leading to a deduction. She immediately got back on the apparatus to finish the rest of her routine, but Zhang did take a few steps back during the dismount to earn her a score of 12.800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And there was a second gold medal for the Philippines on Sunday. Fresh from winning the men's individual floor event, Carlos Edriel Yulo won the gold medal in the men's vault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenian Artur Davtyan won the silver medal and Britain's Harry Hepworth took the bronze. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China sailor Nicholas Halliday on Sunday moved up one place in the men's dinghy after completing two more races at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Halliday came in 15th and 32nd place respectively on the fourth day of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old still has two more races to go on Monday, a day before the medal race in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is now ranked 24th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 136 net points, compared with 99 for Ireland’s Finn Lynch in 10th place.

  Liu Yang, who is the reigning Olympic champion in this event, earned a score of 15.300 with a difficulty of 6.400 and an executive score of 8.900 to land him the gold. The 29-year-old executed his movements with precision and stability, with just a small step and lean forward during the landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His Chinese counterpart Zou Jingyuan, who is dubbed the king of parallel bars, came behind with a score of 15.233, while Eleftherios Petrounias of Greece, who also won the bronze in this event at the Tokyo Games, completed the podium with an overall score of 15.100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said afterwards he was glad he was able to defend his Olympic crown, but he felt his performance "wasn't perfect enough".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Compared to Tokyo, psychologically and experience wise, I'm now more mature. But physically, I have had a lot more injuries and issues, and so this time, it's mainly about overcoming physical problems," he told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu added that he wanted to thank his family and the motherland for their support, while saying the gymnastics team had been united despite some regrets at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's gymnasts won the silver in the team event, after a slip up in the last round saw Japan leapfrog them for gold.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong on Sunday won gold in the men's singles at the Paris Olympics, beating his Swedish opponent 4-1 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who won silver at the Tokyo Games three years ago, fell behind early, with Sweden's Truls Moregard winning the opening game 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the second seed from China came roaring back, winning the next four games to clinch victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan took the second and third games 11-9 and the fourth game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fifth game, the 27-year-old Fan raced to a big 10-3 lead before Moregard saved five match points to make it 10-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan secured the next point to win the game and his first Olympics singles title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to compatriot Ma Long in the final in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is also China's 17th gold medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I have to believe in my ability and my strengths, to keep myself calm and be able to bring the match to my own pace," Fan said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did not do too well in the first game, as well as the opening of the second game. But I adjusted my mentality and played better later on."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the end of a dream run for Moregard, ranked 26th in the world, who upset the Chinese top seed Wang Chuqin in the round of 32 en route to the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Lebrun from France, who was beaten by Fan in the semi-finals, claimed bronze after defeating his Brazilian opponent, Hugo Calderano.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian rider Enea Bastianini completed the British MotoGP double for Ducati on Sunday by winning the grand prix, while Jorge Martin of Spain reclaimed the championship lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bastianini added to his sprint win on Saturday by racing past Martin inside the last two laps to claim victory, while the Spaniard finished second to move back above third-placed Francesco Bagnaia in the overall riders' championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ducati-Pramac's Martin arrived at Silverstone 10 points behind Bagnaia, who won the last four grand prix, but second-placed finishes in the sprint and grand prix meant he leapfrogged the Italian back into the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a weekend to forget for Bagnaia after he crashed out of the sprint and then ceded the early lead in the grand prix race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his compatriot Bastianini will have fond memories of Silverstone 2024 after producing a stunning late run to sprint to the double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bagnaia sprang into the lead from the start but was eventually reeled in on lap 14 by Martin, who had started on the second row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bastianini soon caught up with the two pacesetters and, after going past Bagnaia, he made his move on turn three of the 19th lap to fly ahead of Martin and sprint towards the chequered flag. (AFP)

    'HK people can delay retirement for a decade'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dickey Tang from JCI City says many retirees can still work and contribute. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764689_2_20240804194126.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO has called for a shift in how people view “middle age”, proposing a new age range of 50 to 75 and the city’s retirement age be adjusted accordingly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A recent survey it conducted of more than 400 people found that 90 percent were confident about their health at the age of 65.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eighty percent believed they would be able to continue working after retirement and expressed a desire to remain engaged in some form of work, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dickey Tang from the group JCI City noted the "new middle age" concept was brought up by the United Nation in a 2019 report, saying as more people stay healthy and energetic in their 50s, there's a need to give middle age a new definition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We based upon the living age and the retiring age for Hong Kong citizens and we found that people aged 50 until 75 actually are still healthy, including mentally and physically," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And they found themselves capable of doing more work and to serve their cities instead of retiring like usual elderly people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we define that from 50 to 75 years old, that's the new middle age for Hong Kong citizens.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang suggested the city’s retirement age be delayed for 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said he believes it would take time for society to embrace the idea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The society, the commercial world, the people, and education is not quite following this topic. So the pushing of this policy and the people's beliefs is quite laid back and delayed,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the changes need to start with educating people that age 60 or 65 is not an automatic endpoint to their work life, while also stressed that businesses need to adjust their employment policies to allow people to stay in the workforce for longer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Sunday expressed concern about a rise in the number of cyclists killed in traffic accidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of fatalities in the first six months of 2024 stood at seven, up from two in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief inspector of Police Traffic Branch (Road Safety), Lam Kai-sum, described the increase as worrying, adding that six of the victims did not wear a helmet or any protective gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enforcement action can help to lower the fatal accident figures," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So our enforcement aim is to reduce the number of fatalities... (and) to change the irresponsible behaviour of road users."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, 51 people were killed in traffic accidents in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said the number of those who died or were seriously injured dropped 42 percent to 392 from 675 a year ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sizzling temperatures did not prevent people from taking part in the annual Sport For All Day organised by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) on Sunday opened most of its leisure facilities across 18 districts for free public use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People needed to book in advance through the LCSD mobile app to use facilities like badminton, tennis and basketball courts, while most public swimming pools were open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman, surnamed Shum, went swimming at a pool in Wong Tai Sin at 6.45am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the ongoing Olympics Games motivated her to exercise more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially for us seniors, a lack of exercise is not good for our health. Watching the Olympics makes us want to stretch our legs and arms a bit, which is beneficial for our health,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mother, surnamed Hui, said there was not enough promotion. She said her son could have played basketball if she had learnt about the free facilities earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there are more free sports facilities, then people can have better chances of participating; and promotion, especially online, can be enhanced,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, Secretary for Sports, Culture and Tourism Kevin Yeung and Acting LCSD Director Winnie Chui visited a sports carnival at a stadium in Tai Po in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carnival featured booths promoting various sports like 3-on-3 basketball and Kabaddi, a fast-paced tag game from India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the visit, Lee said he hoped the Sports For All Day would encourage people to support and participate in sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we exercise for 30 minutes every day, we will be happy, healthy and relaxed," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's He Bingjiao on Sunday booked a place in the women's badminton singles final at the Paris Olympics after her semi-final opponent withdrew because of injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Spain's Carolina Marin, who won gold in the 2016 Rio Games, started off strong against the Chinese shuttler, taking the first game 21-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marin was leading 10-6 in the second when she appeared to have injured her right knee and collapsed to the floor in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She put on a knee brace and played two more points before deciding to retire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard limped off the court to a standing ovation from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her Chinese opponent told reporters that she felt very sad about what had happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was playing perfectly well and I was very passive," said He. "I wasn't thinking about the final at all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He advanced to the final to play world number one, An Seyoung from South Korea, who beat Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in the other semis. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Transplant Sports Association said organ donors have decreased by 60 percent in the SAR compared to 10 years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Chau Ka-foon, founder and honorary chairperson of the association, said one of the reasons is because of Covid, during which not only the number of donors decreased due to deaths, but hospitals closed down and staff were infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau said in a survey that they carried out, many people indicated they're willing to donate their organs, but there are different reasons why they have not come forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not unwilling, they only ignore the necessity of organ donation, maybe they are not in contact with other patients who are in need, so they are not aware of their existence," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau added that Hong Kong people are very busy, and they don't go online and register as organ donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also said it will host a sports day for patients in October, as part of efforts to help with their recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One kidney inflammation patient, Peony Choi, is now a badminton athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One year before my kidney transplant, I had to stop all my work, I had to stay at home, just waiting. And you never know when you can have the kidney and at that time my strength was so weak I cannot do anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said playing badminton has helped her regain her strength after the organ transplant.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday unveiled plans to visit Europe, the United States, Australia and the Middle East, in the second half of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On his official blog, the finance minister said the visits aim to strengthen ties with traditional markets, as well as to explore new markets and capital sources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that Hong Kong has a strong international presence in finance, business, culture and people-to-people exchanges, making it a vital player in global trade and resilient in the face of challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said Hong Kong's overall economy remains relatively stable and continues to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He mentioned that key drivers of the economy like exports and investment spendings both continued to rise, supporting a 3.3 percent year-on-year economic growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But changes in tourist and consumer spending patterns, along with a strong Hong Kong dollar are bringing some pressure to private consumption, Chan added.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vivian Kong says she’s going to start a charity to help kids pursue sports. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764658_1_20240804101145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong has announced her retirement from professional fencing, bidding farewell to her career as a full-time athlete.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made history at the Paris Olympics Games, clinching the first ever gold medal in the individual epee event for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old’s résumé includes three Olympic appearances, two world championship bronze medals, as well as six Asian Games medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m so grateful to have had the chance to dedicate almost 20 years of my life to fencing and thank you for being a part of this journey,” she wrote in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After competing in my third Olympics, I have decided to take a break from professional fencing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she’s going to start a new career and launch her own charity to help kids find joy and playfulness in sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I will miss my fencing family so so much, but once a fencer, always a fencer,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, said Kong had informed him of her decision earlier, saying he understood it but was sad to hear the news.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the decision was made after long-time consideration and family discussions. I wasn't surprised when she told me about the decision,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She is such a high performance athlete who has just won an Olympic gold medal and is at the peak of her athletic career. This is something many athletes can only dream of… I’m really sad to see her go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng said that Kong’s departure will definitely have an impact on the fencing team, but added that he remains optimistic about the team's future development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patrick Yung, a surgeon who performed two knee operations on Kong, said he is behind the Olympic gold medallist's decision to hang up her sword.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong suffered serious anterior cruciate ligament injuries in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think those injuries suffered by Vivian over the past years did affect her decision for retirement or not," Yung, who chairs the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at Chinese University, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But over the past few years, it's not just physical demands, [there's] also very high mental stress for a lot of Olympians representing Hong Kong. That's why I am not surprised to see not just Vivian, but even others, would like to take a break, [go on] holiday, or do something else, so that they can recover physically and mentally."

    Hezbollah launches 'dozens' of rockets at Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Flares of the Israeli army light up the sky of the area bordering Lebanon amid ongoing cross-border clashes between Israeli troops and Lebanon's Hezbollah fighters. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764654_1_20240804090901.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched dozens of Katyusha rockets at Israel, the latest in a series of attacks it says is in support of the Palestinian people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Lebanese group said its latest attack, on Beit Hillel in northern Israel, was in response to Israel's attacks on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Middle East tensions soared on Saturday as Iran and its allies readied their response to the assassination of Hamas's political leader, blamed on Israel, spurring fears of a regional war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel ally the United States said it would move warships and fighter jets to the region, while Western governments called on their citizens to leave Lebanon -- where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based -- and airlines cancelled flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel on Saturday again traded fire with Hezbollah, carried out a deadly raid in the occupied West Bank, and struck a school compound in Gaza City in an attack that the Hamas-ruled territory's civil defence agency said killed at least 17 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous schools turned into displacement shelters have been hit across Gaza in recent weeks, with Israel insisting the facilities had been used by militants. Hamas denied using civilian infrastructure for military activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was buried on Friday in Qatar, where he had been based. Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of carrying out the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran said on Saturday it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pentagon said it was bolstering its military presence in the Middle East to protect US personnel and defend Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln would be deployed, as well as additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers and a new fighter squadron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden, at his beach home in Delaware, was asked by reporters if he thought Iran would stand down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope so," he said. "I don't know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the northern Israeli settlement of Beit Hillel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was in response to an Israeli attack on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in southern Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, including a 17-year-old from Deir Siriane. (AFP)

 The Olympic Games reached the halfway stage on Saturday, with an unexpected gold in tennis capping another day of success for Team China.

   Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has claimed the biggest victory of her budding career, clinching a gold medal on her Olympic debut by defeating Croatian veteran Donna Vekic in the women's final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sixth-seeded Zheng made a name for herself after upsetting world number one Iga Swiatek in the last four. The 21-year-old carried that momentum into the showdown at Roland Garros, leading Vekic from wire to wire for the 6-2, 6-3 victory.

            <br/>
            Stephanie Au, Siobhan Haughey, Natalie Kan and Karen Tam clocked a time of four minutes and 3.56 seconds, nearly two seconds short of the Hong Kong record the four hold, and more than a second slower than their Paris entry time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Femke Bol ran a stunning last lap to lead the Netherlands to victory in the Olympic 4x400 metres mixed relay on Saturday, glorious redemption for the 24-year-old who fell just before the line in the same race at last year's world championships.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bol got the baton in fourth place, around 20 metres behind the leading Americans, but ate up the ground in a spectacular 47.93-second leg before passing American Kaylyn Brown just before the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch team of Eugene Omalla, Lieke Klaver, Isaya Klein Ikkink and Bol clocked three minutes 7.43 seconds, missing the world record time the Americans set in Friday's heats by just two-hundredths of a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Julien Alfred delivered a brilliant gun-to-tape performance to win the women’s 100 metres final and claim Saint Lucia’s first-ever Olympic medal, though the controversial absence of Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce left a cloud over the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alfred made her usual slick start and remained clear in heavy rain on a sodden track to come home in a national record 10.72 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion and race favourite Sha'Carri Richardson took silver in 10.87 but the American never really threatened and her compatriot Melissa Jefferson claimed bronze in 10.92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Double Olympic champion Fraser-Pryce, appearing in her fifth Olympics, was listed as 'Did Not Start' shortly before the semi-finals and her lane remained empty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media footage later emerged of her and Jamaican team members arguing with officials who appeared to be refusing to let her in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fraser-Pryce was heard saying "they've changed the rules, we always come through this gate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Athletics said it was still awaiting official confirmation of the reason for her absence from the Jamaican team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norway's Markus Rooth captured a shock gold medal in the men's decathlon after defending champion Damian Warner's title defence ended when he failed to clear a height in the pole vault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Thea LaFond made history for her Caribbean island nation of Dominica by winning gold in the triple jump to claim the country's first ever Olympic medal.
  <br/>

  Jamaica's Shanieka Ricketts took then silver and the United States' Jasmine Moore claimed bronze. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Katie Ledecky won a record-equalling career ninth gold medal at the Paris Olympics by claiming an unprecedented fourth women's 800 metres freestyle title on Saturday, while Team China added a relay silver to their collection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American great touched the wall in 8:11.04 at La Defense Arena, 1.25 seconds ahead of Australian silver medallist Ariarne Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paige Madden took bronze for the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ledecky's ninth gold from four Games gives her a share of the all-time record for female Olympians with former Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also joined fellow American great Michael Phelps as the only swimmer to win four Olympic golds in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States won the mixed 4x100 metres medley relay gold with a world record time, as France's Leon Marchand suffered his first defeat in a final at the meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China took the silver and Australia the bronze. France, with four-gold hero Marchand swimming the second leg, finished fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winning time of three minutes 37.43 seconds smashed the record of 3:37.58 set by previous champions Britain at the 2021 Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Canada's Summer McIntosh won the women's 200 metres individual medley in an Olympic record time for her third swimming gold of the Games and fourth medal overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kate Douglass of the United States won the silver and Australian Kaylee McKeown the bronze after US swimmer Alex Walsh was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold completed a medley double for the 17-year-old McIntosh, who won the 400 IM last Monday. She also won the 200 butterfly on Thursday and took silver in the 400 freestyle on the opening Saturday. (Reuters)

    Far-right protesters clash with police in UK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An anti-racism campaign group has identified more than 30 events planned for Saturday and Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764637_1_20240804031024.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right protesters clashed with British police during tense rallies on Saturday as unrest linked to disinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls spread across the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The violence, which has seen scores of arrests across England and put Britain's Muslim community on edge, presents the biggest challenge yet of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's month-old premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also put hard-right agitators in the spotlight at a time when anti-immigration elements are enjoying some electoral success in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators threw chairs, flares and bricks at officers in the northwestern English city of Liverpool, while scuffles between police and protesters broke out in nearby Manchester.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merseyside Police said "a number of officers have been injured as they deal with serious disorder" in Liverpool city centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported that protesters smashed the windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants in the northeastern city of Hull. Police said three officers had been injured and four people arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Belfast, Northern Ireland, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islam group and an anti-racism rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Leeds, northern England, around 150 people carrying English flags chanted, "You're not English any more" while counter-protesters shouted "Nazi scum off our streets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposing groups of protesters also faced off in the central city of Nottingham and Bristol in the southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The skirmishes marked the fourth day of unrest in several towns and cities following Monday's frenzied knife attack in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, charged with several counts of murder and attempted murder over the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rudakubana is accused of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts would "face the full force of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And reacting to Saturday's clashes, he said there was "no excuse" for the violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After talks with senior ministers he "reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe," said a statement from his office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence started late on Tuesday in Southport itself, where a mob threw bricks at a mosque. That prompted hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police blamed supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest then rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later, where 111 people were arrested outside Starmer's Downing Street residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, 10 people were arrested and four officers required hospital treatment following a riot in the northeastern English city of Sunderland in which at least one car was set on fire and a shop looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob also torched a police station and attacked a mosque.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder," Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall told reporters on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events planned for Saturday and Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were advertised on far-right social media channels as "enough is enough" anti-immigration rallies. Anti-fascism groups have staged numerous counter-protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, demonstrators attending a regular pro-Palestinian march appeared undeterred by a separate anti-immigration protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents told me not to come today but I am from here. The UK is my home," said 24-year-old student Meraaj Harun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer this week announced new measures that will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour politicians have accused Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage of stoking the trouble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, his anti-immigration Reform UK party captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party. (AFP)

    Thousands in Venezuela protest Maduro's victory claim

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado's appearance delighted the crowd. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764634_1_20240804022718.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people, led by a top opposition figure, gathered across Venezuela on Saturday to protest the widely disputed reelection of President Nicolas Maduro, as his supporters responded to his own call for competing rallies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado thrilled supporters in Caracas when she made a surprise appearance in a truck bearing a banner reading "Venezuela has won!" after spending several days in hiding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado had backed the candidacy of Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia after she herself was banned from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Backers cried out "Freedom!" as her truck passed by on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never been so strong as today," Machado told the crowd, adding that "the regime has never been weaker... it has lost all legitimacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro also called on his supporters to turn out for "the mother of all marches" later in the afternoon. He accused the opposition of plotting attacks against security forces during their rallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eleven civilians reportedly have died and more than 1,000 have been detained in the protests that erupted after the country's CNE election authority, loyal to Maduro, on Friday proclaimed him the winner with 52 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Gonzalez Urrutia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that result has been rejected by countries including the United States, Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Uruguay. They say available results show the opposition candidate to be the clear winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered the expulsion of diplomats from some countries questioning his victory. Argentine diplomats who reached Buenos Aires on Saturday said power had been cut to their embassy, as hooded police kept guard outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 61-year-old Maduro has reacted fiercely to the widespread international criticism, describing allegations of vote fraud as a "trap" orchestrated by Washington to justify "a coup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has led the oil-rich, cash-poor country since 2013, presiding over a GDP drop of 80 percent that pushed more than seven million of once-wealthy Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts blame economic mismanagement and US sanctions for the collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia did not show up to a hearing at the Supreme Court after Maduro requested the tribunal investigate and certify the election result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, other opposition candidates summoned to the hearing called for a detailed vote count to be made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has launched a website with copies of 84 percent of ballots cast, showing an easy win for Gonzalez Urrutia. The government claims these are forged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado, who was barred from running herself, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she was in hiding and "fearing for my life," along with other opposition leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO Foro Penal reported 11 dead in protests on Monday and Tuesday as angry Venezuelans took to the streets, and Machado said at least 20 people had been killed. Officials said one soldier died as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crackdown has sparked fear among opposition supporters, with memories still fresh of a wave of repression under the Maduro government in 2017 that left some 100 people dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have dead, wounded, detainees, missing people... People know it. They are afraid," Katiusca Camargo, an activist in the Petare slum in eastern Caracas, said on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday there was "overwhelming evidence" that Gonzalez Urrutia had won the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke with Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia on Friday, expressing "his concern for their safety and well-being" and congratulating Gonzalez Urrutia "for receiving the most votes," the State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico urged an "impartial verification" of the result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro's previous reelection, in 2018, was rejected by dozens of Latin American countries as well as the United States and European Union member states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoys loyalty from the military leadership, electoral bodies, courts and other state institutions, as well as the backing of Russia, China and Cuba. (AFP)

    Surging Harris, Trump spar over debate dates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kamala Harris's campaign communications director says Donald Trump is "running scared." Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764633_1_20240804013010.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris's campaign branded Donald Trump "scared" on Saturday after he proposed to change the presidential debate schedule ahead of a rally in Georgia where he will try to halt the vice president's surging momentum in her bid to become America's first woman president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an overnight post on his Truth Social app, Trump said he was willing to debate Harris on the conservative Fox News network on September 4, while declining to participate in a previously scheduled debate on ABC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump pitched the idea before going to a rally in Atlanta, where he will gather supporters in the same arena where Harris addressed an excited crowd of some 10,000 just this Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said he had "agreed" to the debate plan with Fox. And he said it would take place in Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state in the US presidential electoral system – in front of a live audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris campaign dismissed this as "games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out," Harris's campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. "He needs to... show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal to confront Harris on a network that has long supported him was the latest Trump effort to recapture the initiative in a campaign that had been entirely focused on a rematch against 81-year-old Joe Biden, until he dramatically dropped his reelection bid on July 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Harris, 59, has reenergised the Democratic base almost overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has raked in donations, reassembled the team behind Barack Obama's two historic election victories, and neutralised the solid lead that 78-year-old Trump had built against Biden in opinion polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, she secured the official Democratic nomination, backed by near unanimous party support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris is due imminently to announce her vice presidential pick, with the popular governor of key state Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner. On Tuesday, she is set to launch a countrywide tour with her yet-to-be-named running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, Trump will be joined by his own vice presidential pick, Senator JD Vance, at the rally in Georgia – another battleground state that will help decide who wins the Electoral College majority on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lost narrowly to Biden there in 2020 and the state was at the centre of his unprecedented attempts to overturn the results of the election and refusal to accept defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The size of Harris's rally on Tuesday was a warning sign to the Trump campaign, which has long touted its ability to draw thousands of passionate supporters, in contrast to Biden's usually meagre crowds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is a remarkable turnaround in a campaign where Trump had been appearing to gather force while Biden – hurt by a disastrous debate performance in June and mounting voter concerns over his mental acuity – was steadily slipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris's rapid entry has left the Trump campaign scrambling – and Trump now the oldest presidential nominee in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adding to the changed dynamics, Harris is vying to become the first woman president and the first of black and Indian bi-racial heritage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump drew gasps at a convention of black journalists this week when he claimed that Harris, who has identified closely with her black roots all her life, was only pretending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has claimed the biggest victory of her budding career, clinching a gold medal on her Olympic debut by defeating Croatian veteran Donna Vekic in the women's final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sixth-seeded Zheng made a name for herself after upsetting world number one Iga Swiatek in the last four on Thursday. The 21-year-old carried that momentum into the showdown at Roland Garros, leading Vekic from wire to wire for the 6-2, 6-3 victory in one hour and 45 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After converting on her first match point, China's top woman dropped to the ground and punched her fists in the air as a large Chinese contingent in the stands erupted in cheers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng is the first Chinese woman to win an Olympic singles gold, and to achieve the feat on her debut made it all the more special.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compatriots Li Ting and Sun Tiantian also struck gold in 2004 in the women's doubles, while Yan Zi and Zheng Jie took home bronze at the same event four years later in Beijing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgium's Remco Evenepoel made history on Saturday in the men's cycling road race, though Hong Kong's Vincent Lau dropped out almost three-quarters of the way through one of the most gruelling of all Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel, who won the time trial a week earlier, became the first man to claim gold in both road cycling disciplines, despite having to swap bikes four kilometres from the finish because of a mechanical failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He took control 15 kilometres from the end of the 273km race around Paris and surrounding areas to cross the finish line near the Eiffel Tower one minute and 11 seconds ahead of Valentin Madouas of France. Another home athlete, Christophe Laporte, completed the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau pushed hard and cycled beyond the 200-kilometre mark, but he unfortunately couldn’t keep up with the peloton, becoming one of 13 participants who failed to complete the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was disappointed he could not reach the finishing line, but he was excited to have raced alongside some all-time greats of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Performance-wise, I think I could do better. But the experience, I think, it's the best you can get. A cycling race in France, it doesn't get bigger than this," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing all the fans on every climb, shouting 'allez, allez, allez', it's every cyclist's dream to have that crowd on a climb cheering you on. I think the experience is very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 90 cyclists in the pack had to overcome 2,800 metres of climbing on 13 ascents throughout the course, which passed many Parisian landmarks before winding into the French countryside.

    Rangers held by Hearts on opening day of SPL season

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rangers' Cyriel Dessers hits the bar from close range and another chance goes begging. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764626_1_20240804002000.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rangers were forced to settle for a disappointing 0-0 draw against Hearts in the opening game of the new Scottish Premiership season on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With Scottish champions Celtic starting their title defence at home to Kilmarnock on Sunday, Rangers had an opportunity to issue a statement of intent to their title rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Philippe Clement's side produced an erratic display at Tynecastle characterised by poor finishing and a lack of cohesion in midfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was exactly the kind of concerning display Rangers fans had feared after Clement sounded a warning on the eve of Rangers' latest bid to win their first title since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belgian took over from Michael Beale last October and sparked an upturn in form that included a League Cup triumph and briefly brought them back into title contention before Celtic pulled away in the closing stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just 24 hours after agreeing to extend his contract until 2028, Clement hardly inspired confidence when he admitted before kick-off that his squad was "probably not stronger" than last season and might need several months to get up to speed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rangers endured a difficult close-season marred by unconvincing friendly performances, debatable transfer activity and construction delays that meant their renovated Ibrox stadium was not available for the start of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Clement's cautious tone appeared prophetic as Rangers struggled to keep Hearts at bay in a frantic start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland striker Lawrence Shankland, who scored 24 league goals last season, started for Hearts amid speculation over a potential move to Rangers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shankland took just 60 seconds to underline his quality with a stinging strike that forced a good stop from Jack Butland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Rangers goalkeeper was called into action again moments later to repel James Penrice's strike after a slick move carved open the visitors' defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rangers were on the ropes and Yan Dhanda's curler ricocheted off the crossbar as Hearts pressure mounted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Barron made his Rangers debut after joining from Aberdeen, but Robin Propper, who signed from FC Twente on Thursday, was denied his Rangers debut due to paperwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barron was inches away from putting Rangers ahead against the run of play but the midfielder's low drive was clawed to safety by Zander Clark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyriel Dessers squandered an even better chance for Rangers when the striker scooped over from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hearts were just as profligate as Barrie McKay blazed over from Dhanda's defence-splitting pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dhanda appealed in vain for a penalty after his cross hit Barron on the hand, but Rangers finally had some momentum and Clark saved well from Dessers just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dessers missed another golden opportunity early in the second half, the striker's luck completely out as he hit the bar from close range and watched in disbelief as the rebound cannoned off the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vaclav Cerny came off the bench for his Rangers debut after signing on loan from Wolfsburg, before Clark's superb save stopped Tom Lawrence's half-volley dipping into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Held in check for long periods by the Rangers defence, Shankland managed to wriggle clear for a near-post effort that Butland parried away, but neither side could find a winner.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike struck a school compound in Gaza City on Saturday, killing at least 17 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are 17 martyrs and several wounded due to Israeli bombardment on Hamama school," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. The Israeli military confirmed the strike, saying it had hit a Hamas command and control centre located inside the compound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bassal said the compound was housing Palestinians displaced from their homes in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the compound was being used by Hamas militants to manufacture weapons, adding it was a "hiding place for Hamas terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilian facilities as command and control centres or to hide their commanders and militants. The Palestinian group denies the accusation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held hostage in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's withering military campaign has killed at least 39,550 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles won the vault final on Saturday to clinch her third gold medal of the Paris Games, dominating the competition with her signature Biles II vault to beat Brazilian silver medallist Rebeca Andrade with American Jade Carey taking bronze.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biles soared high into the air as she performed her explosive Yurchenko double pike for a massive score of 15.700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American also impressed with her second effort. She powered down the runway and launched into the Cheng vault, which incorporates a round-off, half-on entry with a one-and-a-half twisting flip to finish. She earned 14.900.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old claimed a comfortable victory at the Bercy Arena with an average of 15.300 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles arrived in Paris as the world's most decorated gymnast and she has reached new heights by claiming gold medals in all three women's events contested so far in Paris. She now has 10 Olympic medals overall, with seven of them being gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She led the US team to the top of the podium in the team final before claiming a second all-around Olympic title two days ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles can add to her tally further when she competes in the balance beam and women's floor finals on Monday. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan reached the top of the podium at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's badminton pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan on Saturday won an Olympic gold in Paris, defeating compatriots Liu Shenshu and Tan Ning in straight games for the women's doubles title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan – the third seed at the Paris Games – took a 20-17 lead in the first game, but the top seeded Chen and Jia saved four game points to win 22-20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing that their opponents' confidence was wavering, Chen and Jia rushed to a 9-2 edge to start the second game, before leading 11-7 at intermission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan then cut the deficit to bring the score to 11-13, but that was the closest they managed to get, as the top shuttlers won the second game 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was China's first gold in the women's doubles since 2012, and sixth since the event became a fixture at the Olympics in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia had previously come up short in Tokyo, finishing second on the podium after losing to Indonesians Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu.
