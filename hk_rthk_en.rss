<div class="itemFullText">
 Three projectiles hit a merchant vessel off Yemen's rebel-held port city of Hodeida on Wednesday, causing a fire onboard and leaving the ship without engine power, a British maritime security agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Athens identified the vessel as the Greek-flagged Sounion oil tanker, and Greece's Maritime Affairs Minister Christos Stylianides condemned "a serious threat" to international shipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tanker was "struck by two unidentified projectiles before being hit by a third," said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its crew earlier exchanged fire with two small vessels, one with three to five people onboard while the second carried around 10, said the agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a fire onboard and the vessel has lost engine power," UKMTO said, adding that "the vessel is drifting and not under command."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the UKMTO and the Greek port authority said there were no reports of casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson for the port authority said the Sounion, an oil products tanker owned by Greek shipping company Delta Tankers, carried a crew of 25 people, mostly Filipinos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had departed from Iraq and was destined for a port near Athens where many refineries are based, the Greek port authority said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the ship could have been hit either by missiles or drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attack came as the Iran-backed Houthi rebels keep up a nine-month-old campaign against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that they say is in support of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stylianides in a statement "condemned the attack, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and a serious threat to the security of international shipping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such acts put the lives of seafarers at risk and disrupt the free movement of goods along vital maritime routes," the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate incident south of the Yemeni port city of Aden on Wednesday, another ship reported three explosions in the water in close proximity, UKMTO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew are reported safe and vessel is proceeding to the next port of call, the agency added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis' campaign of rocket and drone attacks has severely disrupted maritime traffic through the Red Sea, which normally accounts for up to 12 percent of world trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea now have security teams on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and Britain have responded to the attacks by striking Houthi targets in Yemen since January, but it has done little to deter the rebels. (AFP)

    Israel kills Fatah leader accused of 'terror attacks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel killed a senior member of the Palestinian Fatah movement in Lebanon on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating attacks in the West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response, the slain militant's Fatah party accused Israel of seeking to "ignite a regional war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khalil Maqdah was killed in a strike on his car in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, according to Fatah and a Lebanese security source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said an air force "aircraft struck the terrorist Khalil Hussein Khalil Al-Maqdah in the area of Sidon in southern Lebanon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said Maqdah was the brother of Mounir Maqdah, who heads the Lebanese branch of Fatah's armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and accused them both of "directing terror attacks and smuggling weapons" to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged that the pair "collaborate on behalf of" Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack marks the first such reported attack on a senior member of Fatah, the movement led by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, in more than 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement following the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fatah said Maqdah had been killed "in a cowardly assassination carried out by ... Zionist (Israeli) warplanes on Sidon," describing him as "one of the leaders" of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Lebanon, the movement's armed wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said Maqdah had "a central role" in "supporting the Palestinian people and its resistance" during the Gaza war and an "important role in supporting resistance cells" for years in the West Bank. (AFP)

    Indian PM Modi begins landmark Poland, Ukraine visit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Narendra Modi pays his respects at the memorial to the 'Good Maharaja', who sheltered Polish children during World War II. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767123_1_20240822003604.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi launched on Wednesday his historic trip to Poland and Ukraine, where the premier has pledged to campaign for a peaceful resolution of Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to make a Ukraine trip and first in 45 years to travel to Poland, Kyiv's staunch ally that is a key transit for foreign leaders heading to its war-torn neighbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda on Thursday, as well as with Indian nationals living in the Central European country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This visit will add momentum to the India-Poland friendship and benefit the people of our nations," Modi said on X upon landing in Warsaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Modi commemorated an Indian maharaja who sheltered Polish children during World War II, before laying flowers at a war memorial and delivering a speech to the Indian community in Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland "needs a lasting partnership with India," deputy Polish Prime Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters before Modi's visit, adding that economic ties would also be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has trodden a delicate balance between maintaining India's historically warm ties with Russia while courting closer security partnerships with Western nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His government has avoided explicit condemnations of Russia's 2022 operation in Ukraine, instead urging both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region," Modi said in a statement published on Wednesday before his departure for Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Kyiv, Modi will hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and "share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "India has consistently advocated for diplomacy and dialogue to reach a negotiated settlement," Indian foreign ministry official Tanmaya Lal said before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky announced on Monday that "a number of documents are also expected to be signed" during the meeting with Modi, whose previous diplomatic efforts drew condemnation from Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, hours after Russia pummelled multiple cities across Ukraine, Modi visited Moscow and was pictured hugging Putin at his residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also visited Russia in 2019 and hosted Putin in New Delhi two years later, weeks before Moscow began its offensive against Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India has largely shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia and abstained on UN resolutions targeting the Kremlin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Russia's fight with Ukraine has also had a human cost for India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi has pushed Moscow to return several of its citizens who signed up for "support jobs" with the Russian military but were later sent to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least five Indian soldiers have been killed in the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani man appeared in court on Wednesday to face charges of cyber terrorism after allegedly spreading disinformation on his clickbait website thought to have fuelled anti-immigration riots in Britain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Farhan Asif was accused of publishing an article on his Channel3Now website falsely claiming that a Muslim asylum seeker was suspected in a deadly knife attack on children in the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK authorities have blamed online misinformation for sparking days of riots which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers as well as police officers and other properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a 31-year-old software engineer with no journalism credentials, apart from running the Channel3Now website, which served as a source of income for him," a senior official at Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Initial investigations indicate that his sole intent was to make money through clickbait content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asif appeared at a Lahore district court on Wednesday charged with cyber terrorism and was remanded to custody for one day, the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article with the false information was published on Channel3Now just hours after the attack and was widely cited in viral social media posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen English towns and cities saw unrest and riots after the July 29 knife attack that killed three girls during a dance class in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder. (AFP)

    Germany goalkeeper Neuer retires from internationals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, a 2014 World Cup winner, announced his retirement from international football on Wednesday at the age of 38.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayern Munich veteran Neuer played 124 matches for Germany, captaining his country 61 times. His final appearance came in the quarter-final loss to eventual champions Spain at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer wrote on social media that although he was tempted to play until the 2026 World Cup, he was "convinced that now is the right time to take this step."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He shone at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and was named as the tournament's best goalkeeper as Germany won the trophy for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer revealed he had made the announcement after discussions with his family, as well as a comprehensive conversation with Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he planned to "concentrate fully" on playing for Bayern, with whom he has won two Champions Leagues and 11 Bundesliga titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season's Champions League final will take place at Munich's Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer broke his leg in a skiing accident in December 2022 and only returned to the Germany squad just ahead of Euro 2024 on home soil, reclaiming his role as first choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great time which shaped me and of which I am very proud," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winning the World Cup title in 2014 and the special atmosphere during the European Championship at home this year are highlights for which I am extremely grateful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was an honour for me to be captain of our national team until 2023. I loved wearing the Germany jersey."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer follows fellow 2014 World Cup winners Thomas Mueller and Toni Kroos, who both played at Euro 2024, into international retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, current Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan, who missed the 2014 World Cup campaign through injury, also announced he had played his last game at international level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A product of the Schalke academy in his home town of Gelsenkirchen, Neuer made his international debut in 2009 and has more caps than any other Germany goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany won 81 of the 124 matches Neuer played in, and he kept 51 clean sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The retirement clears the way for long-time back-up Marc Andre ter Stegen of Barcelona, who is expected to take over from the Bayern captain as Germany's number one. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Divers searching for six missing people following the sinking of a superyacht off Sicily in a storm have found two bodies, sources told media.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery brings the confirmed death toll to three. It was not immediately clear who had been found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The missing include British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and the chairman of Morgan Stanley International Jonathan Bloomer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen people survived, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster. (Agencies)

  “The investigation revealed that the chairman of the listed company and other individuals had allegedly falsified business documents and accounting records of the company's subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau, while the company's trade receivables totalling over MOP$113 million (about HK$110 million) were reduced,” the ICAC said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, the individuals concerned had also allegedly used false documents and accounting records to conceal the misappropriation of the company's funds over HK$9 million.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said it had teamed up with the Securities and Futures Commission to search six premises earlier this week and arrested the seven individuals involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees had allegedly committed the offence of agent using documents with intent to deceive his principal under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau Police also searched the company's offices in Macau and interviewed individuals as part of their investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body added the investigation was ongoing and it would not make further comments on the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A delegation from Polytechnic University has won nine awards at the Silicon Valley International Inventions Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A cardiac monitoring device that's a tiny, light, wireless and wearable patch garnered two awards, including the semi-grand prize and a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Zheng Zijian, who led the research team behind the patch, said the device is as accurate as the machines used in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our permeable electronic skin, [electrocardiogram] electronic skin is the first of its kind that allows ICU-grade accuracy for long-term wearable… The permeability is superb, so that you can allow for long-term and accurate monitoring,” Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So for the next phase, we're working with the industries, venture capitalists, and trying to commercialise our technologies.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A nighttime brace designed to help teenagers with scoliosis earned a special prize issued by the Korea Invention Promotion Association, as well as a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Joanne Yip, who led the research team involved, said the brace could be commercialised next year and could sell for about HK$3,000 to HK$4,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our product, this nighttime brace, is the first one in the world using textile and soft robotics to provide early intervention for the patients with scoliosis. I can say this product is actually designed based on the patient's will, that we want to give them a more comfortable, but yet effective treatment,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are recruiting patients in Hong Kong for the clinical trial… We want to commercialise next year and because I think the cost is not too high, so it's affordable for patients and their families.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  University vice-president Professor Christopher Chao said this was the second time PolyU had joined the technology exhibition in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the main purpose was to help the research teams and startups understand the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They need to understand more about the market and also the investment ecosystem more, otherwise all these startup companies may not be able to be successful. In fact, this is sometimes even more important than the technology itself,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday announced that its first-half net profit for 2024 dropped three percent year-on-year to HK$6.13 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's bourse operator said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$4.36 per share, three percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, HKEX said net income for the second quarter, covering April to June, rose nine percent to HK$3.16 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were supported by the growth in trading and clearing fees from higher volumes across the cash, derivatives and commodities markets, according to HKEX's earnings statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKEX's Chief Executive Bonnie Chan said sentiment appears to be on the mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, while macro-environment uncertainties persist, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year," she added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Smart vending machines along harbourfront in service

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six smart vending machines along the Wan Chai harbourfront are now in operation, selling grab-and-go snacks and beverages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following a soft launch on Wednesday, people can order ice cream, popcorn, candyfloss and drinks from the self-service, unattended machines between 7am and 11pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are hoping to provide such services round-the-clock in future, but did not offer a timetable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the soft launch period, we will monitor the visitor flow and see if there is anything that we can do better elsewhere along the harbour," said the Development Bureau's senior engineer, Phoebe Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brendan, 6, was among the first to try the machines and told RTHK: "I just got ice cream and popcorn... I think they need like 100 kinds of flavours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist surnamed Bleazard said the prices for food and beverages, which are between HK$18 and HK$35, were reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The vending machine is good because you don't have to talk to anyone. You just choose what you want and you pay and you go,” he said. "Otherwise, you have to wait for the person, and hope they're open."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kiosks are part of an initiative announced in this year's budget to introduce food and beverages, retail and entertainment services on a pilot basis at “suitable harbourfront locations”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is hoping to introduce similar facilities along the promenade in East Kowloon by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Sports Institute is reviewing a funding scheme for athletes, with an outcome expected early next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as debate continues as to whether the city's athletes earn enough to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has been working to provide a more supportive environment to our athletes, so they can better train, compete and enjoy a good career path after retirement," Lee said at a reception for SAR Olympians at government headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Authorities have been in close contact with the sports institute and sports associations to strengthen the subsidy schemes and training regimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on Facebook afterwards, Lee said Hong Kong is proud of every Olympian, "whether they won a medal or not".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foil fencer Ryan Choi reignited the debate on athlete funding on Tuesday when he posted details of an unnamed teammate's income and expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fencer received a monthly allowance of HK$7,130 while having to shoulder costs for competing overseas, including air fares, accommodation and registration fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only want to shed light on the situation faced by some of my teammates, and hope they'll receive better treatment," he said in another online post on Wednesday, before removing both posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the reception, the president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, Timothy Fok, said more events are in the pipeline to make sure the athletes remain in the limelight after the Paris Games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday started an anti-subsidy investigation into certain dairy products imported from the European Union (EU), according to the Ministry of Commerce.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The probe will cover imported dairy products including fresh cheese and curd, blue cheese, and some milk and cream, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will look at a number of subsidies under the EU's common agricultural policy and should be concluded within a year, but could be extended for six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The application to launch the investigation came from the China Dairy Association and China Dairy Industry Association, the ministry added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe joins a number of other pending Chinese inquiries into EU trade practices, including an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trade ties between China and the EU have suffered after the EU earlier announced tariffs for Chinese-made electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the European Commission said it planned to impose five-year import duties of up to 36 percent on Chinese electric cars, unless Beijing can offer an alternative solution to a trade row over state subsidies. (Agencies)

    Housing Society to put rents up by 10 percent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced 10 percent rent increases for residents of the 20 public estates it operates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each household will see a rise of at least HK$230 per month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes come into effect in October, but tenants will be given a three-month waiver given the current economic situation of Hong Kong, the society said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The public housing body is envisaging a revenue loss of almost HK$24 million due to the waiver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The society stressed that in increasing rents, it has taken into account how much tenants can afford to pay, along with its financial needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it has incurred an operational loss over the past two years due to rising maintenance costs and it expects further losses in the next two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the new rent levels will remain unchanged until the next review in 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Walmart is seeking to raise up to US$3.74 billion by selling its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters, as the US retailer focuses on its own operations in China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walmart is offering 144.5 million American depositary shares in the price range of US$24.85 to US$25.85, the term sheet shows, and Morgan Stanley is the broker-dealer of the offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walmart, the largest shareholder in JD.com, said in a statement that it had been a valued partner over the past eight years, and the US retailer was committed to a continued commercial relationship with the Chinese e-commerce giant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This decision allows us to focus on our strong China operations for Walmart China and Sam's Club, and deploy capital towards other priorities," Walmart said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com's Hong Kong-listed shares fell more than 10 percent in early trading on Wednesday. US-listed shares dropped 10 percent in after-market trading on Tuesday to US$25.50 after Bloomberg first reported the share sale plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese e-commerce giant last week reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, though its share price has fallen around 70 percent since its peak in early 2021, and trade is little changed from 2016 levels, when Walmart became its major shareholder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail market has been hit by a persistent downturn in consumer confidence, sparked by a property market slowdown and concerns about employment and incomes. Major e-commerce firms, including JD.com and rivals Alibaba and PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo have engaged in a price war in order to entice consumers to buy, pressuring revenue growth and margins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Walmart said the reduction was to focus on the Chinese market, especially Sam's Club," Liu Xingliang, an internet industry analyst at Beijing-based DCCI Data Center said of the share sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This means that Walmart is optimising its global business layout, rather than lacking confidence in JD.com's development prospects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walmart reported a 17.7 percent year-on-year rise in revenue from its China business to US$4.6 billion in the second quarter on the back of strong growth in its Sam's Club warehouse chain and its digital offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US retailer owns a 5.19 percent stake in JD.com, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The partnership between the companies began in 2016 when Walmart sold its Chinese online grocery store, Yihaodian in return for a 5 percent stake in JD.com. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who got to meet Hong Kong's Olympians in person on Wednesday said they learnt a valuable lesson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sharing session, which followed an open-top bus parade by the athletes, took place behind closed doors inside government headquarters in Tamar and lasted about half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlie, who trains in track and field, said she found out what it takes to become an elite athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a great opportunity for us student athletes to have a better understanding of how high, elite-level athletes, how they compete, what they prepare mentally, physically and also maybe psychologically on such a big stage, the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it's a great experience for us to know more about the profession, and also it allows us to be more motivated for our own respective sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the session, the athletes headed outdoors to meet fans who had been waiting at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey drew cheers everywhere she went, and she stopped to sign autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians then gathered on the lawn for a photo with some primary school pupils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes' packed schedule was set to continue in the afternoon with a lunch hosted by Chief Executive John Lee, followed by a joint reception by the SAR government and the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.

 The Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics on Wednesday received a hero's welcome around town, with excited fans braving the rain to applaud the athletes on board two open-top buses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 90-minute parade featured members of the team such as Paris gold medallist and fencing queen Vivian Kong and swimming star Siobhan Haughey, who took home two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's only two-time Olympic champion, fencer Edgar Cheung, did not attend the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two buses carrying the star-studded delegation set off from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin and passed by Tai Wai MTR station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier, considered the best viewing locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shirley, one of hundreds of onlookers, voiced her support for the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All athletes are worthy of our attention, because everyone has to put in time and effort. Not just the champions and runners-up, but all Hong Kong athletes. They all deserve our applause," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Su was part of the enthusiastic crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so excited. It was amazing. I yelled the loudest at the scene. I cheered for Vivian Kong, Siobhan Haughey, and Hong Kong. I told Vivian Kong not to cry, and to give us smiles," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dan, who's from California, said: "I think it's great. Hong Kong needs to support its athletes and its sports people more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a good way to meet the people of Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes received roaring applause as they arrived at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alice, 11, said she got an autograph from Haughey towards the end of the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that she is very perseverant. When she sets a goal, she won't give up. I also swim, so we are kind of the same person," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The athletes] did a great job and I want them to keep going and never give up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR team bagged two gold and two bronze medals at the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City forward Phil Foden won the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foden played a key role in City winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old scored 19 times and delivered eight assists for Pep Guardiola's team as they pipped Arsenal to the title on the last day of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win this award is something very special and it is one that I am very proud of and grateful for. To be recognised this way by your fellow professionals means everything and I would like to thank everyone who voted for me," Foden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also want to pay special thanks to Pep, the City coaches and all my teammates as they help me to try and get better every single day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden has already set his sights on a fifth successive Premier League crown after City started their title defence with a 2-0 win at Chelsea on Sunday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Women's T20 World Cup scheduled for October has been moved out of Bangladesh and will instead take place in the United Arab Emirates, the International Cricket Council announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the venue comes after unrest that led to the overthrow of prime minister Sheikh Hasina after 15 years of iron-fisted rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 450 people were killed in the weeks of protests leading up to her August 5 ouster, most by police fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank the team at the BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) for exploring all avenues to try and enable the event to be hosted in Bangladesh," ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But travel advisories from the governments of a number of the participating teams meant that wasn't feasible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "However, they will retain hosting rights. We look forward to taking an ICC global event to Bangladesh in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tournament will be staged October 3-20 across two venues in the UAE – Dubai and Sharjah. (AFP)

    Blinken says 'time is of the essence' for Gaza truce

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken said in Qatar on Tuesday there was no time to waste in securing a Gaza ceasefire deal, as he wrapped up a Middle East tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Time is of the essence" for a truce deal between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, Blinken told reporters at Doha airport as he prepared to fly back to Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This needs to get done, and it needs to get done in the days ahead, and we will do everything possible to get it across the finish line," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said on Monday in Tel Aviv that Israel has accepted a proposal by the United States to bridge the gaps between the two sides and urged Hamas to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports however quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying his government would insist on keeping control of the Philadelphi corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken, asked about Netanyahu's remarks, said that since the start of the conflict it was made "very clear that the United States does not accept any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And recent talks have been "very clear on the schedule and location of IDF (army) withdrawals from Gaza, and Israel has agreed to that," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He declined explicitly to reject Netanyahu's reported remarks, although another US official earlier said the stance was "not constructive" to closing the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and withdrew troops and settlers in 2005, although it has since maintained a crippling blockade on the Palestinian territory and imposed a siege during the current war. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday after an earlier rally supported by strong retail sales figures and a cooler inflation report – as investors look towards a speech from the Federal Reserve chief later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.2 percent to 40,834, while the S&P 500 Index retreated by the same amount to 5,597.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.3 percent to 17,816.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a volatile couple of weeks, and we had a big, big rally from the lows," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, after that kind of a move – and it's been eight or nine days now of the S&P 500 being up – it's pretty typical to have a quiet day of consolidation like we're seeing today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stock markets climbed after the consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, logged its smallest 12-month increase since 2021 – boosting the prospect of a September interest rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But now, investors are looking ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the annual gathering of central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is widely anticipated to keep alive the prospect of a September start to rate cuts – and could give clues on the path of further reductions ahead.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scotland recorded an increase in drug deaths last year, official figures showed on Tuesday, as the country continues to have one of the highest rates of such deaths in Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deaths by drug misuse have blighted some of Scotland's poorest communities for decades and are often branded its "national shame."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Records of Scotland (NRS) said drugs claimed the lives of 1,172 Scots in 2023 – up 121, or 12 percent, from 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland had recorded its lowest drug death figures in five years in 2022, sparking hopes that the country had turned a corner in its fight against drug misuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 279 fewer people died from drug misuse that year compared to 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer-term trend shows that drug misuse deaths are still much more common than they were over two decades ago," said Phillipa Haxton of the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opioid drugs – such as heroin and methadone – were implicated in 80 percent of all drug deaths last year, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures also highlighted a growing threat from super-strong synthetic opioids such as nitazenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They showed that the number of men who died from drug misuse rose by 113 in 2022 to 805 last year, with men twice as likely to die as women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cities of Glasgow and Dundee had the highest rates of death, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People in the most deprived areas of Scotland are more than 15 times as likely to die from drug misuse compared to people in the least deprived areas," said the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland regularly appears at the top of studies measuring drug deaths per million people in European countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the UK, the drug misuse mortality rate was 2.7 times higher in Scotland than in England and Northern Ireland using data from 2022. (AFP)

    US official says Netanyahu remarks 'not constructive'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US official on Tuesday criticised "maximalist" remarks attributed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on maintaining control of the Gaza-Egypt border, saying it was not helpful to reaching a ceasefire with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Maximalist statements like this are not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line," said the senior official travelling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the Middle East, requesting anonymity to talk about sensitive discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such remarks "certainly risk the ability of implementing-level, working-level and technical talks to be able to move forward (once) both parties agree to a bridging proposal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that Blinken stood by his public statement in Tel Aviv on Monday that Netanyahu had agreed to a US proposal to bridge the gaps on a ceasefire laid out on May 31 by President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, in reported remarks to families of victims of attacks, said that Israel would insist on maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor between Gaza and Egypt which Israeli forces seized from Hamas in the more than 10-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We saw the prime minister's comments, especially on some of these items. We're not going to negotiate in public," the US official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that such "technical" issues would need to be ironed out in further discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing Secretary Blinken and the United States are convinced of is the need for getting the ceasefire deal across the finish line," the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be additional conversations on technical specifics, many of which of course are being discussed in the press, which is certainly not helpful to the process," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States expects diplomacy to move forward this week between Israel and Hamas on reaching a ceasefire, despite uncertainties in particular on Hamas's response, the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We fully expect this process to continue into this week," the official said, without confirming any formal meeting this week involving Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House last week, when presenting the bridging proposal in Doha, said that it expected new talks on finalising the deal to take place later this week in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived in Doha late Tuesday for talks with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, after meeting the leaders of Egypt and Israel. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Vladimir Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766960_1_20240821011916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday likened Ukraine's incursion into Russia to the 2004 Beslan school massacre, in which some 330 people died in a hostage siege.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin visited the school for the first time in almost 20 years, paying tribute to the victims at memorials, including a cemetery and the site of the destroyed school, where Chechen militants took more than 1,000 people hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meeting mothers who lost children in the siege, Putin said that Russia's enemies are again trying to destabilise the country, referring to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just as we fought the terrorists, today we have to fight those who are carrying out crimes in the Kursk region," Putin said, referring to Ukraine's cross-border offensive that began two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But just as we achieved our goals in the fight with terrorism, we will achieve these goals also in this direction in the fight with neo-Nazis," Putin added, sitting opposite three women from the Mothers of Beslan group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And we will undoubtedly punish the criminals, there can be no doubt of that," Putin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mothers of Beslan group has long called for an objective probe into the attack and the Russian authorities' response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The September 2004 siege lasted some 50 hours, ending in a gunfight when Russian special forces stormed the building following explosions in the school gym, where the hostages were being held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege in the Caucasus region of North Ossetia came amid a guerilla insurgency by Islamist Chechen separatists, branded "terrorists" by Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin launched a major Russian offensive to quash Chechnya's armed bid for independence in late 1999, weeks before becoming president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war against the Chechen insurgency helped fuel Putin's initial popularity, but at the end of 2019 he described the Beslan siege as a "personal pain" that would remain with him for life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin and the Kremlin were criticised for their handling of the attack at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the meeting with Putin, the Mothers of Beslan complained that Russia's investigation into the school siege has never been completed, the group's co-chairwoman Aneta Gadiyeva told the Agentstvo news outlet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This part of the meeting, unlike Putin's remarks about Ukraine, was not televised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gadiyeva said Putin told the women that he had not known this and would ask the head of the Investigative Committee to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that Russia's handling of the siege had "serious failings" in terms of preventing the attack and its use of excessive lethal force and called on Moscow to take measures to establish the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came two years after Chechen fighters took hundreds hostage in a Moscow theatre, a stand-off which saw more than 130 killed – most by sleeping gas pumped into the theatre by Russian special forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack," the Kremlin press service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also laid red roses at a monument to members of Russia's special forces who died during the storming of School Number One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An "international cultural and patriotic centre for the prevention of terrorism" has been set up at the site of the former school, the Kremlin's press service said on Telegram. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World men's number one Jannik Sinner has been cleared of fault or negligence after failing two drug tests in March, the International Tennis Integrity Authority (ITIA) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An independent tribunal accepted Sinner's explanation that the contamination of banned substance clostebol happened when a member of his support team applied an over-the-counter spray on to treat a small wound of their own earlier this year, the ITIA said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That support team member applied the spray between 5 and 13 March, during which time they also provided daily massages and sports therapy to Sinner, resulting in unknowing transdermal contamination," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ruling is subject to appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the ITIA added. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday said it opposes a report by Bloomberg which quoted US firms as saying they were concerned about the city’s proposed new legislation to enhance cybersecurity of critical infrastructures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bloomberg said in its report earlier that some US tech firms had warned that the proposed cyber regulations could grant the SAR government “unusual access” to their computer systems; and giving authorities “overly broad powers” could threaten the integrity of service providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article also said the American Chamber of Commerce and Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce have also submitted letters during the public consultation period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR administration called Bloomberg’s report biased, saying it had taken the views of the submissions out of context.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the one-month consultation of the legislative framework ended on August 1, the HKSAR Government received 53 submissions, in which 52 submissions supported the legislation and made constructive suggestions, including those from the Asia Internet Coalition, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,” a government statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The proposed legislative framework only concerns protecting the Critical Computer Systems (CCSs) of the Critical Infrastructure Operators (CIOs), which in no way involves the personal data and business information.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out that similar legislation already exists in other jurisdictions, such as the mainland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the European Union and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “CIOs have the responsibility of properly responding to cyberattacks. Only when a CIO is unwilling or unable to respond to an incident on its own would the Commissioner's Office consider applying to a Magistrate for a warrant to connect to the CCSs or install programmes in the CCSs in view of necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and public interest,” the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the administration will continue to engage industry stakeholders in formulating the legislative regime and the related Codes of Practice.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Democratic Republic of Congo Health minister Samuel-Roger Kamba announces a dramatic rise in cases in his country. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766951_1_20240820224627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mpox outbreak is not another Covid-19, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday, because much is already known about the virus and the means to control it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While more research is needed on the Clade 1b strain which triggered the UN agency into declaring an international health emergency, the spread of mpox can be reined in, the WHO's European director Hans Kluge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mpox is not the new Covid," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know how to control mpox. And, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether," he told a media briefing in Geneva, via video-link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July 2022, the WHO declared an emergency over the international outbreak of the less severe Clade 2b strain of mpox, which mostly affected men who have sex with men. The alarm was lifted in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We controlled mpox in Europe thanks to the direct engagement with the most affected communities," said Kluge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robust surveillance, investigating case contacts, behaviour changes in the affected communities and vaccination all contributed to controlling the outbreak, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said the risk to the general population was low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we going to go in lockdown in the WHO European region, (as if) it's another Covid-19? The answer is clearly: 'no'," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is spreading mainly through sexual transmission among adults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said it was also possible that someone in the acute phase of mpox infection, especially with blisters in the mouth, may transmit the virus to close contacts by droplets, in circumstances such as in the home or in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The modes of transmission are still a bit unclear. More research is required," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency was not recommending the use of masks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not recommending mass vaccination. We are recommending to use vaccines in outbreak settings for the groups who are most at risk," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO declared an international health emergency on August 14, concerned by the rise in cases of Clade 1b in the DR Congo and its spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two subtypes of mpox: the more virulent and deadlier Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is a new offshoot of Clade 1, which is now called Clade 1a.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clade 1b outbreak in northeastern DRC was first detected in September last year and is spreading rapidly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Smallwood, WHO Europe's emergency operations programme area manager, explained that the split of Clade 1 into 1a and 1b reflects "change in the evolution of the virus."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1a traditionally has outbreaks resulting from infections from sick animals, with some limited follow-on transmission between humans at the household level, or within communities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with Clade 1B, "we have not isolated or detected zoonotic transmission of Clade 1b," said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it seems to be a strain of the virus that's circulating exclusively within the human population."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts are trying to work out if there is a difference in disease severity between Clades 1a and 1b.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The available vaccines were originally developed for smallpox, and are effective against other viruses in the wider orthopoxvirus family, such as mpox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two mpox vaccines have been used in recent years – MVA-BN, produced by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, and Japan's LC16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also ACAM2000, a second-generation smallpox jab approved in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether a person vaccinated post-exposure to mpox goes on to develop the disease depends on the early administration of the vaccine, said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vaccines can also be used preventatively in people likely to be exposed to the virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jasarevic said results from effectiveness studies indicated that a good level of protection was provided against mpox following vaccination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty secondary students who recently returned from a young astronaut training camp have described their experience as rewarding and inspirational, saying they hope to follow in the footsteps of China's astronauts and make history one day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The teenagers were selected from a pool of around 200 applicants and went through a rigorous screening process, with three rounds of interviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over nine days from late July, they visited the Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Gansu province and the National Time Service Centre in Xi'an.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They even got a chance to meet Liu Yang, China's first female astronaut who was part of the Shenzhou-9 mission in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 of the students met the press at the Space Museum in Tsim Sha Tsui on Tuesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Alex Ngan, who said he was impressed by the progress achieved by the nation on space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went from a satellite that could only know how to repeat one singular song to a space station - it's simply unthinkable," the year eight student from the Canadian International School of Hong Kong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To see the sites that these historic events unfolded and to actually hear from the professionals that work in this field is an amazing experience and I will remember it forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng Tin-ho, a secondary five student from Tsang Pik Shan Secondary School, was touched by the professionalism of workers at the space centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They work in very remote locations, far away from their families and had to endure extreme temperature changes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But they remain dedicated, devoting their lives to what they are most passionate about. I hope I can do the same in the future and contribute to society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest tour was fully sponsored by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now in its 13th edition, the training camp admits 30 students every year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has approved 11 nuclear reactors across five sites, state media reported, as the country continues its push to combat rising emissions from fossil fuels.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Premier Li Qiang presided over a State Council executive meeting on Monday that gave the green light to the projects, Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China National Nuclear Power received approval for three reactors, the company said in a statement on WeChat, while State Power Investment Corp said it had received approval for two units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CGN Power Co, the listed unit of China General Nuclear Power Corp, said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing that it received approvals for six reactors in three sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China currently has 56 operating reactors, accounting for around 5 percent of its total electricity generation, according to the World Nuclear Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new reactors will be spread across Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, China Energy News reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Business news outlet Jiemian reported the total investment for all 11 reactors was expected to exceed 220 billion yuan, with construction taking around five years. (AFP)

    'One Country, Two Systems key to reunification'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the United Front Work Department has stressed that the continuous development of the One Country, Two Systems principle in Hong Kong is playing an important role in China's reunification.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a speech at a conference held in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Shi Taifeng said the SAR is key to the country's reunification efforts, adding that compatriots in the city have all along loved the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continuous development of the implementation of One Country, Two Systems in Hong Kong will provide important reference and play an important role realising the complete reunification of the motherland," Shi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are more confident and capable than ever before to realise the nation's reunification."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Politburo member said that "Taiwan independence" is a dead-end and the initiative to resolve the Taiwan issue has always been on the side of the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current situation across the Taiwan Strait is complex," Shi said in the speech at the Overseas Chinese World Conference for Promoting Peaceful Reunification of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anti-China forces in the West have resorted to any means to inhibit China's development and intensified their efforts to use Taiwan to contain China. The Democratic Progressive Party has been stubbornly insisting on 'Taiwan independence' and inciting cross-strait confrontation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of Beijing's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said seeking reunification is an aspiration of the Chinese people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History has shown that all attempts to oppose China and seek independence would not succeed. When it comes to safeguarding national unity, no one should misjudge the country's firm determination and strong capabilities," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, called on people to "tell the good story of China's reunification".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's success since its return to the motherland has fully demonstrated that One Country, Two Systems is a good system for solving problems left over by history, and for promoting world peace and development," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1,200 people attended the conference in Hong Kong, the second time the SAR has held the event.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766913_1_20240820173123.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures released on Tuesday showed that overall consumer prices in Hong Kong rose by 2.5 percent last month compared with the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That inflation figure was larger than the corresponding increase of 1.5 percent in June and was the highest since November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed higher inflation data to the end of concessionary measures for ratepayers in June, and a rise in transport costs to and from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term. Domestic costs may face some moderate upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties," a government spokesman added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers are being urged to be more supportive of gamers, after a teenager from the SAR was crowned the world’s best Pokémon trainer this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng Yip-kai, who played under the username of “yekai0904”, took home Hong Kong's first Pokémon GO World Championship title and a US$20,000 prize after pulling off a 3-1 win against a Dutch opponent in the grand final in Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, 16, who bowed out early in last year’s competition in Japan, said in a post-match interview that his victory was proof of his dedication to the game and had been a chance to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former Hong Kong Pokémon Go team leader, Sam Cheung, told RTHK that there are currently about 50 active competitive players of the mobile game in the city and Cheng was the SAR’s sole representative this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Cheng had received criticism and insults following his early elimination last year, but showed his resilience with a victorious comeback this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he hoped Cheng’s success will change what people think of gamers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If you watch any live streaming of the Pokémon GO World Championship, you could see on many occasions Cheng used fluent Mandarin and English to do interviews. This shows that he could sharpen his language skills while playing video games. I believe if parents read Cheng’s story they will change how they view gamers,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lai Ching-lung from the University of Hong Kong sponsored Cheng's trip to Japan last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was happy to learn about the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai added that he hopes more people will participate in Pokémon GO and help pay for young gamers to compete overseas.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives from Israel at El-Alamein in Egypt on the next leg of his Mideast trip to secure a truce in Gaza. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766883_2_20240820165113.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Egypt on Tuesday for talks on a Gaza ceasefire as he pushes Hamas to accept a deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday, will afterwards head to Qatar, which along with Egypt is brokering negotiations for a truce in the 10-month Gaza conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His departure from Tel Aviv came as an Israeli kibbutz community announced the death in captivity in Gaza of 79-year-old hostage Avraham Munder, underlining the urgency of a truce and hostage release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kibbutz Nir Oz said Munder had endured "physical and mental torture for months" and called his death "murder". There was no immediate comment from his captors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat flew to El Alamein, the Mediterranean city famous for a World War II battle in 1942, to speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at his summer palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will then head to meet Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha, the scene of ceasefire talks last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Doha negotiations, the United States presented proposals to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas and seal the May 31 ceasefire blueprint laid out by US President Joe Biden, who has faced growing domestic criticism over the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said on Monday that Israel had accepted the US proposal and that he would speak to Egypt and Qatar to gauge the reaction of Hamas, which has no direct relationship with the United States as it considers the militants a terrorist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is, I think, a real sense of urgency here, across the region, on the need to get this over the finish line and to do it as soon as possible," Blinken said on Monday in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States is deeply committed to getting this job done, to getting it done now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also said the ceasefire proposal could be the "last chance" for a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He played down a public rejection by Hamas of the modifications in the latest proposal and said Israel was ready to send a delegation to new talks later this week, which the United States previously said would take place in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A series of reports suggested that Israel has raised new conditions in recent talks, including insisting on control of the Gaza border with Egypt that Israel seized from Hamas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property company Kaisa Group on Tuesday announced an offshore debt restructuring agreement with a key group of bondholders, swapping existing debt into new notes and shares in the company.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-based developer has been working to restructure its offshore debt since defaulting on US$12 billion in offshore bonds in late 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The restructuring plan also covers other debts, including loans and yuan-denominated asset-backed securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa is the second-largest offshore debt issuer among Chinese developers after China Evergrande Group and in 2015 became the first among its peers to default on dollar bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa said in a filing it will issue six tranches of senior notes maturing from 2027 to 2032 with 5 percent-6.25 percent cash interest and eight tranches of mandatory convertible bonds maturing from 2025 to 2032, which will be converted into shares in the company based on an allocation ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To facilitate deleveraging and enhance liquidity, the company added sponsors including chairman Kwok Ying-shing may contribute 115 million yuan of shareholder loan via one or more rights issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa may also elect to propose a management incentive plan to issue up to 3.33 percent ordinary shares of Kaisa and distributed to its personnel after a tranche of the new notes has been fully redeemed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa is due to face a winding-up petition hearing in Hong Kong on September 9, and a debt restructuring agreement will help to push back against the petition. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An emotional Joe Biden won a huge ovation as he gave a farewell speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, after Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance to thank him for being an "incredible" US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I love you," the tearful 81-year-old told the crowd to deafening cheers, less than a month after dropping out of the White House race against Donald Trump and passing the torch to his vice president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden took to the stage to chants of "We love you Joe" from the same party which had pushed him out over concerns about his age, in one of the biggest political shocks in US political history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We both know we have more to do, but we're moving in the right direction," he said, referring to himself and the 59-year-old Harris, who, in the space of a few breathtaking weeks, has turned the presidential race upside down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president has injected new life into the Democratic Party and wiped out Republican rival Donald Trump's lead in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She heaped lavish tribute on Biden, even breaking with tradition to speak on the first night of the convention in praise of her boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president Joe Biden," said Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are forever grateful to you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he has been so often in his five-decade-long political journey, Biden was surrounded by family, with wife Jill Biden and their daughter Ashley introducing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Joe and I have been together for almost 50 years. And still, there are moments when I fall in love with him all over again," the first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats are in an exuberant mood in Chicago, daring to hope for victory in November that seemed inconceivable just weeks ago after Biden's disastrous debate against Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Monday's first night of the convention was an emotional one on many levels, and for many of the key players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hillary Clinton, who lost against Trump in 2016 in her own bid to become America's first woman president, backed Harris to finally break the glass ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Something is happening in America, you can feel it -- something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time," the former secretary of state and first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris will formally accept the party's nomination on the final day Thursday, in her biggest chance yet to define her candidacy in front of a huge audience of tens of millions of American voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her star turn will cap a week where the biggest names from the party's past will endorse her as its future, with former president Barack Obama speaking on Tuesday, and ex-president Bill Clinton introducing Harris's running mate Tim Walz on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    US blames Iran for Trump campaign hack

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US security agencies on Monday said Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier in August that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns," the security agencies said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former president Trump's campaign, which the [intelligence community] attributes to Iran," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations denied the country's role in the hack and challenged Washington to release evidence for the claim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such allegations are unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing," the mission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbours neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the US presidential election. Should the US government genuinely believe in the validity of its claims, it should furnish us with the pertinent evidence -- if any -- to which we will respond accordingly," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States goes to the polls on November 5, with both Trump's and Democratic rival Kamala Harris's campaigns saying they had been targeted by cyber attacks in recent weeks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials say safety inspections have been ordered at Eastern Hospital after two pieces of concrete and part of a false ceiling came down in one of its wards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nobody was injured in the incident in the integrated medical and geriatric male ward at around 8.15pm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the pieces of concrete were 20 centimetres long, 30 centimetres wide and three centimetres thick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceiling was repaired and the ward is operating as usual, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital is very concerned about the incident and has arranged safety inspections to the facilities in the ward again immediately. The hospital is investigating the cause of concrete spalling," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital has regular inspection of hospital facilities and the last inspection at this area was in April last year."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, on Tuesday recorded the first senior Grand Slam victory of his career, after beating Chile's Cristian Garin in the first qualifying round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong went a set down, 4-6, before fighting back 7-6, 6-3 for the victory against Garin, who's now ranked 116th in the world but was once as high as 17th in 2021 and made it the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China player is currently ranked 38 spots lower than the Chilean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong will next play Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yu-hsiou in the second round of qualifiers. Hsu is ranked 185th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are three rounds of qualifiers in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draw for the main round of the men's singles will be made at Friday midnight, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Wong won the Australian Open junior doubles title two years ago.

    Sabalenka, Sinner victorious at Cincinnati Open final

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766839_1_20240820083919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka thrust herself into US Open title contention on Monday with a 6-3, 7-5 defeat of Jessica Pegula to win the 15th title of her career at the Cincinnati Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The third seed – who missed Wimbledon with a shoulder injury – won a trophy for the first time since collecting her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played in the final and that I was able to get this title. It's really important going into the US Open," Sabalenka said. "I'm sure Jess and I will have more battles in the future – let's keep it up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the men's draw, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe in straight sets to secure his maiden Cincinnati Open championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner claimed his fifth victory of the season in emphatic style, swatting aside Tiafoe 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in 1hr 36min to underscore his credentials for next Monday's US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian top seed bided his time in the first set before breaking the match open in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiafoe, whose game faded after losing the first-set tiebreaker, still made an impression. The American, who moves into the ranking top-20, saved three match points before Sinner claimed his 15th career title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cincinnati is the fifth trophy of 2024 for the 23-year-old Italian, who began the season with an Australian Open title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy, this was a very difficult week," Sinner said. "It was tough mentally but I tried to do my best. I'm just glad I kept my level in the important moments. I handled the situations on court well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Sinner's third in an ATP Masters event after previous victories in Toronto and Miami. (AFP)

 Dan Lawrence will open the batting for England in the first Test of a three-match series against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, while Matthew Potts has been drafted in to compensate for the loss of captain Ben Stokes to injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawrence has only operated as an opener a handful of times in his first-class career but returns to the England side for the first time in two-and-a-half years after Zak Crawley's fractured finger opened up a vacancy at the top of the order.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thierry Henry has decided to step down from his role as coach of the France under-21 football team, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former France international Henry made the decision after guiding the under-23 side to a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The all-time leading goalscorer for Premier League giants Arsenal took over as coach of the French youth side last summer and was under contract until June 2025 but decided to step away for "personal reasons", according to the FFF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry oversaw Les Bleuets' first run to the final of an Olympics men's tournament since winning gold in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His young side eventually went down 5-3 after extra time against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss ended a promising run that had started inauspiciously after Henry was obliged to make several changes to his squad pre-tournament, due to the refusal of certain clubs to release their players for the Games. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Monday, extending last week's positive trend as markets await earnings from US retailers and central bank commentary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's results from big-box chains Target, Lowe's and TJX will offer additional clues about the state of the US economy following reassuring retail sales data last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today seems to be an extension of the positive trend" from last week, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, who noted a chance that low trading volumes amid the "dog days" of summer holidays could lead to outsized market moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,896.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,608, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 17,876.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks rallied last week following encouraging US economic data that offered reassurances after recession fears buffeted markets earlier in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, chip company AMD piled on 4.5 percent after announcing a US$4.9 billion deal to acquire ZT Systems, which provides server solutions for cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  General Motors gained 1.0 percent after confirming plans to trim its software and services workforce. The auto giant will cut more than 1,000 jobs, according to US media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's calendar includes the Democratic Party's convention in Chicago, with Vice President Kamala Harris slated to deliver a headline speech on Thursday.

 Former US Representative George Santos pleaded guilty on Monday to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the federal fraud case that led to his expulsion from Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New York Republican entered the plea in a courtroom in Long Island just weeks before his trial was set to begin in early September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was indicted on felony charges that he stole from political donors, used campaign contributions to pay for personal expenses, lied to Congress about his wealth and collected unemployment benefits while actually working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was expelled from the US House after an ethics investigation found “overwhelming evidence” that he had broken the law and exploited his public position for his own profit. (AP)

    Trump posts images implying Taylor Swift supports him

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's Truth Social platform shared AI-generated images appearing to show he has Taylor Swift's support. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766817_1_20240820024552.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has shared doctored images on social media showing Taylor Swift and her fans support his presidential campaign, in an apparent effort to tap into the pop singer's mega star power in the US election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swift has not yet publicly thrown her weight behind any presidential candidate in the November 5 election, but she backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and has previously been critical of Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Trump shared screenshots of posts with manipulated images – including some that an expert said appeared to be AI-generated – suggesting that the pop star and her fans, popularly known as Swifties, support his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Truth Social post, which includes a poster of Swift clad in an Uncle Sam outfit and instructing her fans to vote for Trump, the former president wrote: "I accept!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That poster is either "AI generated or just classically manipulated," said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The post also includes photos of women wearing shirts with the slogan "Swifties for Trump," some of which Farid said had the "tell-tale signs of being AI generated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What makes the mash-up "particularly devious" is that is a combination of real and fake imagery, with at least one photo of a woman wearing such a shirt looking legitimate, Farid said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Swift about the post by Trump, who separately shared on Truth Social a video of a supporter voicing the dubious claim that "Swifties were rallying for Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's soaring popularity and sway over her fans could make her support valuable in the upcoming presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats have long wanted to count on her support, but the megastar has been largely reticent about her political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration of her star power, when Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote last fall, directing them to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, her plea had an immediate impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following her message, the institution said it recorded more than 35,000 new registrations, 23 percent more than last year and the most since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's feelers into politics have been heavily scrutinised, making her a ripe target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her reserve led many critics to speculate Swift was a closet Republican, until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right US Senator Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since spoken out in particular for the legal right to an abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, intense speculation has swirled on social media that Swift will endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The megastar has not commented publicly, but that has not stopped legions of fans to form a group called "Swifties for Kamala," attracting tens of thousands of followers on platforms such as Instagram and X, formerly Twitter. (AFP)

    City of Pokrovsk evacuated as Kremlin rules out talks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday ruled out entering peace talks with Ukraine over Kyiv's surprise offensive into Russian territory, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said was meeting its goals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine sent troops over the border on August 6 and has since held onto a part of the western Kursk region, in the biggest attack on Russian soil since Moscow attacked in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move has rattled Moscow and taken Ukraine's Western allies by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has said the offensive is aimed at stretching Russian forces, creating a "buffer zone" and bringing the conflict "closer" to an end on "fair" terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said on Monday that it had pushed the prospect of peace talks further away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the current stage, given this escapade, we will not talk."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called entering a negotiating process "completely inappropriate" and said future talks "depend on the situation on the battlefield, including in the Kursk region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow, intent on not letting the offensive affect its own advance in eastern Ukraine, claimed another village in the war-battered Donetsk region on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bracing for a further assault, Ukraine ordered the evacuation of families from the key city of Pokrovsk as Moscow's forces inched closer to the logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, meanwhile, said his troops in Kursk – who have set up administrative offices and published previously unthinkable footage of Ukrainian soldiers patrolling Russian streets – are meeting their targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are achieving our goals. This morning we have another replenishment of the (prisoner of war) exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to more Russian troops being taken prisoner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Zelensky said the push into Russian territory was designed to create a "buffer zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prospect of peace talks appeared distant even before Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin had demanded Ukraine cede swathes of territory if it wanted a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, who has ruled out direct talks with the Kremlin, demands Russia's full withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and reparations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, Ukraine has destroyed two key bridges over the Seym river inside Russia, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes to the combat zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bridge over the river was hit over the weekend, a Russian military investigator said in a video published by high-profile pro-Kremlin TV commentator Vladimir Solovyev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on the bridges have left Russia with limited options, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's defence ministry said on Monday Russia had thwarted Ukrainian attacks on three more villages in the Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has also been accused of sending inexperienced conscripts to protect the Kursk region, unwilling to redeploy experienced fighters from the frontlines in eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incursion has visibly worried Russians, prompting some in Kyiv to hope that sentiment could turn the country against the Kremlin's more than two-year war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accustomed to seeing the war as a television show, Russians are now seeing it up close and personal," Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you don't want to see the war, you have to end the war by forcing your 'leadership' to make peace on fair terms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, Moscow said it captured the town of Artemovo, which is called Zalizne in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zalizne had a population of around 5,000 at the start of 2022 – making it one of the largest places captured by Russian troops in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine also said Russian attacks killed four people in frontline towns on Monday, with a 71-year-old woman killed in her garden in Toretsk and three civilians in their 60s and 70s killed in the village of Zarichne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the front moved further west towards the city of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian officials announced the compulsory evacuation of families with children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are starting the forced evacuation of families with children from the Pokrovsk community," Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said, ordering the "compulsory" evacuation of children and their parents from Pokrovsk and about a dozen surrounding villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said more than 53,000 people live in the area, including almost 4,000 children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Filashkin called the decision to evacuate "necessary and inevitable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has long tried to capture Pokrovsk, which lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops. (AFP)

 Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan announced his retirement from international football on Monday after leading his country at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "After a few weeks of reflection, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to end my national team career," Gundogan said in a German FA statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look back with great pride on 82 international matches for my home country – a number that I could never have dreamed of when I made my debut for the senior national team in 2011."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan, who turns 34 in October, was in the Germany team that reached the Euro 2024 quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My highlight was clearly the huge honour of being able to lead the team as captain at our home European Championship last summer," said the Barcelona midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan made his debut for Germany against Belgium in October 2011 but missed their 2014 World Cup triumph with a back injury. He was also ruled out of Euro 2016 due to a dislocated kneecap. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Donahue, a pioneering US talk show host, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Donahue's death in Manhattan on Sunday following a long illness was announced on NBC's Today Show, where he made frequent appearances from 1979 to 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Phil Donahue Show," launched in 1967, was the first on daytime US television to feature audience participation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It remained popular through the 1970s and into the 1980s, earning Donahue numerous Emmy Awards, and the format was adopted by future talk show hosts such as Oprah Winfrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Donahue show was also notable for bringing conversations about controversial issues such as abortion, religion and sex to daytime television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Joe Biden in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He pioneered the live daytime talk show, holding a mirror up to America," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He interviewed everyone from our greatest stars to our forgotten neighbours, uniting us around the toughest issues of our time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue was married for 44 years to actress Marlo Thomas, the star of the 1960s sitcom "That Girl." (AFP)

    Blinken meets Israeli leaders at 'decisive moment'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken on Monday urged Israel and Hamas not to derail negotiations that he said may be a "last opportunity" to secure a Gaza truce and hostage release deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since Hamas's October 7 attack triggered the war, said he was back in Israel "to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a decisive moment – probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US secretary of state later met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and is due to travel on Tuesday to Egypt where ceasefire talks are expected to resume this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for delays in reaching a truce accord that diplomats say could help avert a wider conflagration in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places, and to greater intensity," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Months of on-off negotiations with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have failed to produce an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of talks in Qatar last week, Hamas called on mediators to implement a framework outlined in late May by US President Joe Biden, rather than hold more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire was "still possible" and that the United States was "not giving up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday, hours after Blinken had landed in the city, there was a bombing in Tel Aviv that was later claimed by the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One person – the bomber according to Israeli media – was killed and another wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The groups threatened to carry out more such attacks in Israel "as long as the occupation's massacres, the displacement of civilians and the policy of assassinations continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the bombing could have been more serious but the assailant detonated the explosives before managing to reach a more heavily populated area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as Israel and Hamas traded blame for delays in reaching a truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Qatar meeting last week, the United States submitted what mediators called a "bridging proposal," which Hamas on Sunday said "responds to Netanyahu's conditions" and includes terms that the Palestinian group would not accept.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas insisted on "a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip," saying Netanyahu wanted to keep Israeli forces at several strategic locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators," the Palestinian movement said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order for an agreement to be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Netanyahu said that Hamas "remains obstinate" and must be pressured, a day after his office said Israeli negotiators had expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators also reported progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to the prime minister's governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 40,139 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan announced by Biden at the end of May would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks while Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence raged on in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, an Israeli soldier and two Hezbollah fighters were killed in cross-border clashes, the Israeli military and the Lebanese militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In southern Gaza, a medical source said three people were killed in Abassan village and witnesses reported Israeli air strikes near the Islamic University in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops were operating in southern and central Gaza, and that the air force "struck over 45 terrorist targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It later said that it had "expanded" operations in Khan Younis and the outskirts of Deir el-Balah. A medical source said a baby girl was killed and several women wounded in air strikes west of Khan Younis.
  <br/>

 Four people from Hong Kong have been arrested in Thailand on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thai authorities seized 14kg of heroin and said the suspects tried to send the drugs to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to an inquiry from RTHK, the Immigration Department said it has confirmed the identities of those arrested through the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added that it will follow up on the case.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says companies should prioritise hiring local workers before turning to non-local labour.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Monday reassured local workers that the government would ensure they have priority in employment amid concerns about competition with non-local labour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun's remarks came a day after the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) called for the setting up of a mechanism that would trigger the suspension of labour importation schemes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FTU said local employees are facing challenges in finding jobs in the retail, catering and construction sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three sectors were included in labour importation schemes introduced by the government last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Sun stressed that companies should prioritise hiring local workers before turning to non-local labour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when companies fail to hire a sufficient workforce through local recruitment can they proceed to the next stage – to apply to import labour through industry quotas or general schemes. This demonstrates that the mechanism (of labour importation schemes) itself guarantees priority for local workers in employment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most importantly, if local workers show greater willingness to work, the number of imported labour will subsequently decrease."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The welfare minister also said the government is looking into setting up a database for high-risk caregivers after an elderly woman and her son, who had cared for her, were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the authorities will take privacy concerns into consideration.
