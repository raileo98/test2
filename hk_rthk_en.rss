<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday was formally elected as the leader of the National Democratic Alliance coalition, which won the most number of seats in the country's national election after his political party failed to win a majority on its own.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 73-year-old leader, who will be sworn in as prime minister on Sunday for a rare third term, will now form a coalition government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi’s Hindu nationalist BJP has governed India as part of the NDA coalition over the past decade, but this is the first time under his leadership that the party has needed support from its regional allies to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This alliance of ours reflects India's spirit in its true sense,” Modi said after the BJP and coalition members backed him as their prime ministerial candidate. “We were neither defeated nor are we defeated ... it was an NDA government in the past, still is and will be,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Full results from India’s six week-long election, which began in mid-April, were released on Wednesday. The BJP won 240 seats, well below the 272 mark needed for a majority in a stunning upset. Together, the parties in the NDA coalition bagged 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Modi's political challenger, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, put up a stronger-than-expected fight, defying predictions of decline by doubling its strength from the last election to win a total of 232 seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Modi was formally elected as the NDA leader, local media reported that the two key regional allies which can make or break his coalition government – the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state and Janata Dal (United) in eastern Bihar state – were eyeing posts in important ministries, some of which the BJP have held so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the newly emboldened opposition ramped up pressure on Modi and the BJP. In a press conference, the Congress party's main campaigner Rahul Gandhi demanded a parliamentary investigation into what he called the “biggest stock market scam,” alleging that Modi and other top BJP ministers misled retail investors who ended up losing money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's two main benchmark stock indexes hit new highs on Monday after exit polls predicted a BJP sweep, but dropped sharply on Tuesday to close down more than 5% as early vote figures trickled in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In television interviews last month, Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah said the markets would surge when results were declared on June 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP denied Gandhi's accusations of a ploy between the party and exit pollsters, and accused the Congress leader of trying to discourage investors. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The British PM says that "on reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756562_1_20240607234949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak apologised on Friday for leaving D-Day commemorations in France early to return to the election campaign trail – a decision slammed as disgraceful by his political rivals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunak, who is fighting to keep his job in Britain’s July 4 election , said that, “on reflection” the decision was a mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak was not alongside leaders including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the major memorial event at Omaha Beach in Normandy on Thursday. Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who is now foreign minister, represented the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, the current favourite to win the election, attended and was pictured meeting Zelenskyy and other leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak had earlier attended a ceremony at the British memorial in Normandy alongside King Charles and surviving World War II veterans. He also attended a commemoration in Portsmouth, England, the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion that helped free Europe from the Nazis “should be about those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The last thing I want is for the commemorations to be overshadowed by politics.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: “On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer – and I apologise," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister recorded an interview with broadcaster ITV on Thursday after returning from France, though he said that was not the reason he cut short his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak insisted he “stuck to the itinerary” that had been laid out for him for D-Day weeks before he called the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On reflection it was a mistake not to stay longer and I’ve apologised for that, but I also don’t think it’s right to be political in the midst of D-Day commemorations," he said. "The focus should rightly be on the veterans and their service and sacrifice for our country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A clip released from the interview by ITV showed Sunak denying opposition allegations that he lied by making inaccurate statements about the opposition Labour Party’s tax plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said “Rishi Sunak will have to answer for his choice” to skip the D-Day event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me there was only one choice. ... There was nowhere else I was going to be," Starmer told broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said it was “a total dereliction of duty” for Sunak to skip the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, said “patriotic people who love their country” should not vote for Sunak. Farage is seeking to siphon off Conservative voters with his populist, anti-immigration positions. He is sure to raise the D-Day episode in a seven-party televised debate later on Friday. All the main parties will be represented, though Sunak and Starmer are not due to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Craig Oliver, who was communications director to Cameron’s Conservative government, said “the problem for Rishi Sunak this morning is he’s accused of not getting what it is to be a prime minister and what his duties are as a prime minister.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All 650 seats in the House of Commons are up for grabs on July 4. The leader of the party that can command a majority – either alone or in coalition – will become prime minister. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Christian Zheng Sheng College, a school that helps students quit drugs, announced it's closing down in a month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The college's supervisor, Chui Hong-sheung, said the decision was made on Thursday night during an online board meeting which he didn't take part in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui pointed out that the cash-strapped college currently has around ten students, and he believes the authorities will make arrangements for them to be transferred elsewhere. He added that some teachers have already quit the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there are not many students involved, I think it's highly likely that the authorities can offer them help. But whether or not the students and their parents are willing to be transferred is another matter," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others, including the institution’s head, Alman Chan, were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Christian Zheng Sheng earlier told the press that relevant bank accounts had been frozen by officers as part of the probe, and it was facing dire economic difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government gave the school more than HK$1 million in emergency funding in March, but Chui said the money has since been used up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority said Zheng Sheng College has failed to make MPF contributions for around 20 employees between February and April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it will take follow up action accordingly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Russia next week for a gathering of counterparts from the Brics group of emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang will meet with other foreign ministers for talks "on issues of common concern such as Brics cooperation and current and regional situations", Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mao said that Brics is an important platform for cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries and that members "have always been committed to safeguarding multilateralism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting takes place on Monday and Tuesday in western Russia's Nizhny Novgorod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to work "to consolidate the Brics strategic relations, deepen practical cooperation in various fields, (and) promote shared development and joint self-reliance in the global South", Mao said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bloc, its name derived from the initials of founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced last year a major expansion in membership, described at the time by President Xi Jinping as "historic". (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Rosanna Law said around 88 percent of "rich" public flat tenants have made asset and income declarations. File photo: RTHK' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756516_1_20240607161943.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Housing Rosanna Law said on Friday that most public housing tenants suspected of exceeding income and asset limits have made relevant declarations, and those who haven't done so risk having their homes taken back by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A deadline for some 250,000 so-called "rich tenants" to declare their income and assets passed at the end of last month. People with too much money have to leave their public flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said around 88 percent of tenants have made declarations, and officials will send letters to the rest next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said those who still don't make declarations could see their tenancy terminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will remind you again, that if you wish to continue living in the flat, I will give you a deadline to fill in the declaration form and provide a written reply explaining the late submission," Law said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said those who don't return the form or fail to provide a clear explanation would be considered to have decided not to extend their tenancy, and the flats will be taken back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discretion will be exercised if tenants report family members have been out of Hong Kong or in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the latest round of declarations, officials have taken back more than 1,200 flats, Law said. The units will be reallocated after renovation work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said officials are aware of reports that some public flat tenants have been seen driving luxury cars with cross-boundary licence plates. She said in some cases, investigations will be carried out to see whether there has been any wrongdoing in terms of income and asset checks.

    PolyU device samples soil from far side of moon

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University on Friday said equipment it developed has enabled China’s Chang’e-6 space mission to sample soil from the far side of the moon – the first such feat in history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Yung Kai-leung, director of the university's Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations, said their sampling system, unlike those used by other countries, is fully automated, which means it can prevent contamination and is more efficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The device consists of two shovel and claw-shaped samplers, two monitoring cameras, as well as a packaging system, Yung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automated process involves the cameras selecting an area to sample, before the samplers collect the soil and put it into a container.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The academic said it took his team at the university six years to design and manufacture the sampling system, as it is no easy task operating on the far side of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still experience communication problems. So we had to modify the method of regolith acquisition so that we can speed up the acquisition, sealing and packing. We had to upgrade our design,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung said he believes that more than 1.75 kg of lunar soil was collected during an operation on Monday, and the material will be of scientific significance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The lunar regolith, especially those on the far side, are subject to a rigorous environment of space radiation, meteorites and things like that. So they contain a lot of useful elements that we may not be able to find on Earth.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the samples may also help scientists better understand the formation of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang’e 6-spacecraft is expected to return to Earth on June 25.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The youth sports ground at the Kai Tak Sports Park will be the first public venue to use "lay and pay" technology for the pitch, with officials saying it should provide more stability and flexibility when organising events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The venue will be available for events including football and rugby matches, as well as school sports days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Managers of the sports park say about 650 rolls of turf, each measuring 1.2 metres by 10 metres, were harvested in Zhuhai and transported to Hong Kong for installation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hybrid turf consists of 95 percent natural grass and five percent artificial grass fibres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malcolm Caddies, a general manager at sports venue management company ASM Global, said the turf can minimise the chances of matches being called off due to unstable conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hybrid surface is way more stable, way more secure. You're not going to get soggy fields like you traditionally do in wet conditions, so it will certainly allow for more matches in inclement weather," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caddies added that a rain harvesting system, which can drain about 1,000 millimetres of rain per hour, has been installed underneath the sports ground to deal with extreme weather.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports grew more quickly and for a second month in May, suggesting factory owners are managing to find buyers overseas and providing some relief to the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Friday, beating a forecast 6 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 1.5 percent rise seen in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports increased 1.8 percent in May, slowing from an 8.4 percent jump in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over recent months, a flurry of data has shown different parts of the US$18.6 trillion economy recovering at varying speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While first quarter growth blew past forecasts and strong March export and output data suggested improving global demand might aid officials' efforts to get the economy back on a more even keel, recent indicators have reflected domestic consumption had softened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A protracted property sector crisis remains the biggest drag on China's economy, with low investor and consumer confidence hurting domestic consumption and undermining business activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Friday's trade data should give authorities some breathing space as they continue their efforts to foster a broad-based economic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its China growth forecast for 2024 in line with Beijing's growth target of "around" five percent, but warned of risks to the economy from the property troubles. (Reuters)

    Flavoured cigarette ban will deter visitors: lawmaker

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to ban flavoured cigarettes will deter some tourists and businesspeople from coming to Hong Kong, a lawmaker warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is among 10 new measures aimed at reducing the number of smokers in the city, with others including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up if they're in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu told RTHK he was worried some people would think twice about coming to Hong Kong when they hear about the flavoured cigarette ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Fruit-flavoured cigarettes are sold in all parts of the world. Assuming people are not allowed to purchase these cigarettes, it would mean that their freedom of choice is being restricted,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If some of these people are used to smoking fruit-flavoured cigarettes in their own countries, and they visit Hong Kong where such products are prohibited, they would then think twice before travelling to the SAR for tourism or business.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Henry Tong, who chairs the Council on Smoking and Health, said he was in favour of the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really welcome the government's new measure... banning flavoured tobacco products would make cigarette smoking much less attractive to young people and female smokers," he said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health, Eddie Lee, meanwhile, said the government is adopting a "gradual and systemic" approach to making smoking culturally unacceptable in Hong Kong.

    China women's hockey team hopeful for an Olympic medal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team has set their sights on a podium spot at this year's Olympics, even though they have a tough road ahead to clinch a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations have been underway for the Paris Games, with the team recently spending almost two months in the Australian city of Perth for a training programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhong Jiaqi, who's playing in her second Olympics, said the squad is more prepared this time than during the Tokyo Games in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we are more confident, and the whole team is in a very good condition,” Zhong said. “It could be because our result in the last Olympics was not satisfactory, so we want this year's Games to be good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow teammate and defender Zheng Jiali, who is representing China for the first time at the Olympics, said the team is aiming for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have strengthened techniques and strategies, as well as our fitness. There are overall changes and adjustments,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team achieved its best Olympic result on home soil during the 2008 Beijing Games, where they took silver. One of their coaches, Huang Yongsheng, said the team's success does not stop there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether it's 2008 or after 2008, the goal of the women's hockey team has never changed. We strive to do our best and always work to achieve the best results,” Huang said. “I feel like [the achievement in] 2008 is not our endpoint, it is just a starting point.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two years ago, Australia’s two-time Olympic gold medalist Alyson Annan took charge of the Chinese squad, and coach Huang said it has helped the team grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She brought some pioneering concepts from the West, merging them with what we already had in China, in the hope of better techniques and tactics that fit China more," Huang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team faces an uphill battle in Paris, having been placed in the same group as reigning Olympic champions the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other teams in the same group include Belgium, Germany, Japan and hosts France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team manager Guo Hong said he is certain the team will give their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everyone has an Olympic dream. But I think we should be realistic and do things gradually,” Guo said.

    Porzingis' return fuels Boston Game-1 win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kristaps Porzingis returned from a 10-game absence to record 20 points off the bench and the Boston Celtics snuffed a second-half rally to beat the Dallas Mavericks 107-89 on Thursday night in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Porzingis hadn't played since Game 4 of Boston's first-round series against the Miami Heat due to a right calf strain. He seemed unfazed by the long layoff, though, shooting 8-for-13 from the field while collecting six rebounds and three blocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by as many as 29 late in the first half, Dallas got back into the game thanks to a third-quarter outburst headlined by Luka Doncic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star guard accounted for 10 points during the Mavericks' 22-9 surge to open the frame, with his 3-pointer cutting Dallas' deficit to 72-64 with 4:28 to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics responded emphatically, rattling off the next 14 points to take a 22-point lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Gafford closed the third with a pair of free throws to get Dallas within 20, but the Mavericks trailed by at least 17 for the entirety of the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 2 is set for Sunday in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 22 points and added six boards, three steals and three blocks. Jayson Tatum chipped in 16 points and 11 rebounds, while Derrick White netted 15 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic recorded 30 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which got outshot 47.6 percent to 41.7 percent overall. P.J. Washington went for 14 points, Jaden Hardy scored 13, and Kyrie Irving, showered with boos all night, had 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Porzingis didn't draw the start, he wasted no time setting the tone after checking in with 7:17 left in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big man tortured his former team, scoring 11 points and blocking a pair of shots in the period to lift the Celtics to a 37-20 advantage after 12 minutes of action. No team has ever built a larger lead in the first quarter of Game 1 in Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston kept pouring it on, using a 14-2 run to go up 58-29 with 4:11 remaining in the second quarter. However, Doncic proceeded to erupt for nine points over the final four minutes of the first half, helping the Mavericks pull within 63-42 by the break. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bar Association on Friday expressed regret over the resignations of two top court judges, and said their departure would not affect the court's judicial functions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its remarks came after two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – tendered their resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar respects their personal decision and is also grateful for their contributions to the development of our jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong," the association wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar strongly believes that their resignations will not affect the ability of our apex court in discharging its judicial functions and has every confidence in the independence of our judicial system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Law Society said it is grateful to all current and past non-permanent judges for their "faithful and fearless discharge of their important role in the administration of justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its president Chan Chak-ming said the society supports keeping overseas non-permanent judges in Hong Kong, as stated in the Basic Law.

    Tobacco control experts welcome new anti-smoking moves

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Judith Mackay from Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control also said she had never met a smoker who wanted to keep smoking. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756456_1_20240607092658.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert in tobacco control has hailed the government's latest moves to bring down the smoking rate, but she says that more measures will be needed going forward especially when it comes to stopping young people from smoking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, the director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control, Judith Mackay, said the short-term measures, including banning flavoured cigarettes, were spot on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it is really important that the government has done this," she said. "I mean we still have 600,000 smokers in Hong Kong and we know that 400,000 of them will die from tobacco."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay also said governments needed to think of new ways to tackle smoking going forward and this included banning the sale of cigarettes to people born after a certain date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think you can divide tobacco control into two areas. One is existing measures and extending them," she said. "But then we also have to think of new measures and to try to be innovative, particularly in terms of young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay said the idea of having a smoke-free generation had been considered in New Zealand and the UK but had been stymied by changes in government. She said it didn't surprise her that the SAR government hadn't included a ban on sales of tobacco to people born before a certain date in its latest measures but that it was still on the books.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the government proposed a blanket ban on E-cigarettes, flavoured cigarettes and lighting up while in a queue, as part of moves designed to bring about a "cultural change". Other planned measures include removing branding from cigarette packaging and heightening health warnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay also said she had never met a smoker who wanted to keep smoking. She said parents who smoked also didn't want their children to smoke as it was dangerous and expensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Henry Tong - who chairs the Council on Smoking and Health - said vapes and flavoured cigarettes have been shown to be particularly attractive to young smokers and female smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The survey yesterday that the government released shows that about 70 percent of female smokers and young smokers smoke flavoured tobacco products," he said while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme. "And vapes, e-cigarettes, these are trendy products. They are attractive to young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said banning the possession of e-cigarettes was the second half of the government's action against the product, after it banned their importation, manufacture and sale two years ago. He said he really welcomed the government's measure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Health Secretary, Lo Chung-mau, has said the government plans to reduce the smoking prevalence rate to to 7.8 [ercent next year from the current 9.1 percent.

    Starliner docks at ISS in spite of glitches

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's two-member Starliner crew received a warm welcome aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on Thursday after successfully docking, a key test of the new spacecraft's flight-worthiness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rendezvous was achieved despite an earlier loss of several guidance-control jet thrusters, some of them due to a helium propulsion leak, which Nasa and Boeing said had been partially fixed and should not compromise the mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams aboard, arrived at the orbiting platform after a flight of nearly 27 hours following its launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A live Nasa video feed showed the smiling new arrivals, wearing their blue flight suits, weightlessly floating headfirst through the padded passageway, one after the other, into the station. Williams was first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're just as happy as can be to be up in space," she said during a brief welcoming ceremony a short time later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Starliner autonomously docked with the ISS while both were orbiting some 250 miles over the southern Indian Ocean at 1.34 p.m. EDT, as the two vehicles soared around the globe in tandem at about 17,500 miles per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its US$4.2 billion, fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different US rides to the ISS.

 The United States beat Pakistan in a Super Over in Dallas on Thursday to achieve one of the biggest upsets in Twenty20 World Cup history and secure their second win of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pakistan, the 2009 champions, recovered from a poor start to score 159-7 but the U.S. plundered 14 runs from their final over to finish on 159-3 and send the match to a Super Over.

  The tournament co-hosts made 18-1, helped by two wides from Pakistan, before restricting their opponents to 13-1 to seal a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a big achievement beating Pakistan and playing for the first time," U.S. captain and player of the match Monank Patel said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The way we played today I'm really proud of the boys and it was a complete team effort from ball one to the last ball."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan captain Babar Azam bemoaned his side's batting performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We didn't capitalise with the bat and they took a lot of momentum. We lost back-to-back wickets in the middle overs. As a batting unit you need to step up, you need to create partnerships and we didn't do that," Babar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Credit to USA, they performed so well today. They were better than us in all aspects of the game." (Reuters)

    Italy's Paolini to play Swiatek in French Open final

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jasmine Paolini will play Iga Swiatek in the French Open final after the Italian 12th seed ended the run of 17-year-old Russian sensation Mirra Andreeva in the last four on Thursday, winning 6-3, 6-1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paolini is through to her first Grand Slam final at the age of 28. She had never gone beyond the second round of a major before the start of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 15 had won a total of four matches in 16 Grand Slam appearances before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now she is one win away from an improbable title at Roland Garros as she tries to emulate compatriot Francesca Schiavone, who won the 2010 French Open. Paolini is also guaranteed to break into the top 10 for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I learned I think a little bit later than other players, to dream is the most important thing in sport and in life," said Paolini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy I could dream this moment. I don't know what to say, I'm so emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva had become the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist in 27 years with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her bid to be crowned the youngest major champion since Martina Hingis at the 1997 US Open was cut short as Andreeva was unable to reproduce the level that saw her put out an ailing Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini snatched the only break of a tight opening set in the fourth game, saving five break chances across her next two service games to keep Andreeva at arm's length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The errors continued to pile up for Andreeva and Paolini seized her opportunity once more when it arose at 1-1 in the second set, before breaking for a second time to stride towards the finish line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Andreeva looking increasingly disconsolate and fighting back tears, Paolini applied the coup de grace with one last break to complete a resounding victory. (AFP)

    Cyril Ramaphosa says ANC wants national unity govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday that his African National Congress (ANC) would seek to form a government of national unity with a broad group of opposition parties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of the government of national unity must be, first and foremost, to tackle the pressing issues that South Africans want to be addressed," Ramaphosa said after a marathon ANC meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These issues include job creation and the growth of our economy that will be inclusive, the high cost of living, service delivery, crime and corruption," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In last week's general election, the ANC won just over 40 percent of the vote and 158 seats in South Africa's National Assembly, falling short of an outright majority for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Ramaphosa acknowledged after ten hours of intense talks with his party's senior members at a Johannesburg conference centre, the governing party now needs partners to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been speculation the party might seek to form a minority government or a coalition with one or two major parties, but in the end Ramaphosa invited all his rivals to talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such a national dialogue will enhance the pressing task of rebuilding social cohesion in a fractured society, following a particularly toxic and divisive election campaign," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa said ANC negotiators had already held talks with five parties: The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), the National Freedom Party (NFP) and the anti-immigrant Patriotic Alliance (PA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All parties must commit to shared nation building and social cohesion," he said. "These values include respect for the constitution of the Republic of South Africa and the rule of law, social justice and equity, human dignity, non-racialism and non-sexism." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were little changed on Thursday after hitting records a day earlier, as traders awaited data on the labour market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones inched up 0.2 percent to 38,886, while the S&P 500 ended flat at 5,352.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 17,173.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached new highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not uncommon. It seems like every time the market makes a new high, there is not a lot of follow through," said Karl Haeling of LBBW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market movements also came after the European Central Bank lowered interest rates for the first time since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haeling noted that although the ECB cut was anticipated, its tone was "less dovish than expected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All attention is now on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, as traders look for signs that the US central bank may soon follow suit in reducing interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, traders are looking ahead to the latest US employment report due out on Friday indicating the health of the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While hiring has proven more resilient than anticipated in the face of high interest rates, cooling job growth could prompt the Fed to lower rates sooner rather than later.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The jump in imports was largely due to an increase in goods such as automotive vehicles, says the US Commerce Department. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756429_1_20240607034054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US trade deficit expanded slightly less than analysts expected in April, to the widest since late 2022, as imports rose more quickly than exports, according to government data released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overall gap was US$74.6 billion, growing from March's revised US$68.6 billion figure, said the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the largest deficit since October 2022, according to official data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumption has been more resilient than anticipated even as the central bank rapidly hiked interest rates to dampen demand – and this has helped to support imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with weaker global demand, there have been concerns that export growth would not be able to keep up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors are also watching the Federal Reserve for the outcome of its policy meeting next week, looking for hints on when it might start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The early data are pointing to a drag from trade in the second quarter," said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, imports grew by 2.4 percent to US$338.2 billion, while exports rose by 0.8 percent to US$263.7 billion, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jump in imports was largely due to an increase in goods such as automotive vehicles, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goods exports, meanwhile, also picked up but by a smaller degree, with a rise seen in products like pharmaceutical preparations and electric apparatus, data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Imports have been supported by strong domestic demand and lean inventories," said Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exports have contended with a weaker global backdrop and a strong US dollar which makes domestic goods relatively more expensive abroad," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goods deficit with China dropped by US$2.5 billion to US$22.1 billion in April. This was mainly due to a decrease in imports. (AFP)

 Police said they had arrested three people who allegedly insulted the national anthem ahead of a World Cup qualifying match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China were playing against Iran at the Hong Kong Stadium on Thursday in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said three people, aged between 18 and 31, turned their backs towards the pitch when the national anthem was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested on suspicion of insulting the national anthem, and are being detained for further investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Anthem Ordinance came into effect in 2020, stating that people must stand solemnly and must not behave in a disrespectful way when the national anthem is played.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary said two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – have tendered their resignations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung of the Court of Final Appeal “notes with regret” the resignations. He said overseas non-permanent judges, including Lords Collins and Sumption, have made valuable contributions to the top court over the years, and that the Judiciary is committed to upholding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, also expressed regret at the resignations. Lee noted that Lord Collins had stated that he continued to "have the fullest confidence in the Court and the total independence of its members."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Secretary for Justice, Paul Lam, said the Department of Justice expresses regret at the judges' resignations, but was grateful for their past contributions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Collins has been a non-permanent judge of Hong Kong’s highest court since 2011, Lord Sumption since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the pair’s resignations, there are four Hong Kong non-permanent judges and eight non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions at the Court of Final Appeal, with Justice Allsop from Australia the most recent appointee earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.

    Premier League clubs vote to continue using VAR

    <![CDATA[<img alt="According to the league, the number of correct decisions made in games has risen from 82 percent prior to its introduction to 96 percent last season. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756414_1_20240607002233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs voted on Thursday to continue using VAR next season after being asked to consider scrapping the technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the league's annual general meeting, the 20 teams decided against ending the use of video assistant referees for key onfield decisions, despite a series of controversies last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clubs, however, voted to make improvements “for the benefit of the game and supporters.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said it wants to reduce delays to games while decisions are being made, with the introduction of semi-automated offside technology key to that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The technology will provide quicker and consistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking,” it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league also said it wanted to maintain a high threshold for VAR intervention and “more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In-stadium announcements will be introduced to improve fan experience, as well as big screen replays, where possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolverhampton Wanderers submitted a resolution to trigger a vote on the use of VAR last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said VAR “led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VAR has been used in the Premier League since the 2019-20 season. According to the league, the number of correct decisions made in games has risen from 82 percent prior to its introduction to 96 percent last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there have been high-profile errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most notable of those last season came in a game between Tottenham and Liverpool in September when a miscommunication meant Luis Diaz's goal was ruled out despite replays clearly showing the forward was onside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp later called for the game to be replayed after his team’s 2-1 loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said in April that semi-automated offside technology would be introduced in the autumn of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said it would continue to lobby the International Football Association Board, which oversees the laws of football, for greater flexibility to "allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.” (AP)

    Boeing's space capsule springs more helium leaks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner on top. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756405_1_20240606224457.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing’s space capsule developed more leaks during its first test flight with astronauts as it closed in on the International Space Station on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Starliner capsule already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit on Wednesday. Boeing and Nasa managers were confident they could manage the propulsion system despite the problem and that more leaks were unlikely. But just hours into the flight, two more leaks cropped up. There was no immediate word on the size of these new leaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaks pose no safety issues for Nasa test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams or the mission, Boeing spokesman Jim May said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mission managers pressed ahead for a midday docking with the space station while continuing to monitor the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  May said the capsule holds plenty of helium reserves to make up for what's lost. The propulsion system will be disabled once the capsule is docked at the space station since the thrusters will not be needed then, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helium is used to pressurise the fuel lines of Starliner’s thrusters, which are essential for manoeuvering. Before liftoff, engineers devised a plan to work around any additional leaks in the system. A faulty rubber seal, no bigger than a shirt button, is believed responsible for the original leak.

  After the space shuttles retired, Nasa hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX’s taxi service began in 2020. Boeing was supposed to start around the same time, but was held up for years by safety concerns and other troubles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's giant Starship rocket survived reentry through Earth's atmosphere on Thursday and splashed down in the Indian Ocean as planned during its fourth test mission after launching from south Texas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-stage spacecraft, consisting of the Starship cruise vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, broke apart during its last attempt in March to survive a blazingly hot reentry through Earth's atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the craft survived its reentry on Thursday, a SpaceX livestream showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on social media after the splashdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starship, stacked atop its Super Heavy booster, blasted off on Thursday morning from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas. It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of kilometres above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Super Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There, it began its free-fall back to Earth where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric reentry – the crucial point at which it failed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Designed to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship – standing nearly 122 metres tall – represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by Nasa in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 40 kilometres above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating," Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by Nasa as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programmes, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon cancelled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and opposed the House of Representatives of the United States Congress for introducing a resolution which it said “smeared and slandered” the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance as well as law enforcement actions taken by HKSAR law enforcement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR administration said, "The US House of Representatives grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China, violating international law and the basic norms governing international relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR will not be intimidated and will continue to resolutely safeguard national security in accordance with the law," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also said the US was "in no position to point its finger" at the SAR for legitimately passing legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the SAR's legal framework in safeguarding national security was in line with international human rights standards, and the extraterritorial effect for the offences endangering national security also fully aligns with the principles of international law.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Thursday said it planned to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the government consulted the sector last month and received positive feedback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It planned to invite red minibus route operators, who had already joined the HK$2 fare scheme, to switch to green routes, to further ensure the quality of minibus services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said about 70 red minibus routes had joined the fare scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said criteria would be set for those who wished to go green, such as requiring minibus routes to operate for at least five years, have only one fixed route and offer whole-day services, and the route must be run by only one operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes within the month of July, and the department said it would ensure all routes meet the conditions for operating public light buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, red minibuses are allowed to operate across the territory, and their routes, frequency and fares are not subject to any restrictions.

    CE urged to step in to end HKU appointment conflict

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former council members and alumni of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have called on Chief Executive John Lee to put an end to the infighting at the institution, saying they had lost faith in the council's chairperson Priscilla Wong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They wrote a letter to Lee, who is also the university's chancellor, saying the council had appointed several interim vice-presidents without consulting HKU president and vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the council is tasked with giving advice and monitoring HKU's management, but does not directly deal with administrative affairs, adding the body's move had sparked conflicts in HKU and affected its normal operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Lee to step in promptly, or people would have the impression the government had appointed the council chairperson to control HKU and sideline the president, which would harm Hong Kong's international image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the letter's signatories, former executive councillor Fanny Law, told RTHK she "doesn't have an opinion on who should be the vice-presidents," but she cared about the procedures, HKU's reputation and the city's image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party legislator Regina Ip, who sits on HKU's court, an overseeing and legislative body comprising university and lay members, said she hopes the conflict can be settled soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally I think vice-presidents are part of the president's team. No matter who has the power to appoint them, they should consult the president thoroughly. It's better if the president gets along with the vice-presidents and they can work together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Chief Executive's Office said Lee had asked the Education Bureau to comprehend the situation before reporting to him, adding that people would expect HKU, a successful university, to have good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang had earlier criticised the council's action in an email to HKU teaching staff and students, saying it violated established procedures and severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".

<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders on Thursday gathered in Normandy to remember those who fought and died on the beaches of northern France 80 years ago, when Allied forces launched "D-Day" to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Moving letters from veterans were read as ceremonies kicked off to mark the 80th anniversary of the June 6, 1944 D-Day landings, when more than 150,000 Allied soldiers invaded France by sea and air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US leader Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Britain's King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the Allied powers, paid tribute to the tens of thousands of troops who fought on the beaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived to attend the ceremonies and hold talks with the leaders -- a stark reminder of the conflict between his country and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest guests of honour were some 200 surviving veterans in their late 90s or even over 100, some in wheelchairs, huddled in blankets as they gazed over the shores. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A survey by Hong Kong Unison revealed that about 57 percent of Nepalese individuals found discrimination to be a serious problem in the SAR.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating for racial equality on Thursday called on the government to offer language and cultural courses to Nepalese parents and youths to help them integrate into Hong Kong society and prepare them with skills for better employment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A survey by Hong Kong Unison found that one in five Nepalese youths had been sent back to Nepal by their parents for reasons including family problems, forced marriage and drug abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Tse, executive director of the organisation, said authorities need to boost education measures to help local Nepalese youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They should really put their top priority in the field of education, particularly in the learning of Chinese so that if Nepalese students are doing well in school, hopefully they would be successful in their academic career and then have some sort of social mobility," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, unfortunately, because of the language barrier and the lack of education, many of them can't finish secondary school. Even if they can finish secondary school, they would end up finding a really low-level kind of job which is not really good for them in the long run."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 268 adolescents and young adults were interviewed, with almost half saying their biggest concern was the language barrier and the lack of educational support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Limbu Eliza, a Nepalese youth who was born and raised in Hong Kong, said she personally struggled with discrimination and learning Cantonese growing up, which made schooling and finding a job very difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most companies don't hire our ethnic minority (EM) people. Whenever they see you are EM people, [they] don't want to hire you. They will just reject you immediately. No need for interview, you can just go, which is I think unfair for us," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of them, even though they know Cantonese, but [companies] judge us by our colour, our face, our culture, and that is why they will always reject us. I think that is the most difficult thing [about] finding a job in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation also recommended special programmes tailored to Nepalese individuals to combat drug abuse, after the survey noted 70 percent of youth found drug abuse to be a significant problem.

<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK understands that a man known for challenging government policies in court has been arrested on suspicion of scamming the authorities out of different kinds of social benefits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested a man surnamed Kwok, 85, in Cheung Chau on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said he's Kwok Cheuk-kin, often known as the king of judicial reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the man is suspected of making false statements over his income and assets, for the alleged purpose of deceiving the government to receive subsidies such as public housing, fruit money, social security and legal aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the alleged deception took place between 2013 and 2022, and the arrest was made after thorough investigation by the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspect was released on bail and stressed that fraud carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail.

<div class="itemFullText">
 E-cigarettes, flavoured cigarettes and lighting up while in a queue are set to be banned in Hong Kong, as part of measures designed to bring about a "cultural change" when it comes to smoking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A ban on selling or importing alternative smoking products (ASP) came into force more than two years ago, but it is still legal to possess them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee on Thursday said the government plans to outlaw e-cigarettes and similar products completely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One should not be able to have any legal means to purchase or to get hold of such ASP. So anyone who is still using ASP currently... presumably they are using the stocks that they purchased before April 2022," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So a reasonable assumption is that by a certain time... if they possessed any ASP, should have already consumed all of the remaining leftover."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other planned measures aimed at cutting the number of smokers in the SAR include removing branding from cigarette packaging and a ban on smoking while in queues for public transport, theme parks or medical facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke-free areas will also be extended to the entrances and exits of all childcare centres, schools and homes for the elderly. The fine for smoking in smoke-free areas will be doubled to HK$3,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Existing laws banning the sale of cigarettes to under-18s will be extended to cover those who offer them to minors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The key principle is that we want to protect our youngsters, our next generation. So what we are doing now is actually an education process, a cultural change, a behavioural change," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think another important aspect is that through education and promotion, we will educate our young people that they should not receive tobacco products. At the same time, we send a very clear message to the adults that one should not sell, nor should one provide such tobacco products to our young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said the harm of smoking should not be sugar-coated, so flavoured cigarettes will also be banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These flavoured cigarettes with additives are actually like an advertisement trying to hide the irritating taste of the smoke and at the same time hiding the harmful effect of all these tobacco products to make it like a sugar coating on a toxic product," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat illicit cigarettes, the government will introduce a duty-paid cigarette labelling system and double the fine for smuggling illicit cigarettes to HK$2 million, while increasing the jail term from two to seven years. In addition, the government will continue to increase tobacco duty to discourage smoking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the government aims to table the legislative amendments required before the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael, a cigarette smoker, told RTHK that more people will use conventional tobacco products when electronic cigarettes are completely banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that would be illegal, then more people would be returning to buying cigarettes. Because most of them, they try to quit smoking with the electronic cigarettes such as vape," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But then now, if they're going to ban it, then I think it'll be much more difficult for people to quit smoking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-smoker surnamed Chan said she welcomes the government's plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I don't smoke, I support it. I don't really want to inhale second-hand smoke. In the past, for example, when queuing or taking the elevator, there would often be someone next to me smoking. I would just walk away. I wouldn't hang around," she said.

    Privacy watchdog clears exams body over charges

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756346_1_20240606154522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog on Thursday dismissed complaints the local exams regulator had violated privacy laws by overcharging public exam candidates for their marking records and exam script checks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The law stipulates that organisations cannot charge a fee higher than the lowest possibly imposed for people seeking a copy of their personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Examinations and Assessment Authority turned electronic and stopped providing hard copies for those seeking their records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It lowered the fee for checking the first subject by HK$20 to HK$380, and kept the fee for each additional subject unchanged at HK$104.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four candidates who sat last year's DSE exams then filed complaints to the Privacy Commissioner, saying they were charged too much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an investigation, privacy commissioner Ada Chung said the fees charged were already lower than the directly related necessary costs, such as those for payroll and computer operating time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The commissioner found that the fees imposed by the [authority] for complying with the data access requests were not excessive and it had not contravened [the ordinance]," she said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One complainant also argued the exams body had been overcharging for a decade starting from 2012, saying it actually retained scanned copies of the records but only gave people hard copies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chung also said this was unsubstantiated, saying the authority was only providing the data in one form and therefore didn't violate the law.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian officials on Thursday said an Israeli strike on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed up to 40 people, including 23 women and children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat had a hidden Hamas command post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people," Thawabta told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack happened after Israel announced a new military campaign in central Gaza as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There will be more cooperation between the creative industries in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, Culture Secretary Kevin Yeung said on Thursday at an annual meeting on cultural exchanges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “This year's meeting has been very successful, with many collaborative projects showing positive development. It's very encouraging,” he said at the 22nd Greater Pearl River Delta Cultural Cooperation Meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope that this conference framework will guide cultural exchange and cooperation between the three regions, and elevate the depth and breadth of our collaboration to a new level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that over the next five years, the SAR government will allocate HK$135 million to support local art groups and artists in exchange programmes within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also plans to bring more local cultural events, including the Hong Kong Pop Culture Festival, to the bay area, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong’s culture and tourism director general, Li Bin, said creating a well-known cultural tourism brand in the region is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that promotions for art performances and exhibitions will be more closely connected, with more interactions among official accounts on WeChat, Douyin and Xiaohongshu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Macau’s cultural affairs minister, Leong Wai-man, said the city hosted over 2,000 large-scale performances and more than 10,000 cultural events last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Macau could play the role as a major entertainment hub in the bay area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific on Thursday announced that it will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, from October 28.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Air Connectivity Program, which comes under Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cathay Pacific’s CEO Ronald Lam said the new flights will help business and tourism prosper in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Riyadh is a very vibrant city. It is the capital and financial centre of Saudi Arabia. By having direct flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh, we will be contributing to the prosperity of business, trade and tourism between China and Saudi Arabia,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme's CEO, Majid Khan, said the launch of the direct flights will bring more tourists to both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is one of the key markets in terms of tourism and trade from both sides. So we believe Cathay, we're going to grow the point-to-point traffic from both sides between Hong Kong and Riyadh and vice versa, but also the traffic to domestic Saudi Arabia and to the network beyond Hong Kong, where Cathay has a vast network,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay axed a previous service to Riyadh in 2017.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men's and women's national rugby sevens teams are preparing to contend for the final berth at the Olympics next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They will have to win the repechage tournament in Monaco at the end of the month for the trip to Paris and are among 12 entries battling for the last spots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's team are in the same pool with Canada, Great Britain and Uganda, while the women's squad face Poland, Czech Republic and Mexico in pool play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's assistant coach, Zhu Jing, said the most important thing is for the team to fight as one on the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said even though other countries are traditionally considered stronger in rugby sevens, Asians, like Chinese, also have their own advantages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of potential, actually Chinese people have quite an advantage. Because we have speed and agility. When we play we are actually better in these attributes compared to players from Europe or the Americas," Zhu told Hong Kong reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach said he's looking forward to seeing good performances from a couple of players. He said Shan Changshun and the captain, Li Haitao, have good physique and awareness on the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, for his part, said the team was focusing on improving their fitness ahead of the do-or-die tournament, as well as working on tactical adjustments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Making the Olympics for sure is every athlete's ultimate dream. We'll do our best yeah, do our best to get that ticket to Paris," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all in good shape, training with great enthusiasm. Also, in everyday life we're all very united as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the players were having extra sessions in the weight room, and the sports science team has helped their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he thinks the team's biggest foes are themselves, and all they need to do is to give it their best shot.

  At least 20 people suffered light injuries and another three were more seriously hurt in the crash which occurred after 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) in Pardubice, along the country's main rail corridor from Prague to the east, Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passenger train, operated by RegioJet, was travelling overnight from Prague to Kosice in eastern Slovakia, according to the Railway Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fire Rescue Services said more than 300 passengers were on board. Dozens of police, fire and emergency service units responded to the accident, helping evacuate carriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage after the crash on news website idnes.cz showed at least one carriage off the track, while police showed on their X social media account a line of emergency service vehicles and a helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech Television cited a fire brigade spokesperson saying the freight train was carrying calcium carbide, although the first two wagons were empty, so no leak occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Martin Kupka, who travelled with the interior minister to the crash site, told a televised briefing an investigation into the accident was beginning and it was too early to speculate on its cause. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), following years of technical problems, delays and a 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad from Florida's Atlantic Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 400 kilometres above Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will need to execute precise manoeuvres to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts - Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams - to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wants the Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wrote on social media that Starliner "has reached a safe, stable orbit on its Crew Flight Test" and is headed to the space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner ascends to the heavens," NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the US space agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson called the launch "a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index pushed to new highs on Wednesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs on Wednesday, powered mainly by technology stocks as markets digested economic data that could support a much-expected start to the Federal Reserve's policy easing cycle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to end at 5,354, the Nasdaq Composite gained just under two percent to 17,187. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 percent to 38,807.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The May private payrolls report on Wednesday became the latest data to suggest an easing in labour market tightness that could propel the Fed to begin cutting rates this year. A report on Tuesday showed job openings fell in April to the fewest in more than three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're seeing the economic data starting to ease up a little bit and the repercussions for that is that you're seeing the pressure on rates come off the boil a little bit mixed in with the potential for weaker economic data, which is a pretty good recipe for the bond market," said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a nearly 69 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Expectations had hovered around 50 percent last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US 10-year Treasury yields fell to a two-month low on Wednesday after a report pointed to weaker-than-expected job growth ahead of Friday's highly anticipated government employment report for May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip stocks leapt, buoyed by gains to Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both touched record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose after forecasting third-quarter revenue above Street expectations, helped by upbeat demand for its AI servers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel gained after buyout firm Apollo Global Management agreed to purchase 49 percent for US$11 billion in a joint venture related to the chipmaker's Ireland manufacturing unit. (Reuters)

    Modi to be sworn in as Indian PM on Saturday

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Narendra Modi is expected to be sworn in as Indian prime minister on Saturday. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756276_1_20240606034343.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hindu-nationalist party of Narendra Modi agreed with allies on Wednesday to form a government after a general election in which it failed to secure an outright majority for the first time in a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-member National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition -- led by Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- has 293 seats in parliament, giving it control of the legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all unanimously choose respected NDA leader Narendra Modi as our leader," a BJP-issued alliance statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the NDA government would "preserve India's heritage" and work for the "all-round development of the country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election results released on Tuesday upended conventional wisdom throughout the six-week election that Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda would power him to a landslide win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said Modi's reliance on coalition partners means he faces the prospect of a far tougher-than-expected third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will force Modi to take the point of view of others -- we shall see more democracy and a healthy parliament," said Nilanajan Mukhopadhyay, who has written a biography of Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will have to be a leader that he has never been; we will have to see a new Modi."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian media reports said Modi would be sworn in as prime minister on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China congratulated Modi earlier on Wednesday and said it was "ready to work" with its neighbour, while Japan also applauded the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, 73, insisted on Tuesday night that the election results were a victory that ensured he would continue his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our third term will be one of big decisions and the country will write a new chapter of development," Modi told a crowd of cheering supporters in the capital New Delhi after his win. "This is Modi's guarantee." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mirra Andreeva fought back to defeat second seed Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756273_1_20240606024121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's Mirra Andreeva became the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist since 1997 with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka, who was struggling with an apparent illness, at the French Open on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old fought back from a set down against her ailing opponent to win 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-4 after two hours and 29 minutes and set up a last-four meeting with Italy's Jasmine Paolini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, aged 17 and 29 days, is the youngest woman to make the semis at a major event since Martina Hingis at the US Open 27 years ago and also the youngest at Roland Garros since Hingis in 1997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly I was really nervous before the match, I knew she'd have an advantage," said Andreeva, who had lost both her previous meetings with Sabalenka in straight sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I see the game, I play whenever I want, I don't really have a plan. When I see an open space on the court I try to play, I try to play behind her back or something like this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Me and my coach, we had a plan today but again I didn't remember anything. I just try to play as I feel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will fancy her chances of going all the way to the final when she faces Paolini -- who had never got past the second round at a Grand Slam before this year -- on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka called for multiple medical time-outs as she complained of not feeling well and Andreeva, playing in her maiden Slam quarter-final, eventually took advantage with a composed display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka had powered through the first four rounds but was clearly having difficulties, breathing heavily between points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, currently ranked 38th, had already secured a breakthrough into the world's top 30 with her run to the last eight, but is now poised to rise further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tournament favourite Iga Swiatek plays US Open champion Coco Gauff in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka had been targeting a seventh straight Slam semi-final and had won 11 consecutive matches at the majors following her second Melbourne title earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was immediately clear that Sabalenka was not at her best, as she made four double-faults across her opening two service games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva suffered from nerves in key moments, failing to serve out the first set when leading 5-4, before Sabalenka rallied to take a tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It appeared as though Sabalenka would race away from her young rival -- the youngest woman to make the quarter-finals since 2005 -- when she broke in the first game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva hit straight back, with Sabalenka continuing to shake her head and crouch down between points in apparent pain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair traded breaks once more before Sabalenka again called for the trainer, saying she needed "something to make me feel better".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva was starting to get on top and levelled the match on her second set point as Sabalenka dumped a tired backhand into the bottom of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka was still grimacing and complaining towards her box early in the third set, but suddenly found her groove to break to love for a 3-2 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She could not back it up with a hold, though, as Andreeva quickly drew level and then moved 5-4 ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka failed to extend the contest behind her own serve as Andreeva sealed a famous victory in fine style, with a magnificent lob from way behind the baseline. (AFP)

    World's temperatures likely to breach 1.5 degrees: UN

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Climate change is taking a heavy toll around the world, fuelling extreme weather, flooding and drought. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756271_1_20240606021738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Humanity now faces an 80 percent chance that Earth's temperatures will at least temporarily exceed the key 1.5-degree Celsius mark during the next five years, the UN predicted on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2015 Paris climate accords, which set the ambitious target of limiting the world to a temperature increase of 1.5 C over pre-industrial levels, meant to refer "to long-term temperature increases over decades, not over one to five years", the UN's World Meteorological Organization said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report came alongside another by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service announcing that last month was the hottest May on record, pointing to human-induced climate change -- and spurring UN chief Antonio Guterres to compare humanity's impact on the world to "the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chance of temporarily exceeding the limit in the next five years ahead has been rising steadily since 2015, when such a chance was estimated to be close to zero, the UN's weather and climate agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is an 80 percent likelihood that the annual average global temperature will temporarily exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for at least one of the next five years," WMO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, the risk of temporarily breaching the limit within five years was estimated at 66 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already, dramatic climate shifts have begun taking a heavy toll worldwide, fuelling extreme weather events, flooding and drought, while glaciers are rapidly melting away and sea levels are rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on a record-breaking warming path," WMO deputy chief Ko Barrett told reporters in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "WMO is sounding the alarm that we will be exceeding the 1.5 C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that "we have already temporarily surpassed this level for individual months".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barrett noted though that temporary breaches "do not mean that the 1.5 C goal is permanently lost because this refers to long-term warming over decades".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the trend is alarming and cannot be denied."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperature levels are rising, with 2023 by far the hottest year on record, amid warnings that 2024 could be even hotter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, the WMO predicts that the mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2024 and 2028 will be 1.1-1.9 C above the pre-industrial levels recorded between 1850 and 1900.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to repeated monthly temperature records over the past year, the WMO highlighted that already the past 12 months, from June 2023 to May 2024, were "the highest on record".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it said there was now an 86-percent chance that one of the years between 2024 and 2028 would unseat 2023 as the annual record-holder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said there was a 90-percent likelihood that the mean temperature for 2024-2028 would be higher than that over the past five-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are way off track to meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement," Barrett said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The SAR government has issued a statement setting the record straight about both the SAR and China. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756265_1_20240606003614.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday hit back at criticism by "some individuals" of the city's  economic and financial development, which it said had "clearly overlooked the existing advantages and the current positive development momentum of Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said in a statement that it intended to set the record straight, saying China's real economic growth rates in the first quarter and for all of 2023 were both above five percent, "ranking it among the fastest-growing major economies in the world".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It quoted an International Monetary Fund study which had concluded that the Mainland economy contributed to more than 30 per cent of global economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the SAR was also growing steadily, increasing by 3.3 per cent in 2023, and notching up year-on-year real gross domestic product growth of 2.7 percent. It said it was estimated to grow by 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also defended the city's status as a financial hub, saying Hong Kong stocks market capitalisaion exceeds HK$33 trillion, which is 10 times higher than at the time of the handover in 1997, while Stock Connect had also brought about a cumulative northbound and southbound capital flows of more than 1.8 trillion yuan and HK$3.1 trillion respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These figures demonstrate that Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, has fully utilised its ability to mobilise both Mainland and foreign capital, and will continue to play a key role in helping to 'bring in' international enterprises and investors, as well as assisting mainland enterprises to 'go out',"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also singled out other highlights in the stock market, including the average daily transaction volume of Exchange Traded Funds on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange exceeding HK$13 billion in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the China Securities Regulatory Commission had also recently announced five new measures to support the development of Hong Kong's financial sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the one country, two systems principle was the cornerstone of the city's prosperity, and the Basic Law protected freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its successful implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and Safeguarding National Security Ordinance had "brought about a safe and stable environment conducive to investment and financial development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this year, a survey conducted by a major foreign chamber of commerce reflected that nearly 80 per cent of its members interviewed had confidence in the rule of law in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 per cent of them also indicated that the operation of their enterprises had not been affected by the National Security Law," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It underlined Hong Kong's status in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Various data and facts not only reflect the performance of Hong Kong's economic and financial development, but more importantly, highlight Hong Kong's unique advantages and strategic position under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as well as its resilience and flexibility, in the face of global instability," it said. "Despite the fact that external environment will remain complicated, the Mainland and Hong Kong's economic growth is steadily improving, and even in a faster pace than some developed economies."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Google parent Alphabet must face a lawsuit worth up to 13.6 billion pounds for allegedly abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit, which seeks damages on behalf of publishers of websites and apps based in the United Kingdom, is the latest case to focus on the search giant's business practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action is bringing the claim on behalf of publishers who say they have suffered losses due to Google's allegedly anti-competitive behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google last month urged the CAT to block the case, which it argued was incoherent. The company "strongly rejects the underlying allegations", its lawyers said in court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CAT said in a written ruling that it would certify the case to proceed towards a trial, which is unlikely to take place before the end of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tribunal also emphasised the test for certifying a case under the UK's collective proceedings regime – which is roughly equivalent to the United States' class action regime – is relatively low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Google works constructively with publishers across the UK and Europe," Google legal director Oliver Bethell said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bethell added: "This lawsuit is speculative and opportunistic. We'll oppose it vigorously and on the facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Claudio Pollack, a partner of Ad Tech Collection Action, said: "This is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google's anti-competitive conduct in ad tech. Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action's case comes amid ongoing probes by regulators into Google's adtech business, including by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google is also fighting two lawsuits in the United States, one brought by the Department of Justice and another by Texas and other states, accusing the company of anti-competitive conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google's lawyers said in documents for the CAT case that the company's "impact in the ad tech industry has been hugely pro-competitive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wednesday's decision is the latest against a tech giant to be given the green light by the CAT, which already this year has certified a US$3.8 billion case against Facebook parent Meta and a nearly US$1 billion case against Apple. (Reuters)

    Australia admits defeat in battle against X

    <![CDATA[<img alt="X, formerly Twitter, was criticised after video of an attack in a church spread widely on social media and sparked a riot. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756263_1_20240605234336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's online watchdog on Wednesday dropped a legal effort to force Elon Musk's X to remove posts depicting the violent stabbing of a Sydney priest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have decided to discontinue the proceedings in the Federal Court against X Corp," eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog had ordered Musk's company to globally remove about 65 video and audio clips of the April 15 non-fatal attack in a church.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But X challenged the commission's right to make a global takedown order, arguing that geoblocking users in Australia was enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog had argued X's measures were easily dodged with the use of popular location-masking services like VPN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant -- a former Twitter employee -- defended the decision to take legal action: "I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disputed posts showed Assyrian orthodox Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel being stabbed about six times during a live-streamed sermon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video of the attack, which spread widely on social media and sparked a riot by followers of the church in western Sydney, has been blamed by Australian authorities for feeding tensions in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 16-year-old has been charged with "committing a terrorist act" in relation to the attack, which is said to have been religiously motivated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eSafety Commissioner said most Australians accepted that such graphic material should not be broadcast on television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This "begs an obvious question of why it should be allowed to be distributed freely and accessible online 24/7 to anyone, including children," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant said X routinely took down content globally, citing its removal of a compilation video of a knifeman's rampage in a Sydney shopping mall in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other major platforms had complied with the watchdog's requests and removal notices related to the church attack, she said, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Snap, TikTok, Reddit and Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is because the video violated their terms of service and their standards of decency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant said she now "welcomed the opportunity" for a merits-based review of her decision by the country's Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her decision to drop the case followed a setback last month when the Federal Court refused to extend the order for a global ban while the court case was being fought. (AFP)

    HKU head says wasn't told about new appointments

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756251_1_20240605220920.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president and vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Zhang Xiang, on Wednesday confirmed he wasn't told about new senior staff appointments by the HKU council, saying it severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an email to HKU teaching staff and students, Zhang said the council's move to appoint several interim vice-presidents without consulting him violated established procedures and disregarded the fundamentals of good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the University of Hong Kong Ordinance and Statutes, the president was granted the authority to appoint temporary senior management officers, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Neither were the nominations for these interim vice-presidents recommended by me, nor was I consulted about them. The university management did not have prior knowledge of these appointments at all," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stability and development of our University, as well as the reputation of Hong Kong, are now at risk, not to mention the negative impact on our efforts to attract global talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes reportedly include a demotion for Richard Wong, Zhang’s right-hand man and deputy vice-chancellor, who had served as the university’s interim provost since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that Wong had been appointed as a vice-president and would oversee institutional advancement, while his original post would be taken up by Vivian Yam, a professor at the science faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Zhang said he was thrilled that HKU had ranked higher than ever before in the new QS World University Rankings, adding he was dedicated to leading the institution to new heights and positioning it alongside the world's leading universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU climbed up nine places to 17 on QS’s list of the world’s top universities.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 16,000 pupils - or 84 percent of the intake - were accepted into their top three schools in this year's central allocation of Primary One places on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau earlier announced that a total of 19,204 children took part in the central allocation exercise, and the overall satisfaction rate was 92.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau reminded parents to register their child with the school allocated from next Tuesday to Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some parents were happy with the outcome, while others went to their targeted schools for interviews as a last resort to compete for the remaining few places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parent lined up outside a primary school in Yau Ma Tei from 9am for "door knocking" and tried his luck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We live nearby and the school is famous. [My kid] has prepared by earning some certificates and participated in competitions. But I'm not very optimistic, because the school is quite popular," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School in Wong Tai Sin said it was unfair that it was only allowed to operate one Primary One class instead of two, saying it had admitted at least 31 pupils this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the bureau said the decision was based on established mechanisms because the total number of students admitted was less than 41.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain on Wednesday paid tribute to those who took part in D-Day, promising to "always remember" the sacrifices made by the Allied soldiers who invaded France by sea and air to drive out the forces of Nazi Germany in the World War II operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With guests waving British flags, appearances from veterans, recollections and readings - and some tears in Queen Camilla's eyes - the British ceremony took place in Portsmouth, the main departure point for the 5,000 ships that headed to Normandy on June 6, 1944.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we come together to honour those nearly 160,000 British, Commonwealth and Allied troops who, on 5th June 1944, assembled here and along these shores to embark on the mission which would strike that blow for freedom and be recorded as the greatest amphibious operation in history," King Charles said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, as we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory, whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us, once again, commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day and to live up to the freedom they died for."
  <br/>
  <br/>

    New teaching kit to help autistic teens make friends

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two social welfare groups on Wednesday introduced a new teaching kit to help teenagers with autism make friends, saying they often find it hard to fit in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Family Planning Association and Wai Ji Christian Service worked together to design games and story cards that teach autistic teens to interact with others in different social scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Fung, a clinical psychologist with the Christian group, said autistic children struggle to read other people’s emotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Their main difficulty is they don't really recognise the facial expression or the reaction from others. Therefore, they might have a lot of difficulties recognising their reaction and coming up with an appropriate response to them,” she said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, said the teaching kit helps them understand what's expected in social situations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With these stories shown to them, they can actually say, 'Oh, this is what people expected, this is what's going wrong.' So they can learn from seeing. They can learn from understanding,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published by the Census and Statistics Department showed that 22,400 people are living with autism in Hong Kong as of 2020, making up 0.3 percent of the total population.

    Subpar taxi fleets could be banned: authorities

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government hopes new taxi fleets will drive up service quality. File photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756208_1_20240605164135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fleets set to hit the streets of Hong Kong could be suspended from doing business if their service quality isn't up to scratch, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department is currently vetting 15 applications for taxi fleet licences, with up to five successful bidders expected to be announced in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to questions from lawmaker Edward Leung, Acting Transport Secretary Liu Chun-san said taxi fleet operators will need to take part in a mid-term appraisal and their performance would be taken into account should they wish to renew their licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport commissioner would be able to initiate an inquiry should a fleet fail to meet the required standards and a number of sanctions would be available, such as a licence suspension or withdrawing certain taxis from the fleet, Liu said in a written reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year saw a 75 percent surge in complaints against taxi drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of the 1,006 cases filed to the authorities were related to drivers refusing hire, while another 340 cabbies were accused of overcharging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But authorities cautioned that the jump in complaints came against a low base of comparison in 2022, when Hong Kong was still curtailed by Covid restrictions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Wednesday said they had arrested five people on suspicion of selling counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetic products in Mong Kok worth around HK$620,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were suspected to have violated the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested were three men and two women aged between 28 and 90.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An investigator from the Customs and Excise Department, Kenny Chan, said that salespersons, working for a supplier, brought the goods to retailers to sell at low prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspected counterfeit items were found in an operation on Tuesday, when officers searched three retail outlets in Mong Kok and a warehouse in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said it was difficult for customers to tell the difference between genuine and counterfeit goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he noted that while the packaging and bottles of the suspected counterfeits looked real enough, some of the anti-counterfeiting features were not done in a detailed manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you compare the real goods to the counterfeit ones, the pattern at the bottom of the bottles is different. It's smooth for the genuine goods and relatively rough for the fakes," Chan said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can also see that the trademarks printed on the genuine goods are clear whereas for the counterfeits they are not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan believed that some of the counterfeit goods had already been sold on the market, but officers had not received any complaints from the public so far, such as the products causing skin rashes or other more serious issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said samples of the goods would be sent to the government laboratory for tests.

 A tourism project involving the use of augmented reality (AR) technology has been expanded to Lei Yue Mun, allowing people to learn more about the cultural and historical development of the area famous for its seafood.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Visitors can use a mobile app to scan AR markers at six locations along the harbourfront to see a panorama mixing photos from the past and drawings of what the surroundings looked like from the 1920s to the 1970s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Narrative texts describe the changes to iconic landmarks, such the Tin Hau Temple, Sam Ka Tsuen and the past quarry zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "City in Time" project was launched by the Tourism Commission in 2021, with the initial phase featuring popular tourist spots like Central, The Peak and Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Project manager Yip Tsz-lam said the programme has now been extended to other communities rich in culture or history, such as Lei Yue Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most people know Lei Yue Mun as a seafood paradise, but through our research, we discovered that there are many other interesting historical values in Lei Yue Mun, like the quarrying history, the Hakka culture and also the Tin Hau Temple,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about the panoramic artwork. Visitors can also gain in-depth understanding through the historical narratives and also the old photos.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said it took the research team half a year to gather about 300 old photos to recreate a realistic scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are not many old photos available from universities or any other sources. We rely on the descriptions from villagers and they also provided us with a lot of photos from their family albums,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we're very grateful that a restaurant owner provided us with a photo of him and his father in the 1970s. We provided that photo to the artist and the artist drew them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip added that the programme will later be expanded to Tai Hang and Kowloon City.

    Courtesy ambassadors to improve taxi relations

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Taxi Council on Wednesday said that courtesy ambassadors would be stationed at some of the SAR's busiest taxi stands, including at checkpoints and the airport, from June 6 to August 27, to distribute leaflets and souvenirs to passengers and drivers to encourage better service.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The exercise is part of this year's annual taxi courtesy campaign in conjunction with the Tourism Board's hospitality campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, the Taxi Council's chairman Ryan Wong said he hopes this new measure could improve the image of taxi drivers, and also improve communication between drivers and passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have hired university students to be our courtesy ambassadors. Our council has provided them with some training so that they understand the purpose of our campaign and also the services they will provide," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, in addition to our courtesy ambassadors, members of the council will also be on site. If there are questions that the students cannot answer, like industry-related questions, our members can help can help out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick added that service would also be enhanced with more taxis incorporating electronic payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that there are several systems that are available and [are being] installed in the taxi fleets now," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By the introduction of the taxi fleet management scheme by the government, they are required to put this electronic payment system in there, so I'm sure that the situation will start to improve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who RTHK spoke to said that taxi services have improved over the years, but there are other aspects that could make journeys more enjoyable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daria, who takes a taxi two to three times a week, said a lot of old taxis have been replaced with more comfortable and newer vehicles, but said it is difficult to hail a cab, especially during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe have a better app, but right now, it doesn't work properly so for me, I cannot really order a taxi. The taxi drivers never pick up my order, so if they can [provide] more digital [options] to find taxis faster, it would be great," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, I've never experienced any rude behaviour to be honest, but also I know on the news, there are a few accidents involved where taxi drivers are quite old. I think authorities should limit the age as well because it might be dangerous for both the passenger and for the taxi driver."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krauchi, who takes a taxi to work every day, said it would be better if cabs accepted electronic payments, especially with rival Uber being cashless.
