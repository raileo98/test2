<div class="itemFullText">
 Joris Daudet led a French clean sweep of the podium in men's Olympic BMX racing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His compatriots Sylvain Andre and Romain Mahieu took silver and bronze in front of an ecstatic home crowd in the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines stadium, finally winning the Olympic medals that had so long eluded them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French have dominated BMX racing in recent decades, amassing 50 gold medals at world championships since 1982, and Daudet and Mahieu are first and second in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Olympics, however, they had only bagged two medals - both by female riders - since the sport's debut in Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Dutchman Niek Kimmann unable to defend his Tokyo 2021 title due to illness and Tokyo silver medalist Kye Whyte of Britain hampered by a back injury, the French dominated their semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron, the three French riders shot out of the starting ramp and maintained their lead throughout the final, zooming over the bumpy, winding course in a 1-2-3 formation like one blue-and-white streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BMX race, Saya Sakakibara of Australia won gold, Manon Veenstra of the Netherlands took silver and Zoe Claessens of Switzerland claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sakakibara and Mahieu, who are dating each other, will go home with a medal each - one gold, one bronze - at the same Games and in the same discipline. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street took a dive on Friday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764530_1_20240803044225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday following a disappointing US jobs report that raised recession worries while also boosting the odds of interest rate cuts by the Fed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy added 114,000 jobs last month, a drop from the prior month and fewer than expected, while the jobless rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest level since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report added to recession fears following lacklustre manufacturing data on Thursday, with losses in the week's final two days leaving all three major indices down for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 39,737, down 1.5 percent for the day and 2.1 percent for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 fell 1.8 percent to 5,346, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.4 percent to 16,776.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Historically it's very difficult to achieve a soft landing," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. "It's easy for a soft landing to sneak up on you and become a hard landing. And that's what the market is very much afraid of right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said the market is likely overreacting to a few weak data points, noting that most of the corporate earnings released in the last few weeks have been solid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are ready to shoot first and ask questions later," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Intel shares sank more than 26 percent after the US chip maker announced it would cut more than 15 percent of its workforce while reporting a US$1.6 billion quarterly loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon also had a bad day, losing nearly nine percent on worries about the tech giant's profit outlook after revenues fell short of expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Apple advanced 0.7 percent after reporting quarterly profit of US$21.4 billion, besting analyst forecasts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coca-Cola rose 2.0 percent as it announced plans to pay a tax penalty worth US$6 billion while it pursues an appeal in a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soft drinks giant had previously said the dispute could potentially involve a liability of US$16 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 52-year-old Hong Kong man has drowned on the Thai resort island of Phuket while swimming with his teenage son, it emerged on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department confirmed receiving a request for help from the man's family, and pledged to render all necessary assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Thai media, the duo decided to take a dip at the famous Patong beach on Wednesday when the father began drifting away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His son notified lifesavers, who pulled the man ashore on a jet ski. He was already unconscious and was eventually pronounced dead in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said it had contacted the Chinese consulate in the southern Thai province of Songkhla, with the help of the Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said the department will remain in close contact with all relevant parties and provide assistance according to the family's wishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR residents needing help overseas are urged to call its 24-hour hotline, (852)1868, or send a message through WhatsApp using the same number.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei won the men's 10,000 metres gold medal at the Paris Olympics on Friday, the first track medal of the athletics programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time world champion in the 10,000 metres made his move on the final lap and surged in the last 100 metres to cross the finish line in an Olympic record time of 26 minutes, 43.14 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Berihu Aregawi took silver and American Grant Fisher claimed the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Barely 16 years ago when I was watching the great Kenenisa Bekele win in Beijing, it was something that grew in my heart," said Cheptegei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said, 'one day I want to be Olympic champion'. It is the most special day. I can’t describe the feeling. I’ve wanted this for a long time. When I took silver in Tokyo I was so disappointed. I just wanted to win the 10,000m."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, there was an explosive start to the Olympic track and field competition at the Stade de France when the United States mixed 4x400m relay broke the world record to qualify in first place for the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quartet of Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Bryce Deadmon and Kaylyn Brown timed 3 minutes, 7.41 seconds, smashing the previous best of 3:08.80 set when the US won world gold in Budapest last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wanted to come out here and execute good hand-offs," said Norwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We set the tone for the rest of the United States with that world record."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's decathlon, Germany's Leo Neugebauer tops the standings with 4,650 points at the half-way mark, with the second part of the competition to be held the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Dutch long-distance star Sifan Hassan launched her audacious bid for an unprecedented Olympic treble with a confident performance in the opening round of the women's 5,000 metres on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old Olympic champion is aiming to become the first woman in history to win 5,000m, 10,000m and marathon gold at the same Olympics, emulating Czech great Emil Zatopek, who achieved the men's triple at the 1952 Helsinki Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China added a silver and a bronze to their haul in the men's trampoline, while reigning champion Ivan Litvinovich successfully defended his Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Yan Langyu and 18-year-old Wang Zisai were hoping to dethrone Litvinovich, the Belarusian who competed as an "individual neutral athlete" because of his nation's involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, who started third in the eight-man final, briefly led the pack with a score of 61.89 while Yan was close behind in second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were judged by their routine's difficulty, execution, horizontal displacement and time of flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Litvinovich was second last to go, and he withstood pressure to win in 63.09.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leon Marchand demonstrated again on Friday why many consider him the best swimmer of his generation as he stormed to his fourth individual gold medal in the pool at La Defense Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French star took command on the backstroke leg of the men's 200m individual medley and never looked back, winning in an Olympic record time of 1 minutes, 54.06 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Duncan Scott won his second straight silver in the event while defending champion Wang Shun of China settled for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand is the first French athlete to take four individual golds, as opposed to team ones, at a single Summer Games and only the third male swimmer to do so after Americans Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's incredible, it was really magical," the 22-year-old told French TV. "The whole stadium was fully behind me and I took advantage of it. It enabled me to win four medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a good night for Australia as the Dolphins came away with two more gold medals from the meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaylee McKeown cemented her place among the greats of Olympic swimming on Friday as she became the first woman to retain both of the backstroke titles with gold in the 200m event in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old world record holder once again overhauled American challenger Regan Smith in a battle royale to claim the win in an Olympic record of 2 minutes, 3.73 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith took silver, 0.53 seconds behind her Australian nemesis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kylie Masse took bronze for Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Australia's Cameron McEvoy took his first Olympic gold medal when he won the men's 50 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Ben Proud took the silver medal, and France's Florent Manaudou the bronze - 12 years after he won gold at London 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel of the United States finished sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McEvoy is the first Australian man to win the shortest distance on the programme. (Reuters)

    Judge suspends Justin Timberlake's NY driver's licence

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The police allege that in June Justin Timberlake ran a stop sign, veered out of his lane and got out of his BMW reeking of alcohol. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764523_1_20240803031359.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Timberlake made a virtual court appearance on Friday in his drunken driving case on Long Island, saying little during the brief proceeding as a judge accepted his not-guilty plea and suspended his right to drive in New York.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police in the seaside village of Sag Harbor arrested Timberlake June 18 after they say he ran a stop sign, veered out of his lane and got out of his BMW smelling of alcohol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former NSYNC singer, who is on tour in Europe, wasn't required by the court to return to the US for his court date. He is performing on Saturday night in Antwerp, Belgium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorney, Edward Burke Jr, has maintained that Timberlake was not drunk and that the case should be dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The facts remain he was not intoxicated,” Burke said on Friday, according to Newsday. “I’ll say it again: Justin Timberlake was not intoxicated and we’re very confident that charge, that criminal charge, will be dismissed.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor Village Justice Carl Irace suspended Timberlake's Tennessee driver's licence in New York state and threatened to impose a gag order on Burke, saying the attorney's comments to the media have been inappropriate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irace set a next court date for August 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake had appeared in court in person previously but his arraignment needed to be repeated because of a paperwork oversight. Burke said the original charging document lacked a police sergeant’s signature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Attorney Ashley Cangro said new documents were filed July 2 to address that flaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was pulled over after leaving a Sag Harbor hotel around 12:30 am, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odour of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardised field sobriety tests,” police said in a court filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake, 43, told the officer he had had one martini and was following some friends home, according to police. He was arrested and spent the night in custody at a police station. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris effectively secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination on Friday, confirming her remarkable rise to party standard bearer in November's showdown against Republican Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Harris was the sole candidate on the ballot for a five-day electronic vote of nearly 4,000 party convention delegates. She will be officially crowned at a Chicago convention later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am honoured to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States," Harris, 59, said on a phone-in to a party celebration after securing enough votes by the second day of the marathon vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the two weeks since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Harris has gained full control of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other Democrats stepped forward to challenge her elevation to the top of the ticket, making her confirmation as the first black and south Asian woman ever to secure a major party's nomination a formality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came with Harris preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for a swing across seven crucial battleground states with her newly minted running mate – who is expected to be revealed within days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democratic Party decided on a virtual nomination process – mirroring the pandemic-hit 2020 vote – because of Ohio's August 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The virtual roll call marks the official beginning of the 2024 convention, although in practice the festivities really get going when thousands of party faithful descend on Chicago on August 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will feature ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate in what is expected to be a raucous celebration of her rise from state politics to the top of the ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's White House bid was thrown into chaos on July 21 when Biden, 81, withdrew his candidacy, backing Harris as the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice president has already smashed fundraising records, packed arenas and wiped out Trump's polling leads over Biden, creating momentum that she hopes she can ride through the convention to the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is set to make her first public appearance with her running mate on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state whose Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is among a handful candidates being vetted to potentially join the Harris ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swing will take Harris through all the "blue wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where she will seek to rebuild the coalition that carried Biden to victory in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she will extend the tour to the much more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Georgia, North Carolina Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada as she seeks to shore up the black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats. (AFP)

    Weak jobs data sparks worries about US economy

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data shows US unemployment edging up to 4.3 percent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764508_1_20240803000230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with sustained higher interest rates taking a toll on businesses and consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Friday’s report from the US Labor Department showed that employers added just 114,000 jobs in July – 35 percent fewer than forecasters had expected – and that unemployment, now up to 4.3 percent, was the highest since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news shook financial markets around the world, with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both dropping sharply at the open of trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sturdiness of the US economy — the world’s largest — has been a key driver of global economic growth and the US jobs market is a big reason for it, underpinning the American expansion and giving consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unemployment rate's jump to 4.3 percent in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signalled that the United States is in recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the topsy-turvy post-pandemic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weak jobs report came two days after the Federal Reserve said it would hold off on cutting interest rates until it sees more evidence that inflation is continuing to move down and closer to its 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterised the American job market as healthy, despite growing calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high, to pre-empt a major weakening of the US economy and job market. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mourners and supporters bid farewell on Friday in Qatar to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after his killing in Tehran, blamed on Israel, has heightened regional tensions as the Gaza war dragged on.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of people gathered at the Gulf emirate's largest mosque, where Haniyeh's casket, draped in a Palestinian flag, was taken before leaving again for burial in Lusail, north of Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh, the Palestinian armed group's political chief, played a key role in mediated talks aimed at ending nearly 10 months of war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His killing triggered calls for revenge and raised questions about the continued viability of such negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mourners lined up for funeral prayers inside Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Mosque, while others prayed on mats outside in temperatures that reached 44 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony ended in angry chants, but the short-lived demonstration quickly dispersed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was a symbol, a resistance leader... people are angry," said Taher Adel, 25, a Jordanian student residing in the Qatari capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's predecessor Khaled Meshaal spoke at the ceremony, saying the slain leader had "served his cause, his people... and never abandoned them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday to honour Haniyeh, while Hamas called for a "day of furious rage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan were among the officials at the funeral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ismail Hanyieh is a symbol for all Muslims," said Qatari Ahmed Mahmoud, 48, at the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There must be a reaction. Israel must know we will defend ourselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the president of the United Arab Emirates, said his country – which in 2020 normalised ties with Israel – rejects "violence and political assassination in all its forms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Doha mourners wore scarves that combined the Palestinian flag with a checkered keffiyeh pattern and the message in English: "Free Palestine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on their accommodation in Tehran on Wednesday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said. Haniyeh was in Iran to attend the swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing of Qatar-based Haniyeh is among several incidents since April that have sent regional tensions soaring during the Gaza war, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian officials met with representatives of these groups on Wednesday to discuss the next steps, said a source close to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting and requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met with his visiting British counterpart John Healey on Friday and stressed "the importance of establishing a coalition" to support "Israel's defence against Iran and its proxies," Gallant's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France urged its nationals visiting Iran to leave "due to the increased risk of a military escalation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Gaza war, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire, and did so again on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, the civil defence agency reported several people killed in the territory's north, and Israel's military said it had killed around 30 militants near Rafah, in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's assassination came hours after Israel struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Lebanese Hamas ally Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's deputy, Saleh al-Aruri, was killed in Beirut early this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another high-profile killing, Israel's army on Thursday confirmed that an air strike in July killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "delivered crushing blows to all our enemies," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh in Tehran, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times, citing Middle Eastern officials, has reported that Haniyeh was killed by an explosive device planted weeks ago at a Tehran guesthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the report, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists "there was no other Israeli aerial attack... in all the Middle East" on the night of Shukr's killing in Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said Shukr's assassination – for which Hezbollah said retaliation was "inevitable" – was a response to rocket fire which killed 12 youths last week in the annexed Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian news agency Fars said the US report was a "lie," insisting that the Hamas leader was killed by a "projectile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analyst Hugh Lovatt said Haniyeh's killing at the very least "will mean that a ceasefire deal with Israel is now totally off of the table."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu by telephone on Thursday and affirmed his commitment to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the basis for a ceasefire (in Gaza)... They should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong smashed their way to a gold medal in the mixed doubles badminton event on Friday at the Paris Olympics, beating Kim Won-ho and Jeong Na-eun of South Korea in straight sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Japanese pair of Yuta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino won the bronze medal match to complete the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After receiving her medal on the podium, Huang's boyfriend and fellow Chinese shuttler Liu Yuchen proposed to her in front of an ecstatic crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang made a commanding start with a strong attack to put them far ahead. Kim and Jeong tried their best to defend, but could not overcome the world number one duo in the first game 21-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans stepped up their efforts with more attacks in the beginning of the second game, knowing this would determine their position on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese side’s tactic to target one specific player at a time immediately put them back in the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair's powerful smash shots further widened the gap to end the game 21-11 and earn a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang lost to their Chinese counterparts at the Tokyo Olympics in the gold medal match, but this time around they were able to reach the top of the podium in just under an hour of game play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cap off her already special day, Huang's boyfriend Liu made a surprise appearance at the arena. He came prepared with an engagement ring, and presented it to Huang while on one knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will love you for my whole life. Will you marry me?" Liu asked in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overcome with joy, Huang said 'yes'.

    Row over Olympic boxing gender scandal deepens

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei in action with Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan.She is one of two athletes at the centre of a brewing controversy at the Olympics over gender. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764500_1_20240802224116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The double world champion from Chinese Taipei, Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the heart of a gender row, won her featherweight round of 16 bout against Uzbekistan's Sidora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision at the Paris Olympics on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, along with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won her round of 16 welterweight fight on Thursday against Italy's Angela Carini in 46 seconds, have been in the spotlight of the gender row after being cleared to compete in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women's events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing tournament in Paris, has cleared the boxers to compete in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IBA said in a statement the athletes "did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the "specifics" of this test "remain confidential", the IBA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the Olympic body's eligibility criteria was based on the gender indicated on the boxers' passports, but acknowledged that it's "not a black and white issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Lin nor Khelif is known to identify as transgender and both competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in the women's competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The row has expanded outside the ring, with politicians and celebrities weighing in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Khelif-Carini fight was "not on an equal footing", after the Italian fighter was left with a badly hurt nose and in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US presidential candidate Donald Trump declared on his Truth Social network that he would keep "men out of women's sports".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate JD Vance described Thursday's one-sided bout between Khelif-Carini as a "grown man pummelling a woman in a boxing match", adding: "This is disgusting, and all of our leaders should condemn it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Potter author JK Rowling said on X, formerly Twitter, that the Paris Games would be "forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday maintained a steady position in the pack after two more races in the men's dinghy event, with six still to come over the next three days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ranked 28th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 65 net points, compared with 32 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

 Carlos Alcaraz became the youngest man to reach the Olympic Games men's tennis final on Friday when he thrashed Felix Auger-Aliassime.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, 21, swept to a 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Canadian in just 75 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an objective since the start of the year to try and win the gold medal and now we have one match left to try and get it done," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to have fun in the final and do the business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish star, playing on the same Roland Garros court where he won the French Open in June, broke the 19th-ranked Auger-Aliassime three times in the first set, racing away with six consecutive games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz broke again in the fourth and sixth games of the second set on his way to claiming a fourth successive win over the Canadian having lost the first three of the pair's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very complete performance and I played at a very high level from start to finish," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had very good feelings and sensations, I'm so happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The final is very important for me and the Spanish people but I try not to think about how important it is and will focus on the match," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wimbledon champion Alcaraz is the third Spanish man to reach the Olympic men's final after Jordi Arrese at Barcelona in 1992, Sergi Bruguera in Atlanta four years later and Rafael Nadal who won gold at Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now has the chance to become the youngest men's champion since tennis returned to the Olympics at Seoul in 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz will face Novak Djokovic who reached his first Olympic final in what should be a dream showdown for gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top seed Djokovic, still seeking an elusive Olympic title to sit along his 24 Grand Slams, defeated Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2 in a nail-biting semi-final during which he was handed a code violation for swearing at the chair umpire. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said there were about 160,000 technology crime cases in the first half of the year, a 3.5 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said the total loss incurred in the cases amounted to HK$2.66 billion, and that they noted a surge in the use of blackmail apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Raymond Lam of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said tech crime in Hong Kong is on the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said though hacker groups are operating in the city, most cases involved overseas groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested that companies should be proactive when it comes to updating their devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of systems which the users do not update on time. If software and hardware are not updated on time, it will have a lot of loopholes. Therefore systems should be updated on time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Policy Office, meanwhile, said it checks government systems regularly, and it has not discovered loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Assistant Commissioner Daniel Cheung said they conduct spot checks, and any loopholes will be plugged immediately if any are found.

 Wang Zongyuan and Long Daoyi won the men's synchronised 3-metre springboard event at the Paris Olympics on Friday to claim the nation's fourth gold in diving.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both second-time Olympians, the pair finished on 446.10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, previously won gold in the same event in Tokyo three years ago with Xie Siyi, who is only competing in the individual event as defending champion in this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo trailed after the fourth of six dives, but they rallied on the final two dives to take China's fourth straight gold medal and stay on track for an unprecedented sweep of all eight diving events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long and Wang held off the Mexican team of Juan Celaya and Osmar Olvera with 444.03.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding of Britain took bronze with a score of 438.15. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Friday fought hard for the best rank he could get in the men’s single sculls at the Paris Olympic Games, despite dropping out of contention for a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu began in the second lane of the final group D race, where he was competing for the 19th to 24th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started off second in the first 500 metres, before pulling himself to the front of the pack in the next 1,000 metres. But Quentin Antognelli of Monaco came from behind to overtake Chiu in the end with a time of 6 minutes and 54.93 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we were unable to get a medal, I hope this serves as motivation and inspiration for younger rowers," Chiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want them to fight hard for their dreams and dream big, and we can have higher and faster results in future international events,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who finished second out of six in his race with a time of 6 minutes and 56.65 seconds, ranked 20th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He previously competed in the Rio Olympic Games, where he finished 19th in the lightweight double sculls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Table tennis powerhouse China on Friday secured places in both singles finals at the Paris Olympics, after Fan Zhendong made it through on the men's side while Chen Meng and  Sun Yingsha set up an all-China final in the women's competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, the second seed on the men's side, crushed local favourite Felix Lebrun 4-0 in a little more than half an hour in the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan won 11-8, 11-6, 11-7 and 11-5 to silence the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became China's only medal hopeful in the men's singles after top-seeded Wang Chuqin was stunned by Sweden's Truls Moregard in an earlier round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-seeded Lebrun, who's only 17, did manage a three-point lead in the third game, but was otherwise outclassed by Fan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will face Moregard in the final, after the Swede defeated Brazil's Hugo Calderano 4-2 in a gruelling semi-final matchup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chen has a chance to retain her Olympic singles title, after an emphatic 4-0 trouncing of South Korea's Shin Yubin in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Sun Yingsha, also from China, secured another all-China final after brushing aside Japan's Hina Hayata 4-0 in the other semi-final tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun won 11-6, 11-8, 11-8, 11-2, while not allowing the Japanese to take a lead in the last two games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed his six-day trip to Southeast Asia for allowing him to "meet new friends and strength past relationships", with a total of 55 non-binding deals signed with three countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "[We signed] twelve with Laos, 13 with Cambodia and 30 with Vietnam, covering a wide range of cooperative areas, such as trade and economic partnership, investment, customs collaboration, education, cultural exchanges and tourism promotion," he told reporters in Ho Chi Minh City on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have confirmed the support from the three countries' governments for Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an earlier luncheon with business leaders, Lee pledged to strengthen ties with Asean countries and reiterated his wish for Hong Kong to join the free trade pact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is making good use of the free trade agreement and investment agreement between Asean and Hong Kong to deepen our collaboration with Vietnam and other Asean countries. And we are eager to go beyond those free trade agreements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope, too, to join RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Through RCEP, I'm confident Hong Kong can make an even bigger contribution to the overall economic growth of Vietnam, Asean and the larger Asian region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Vietnamese politicians on his last day, including the chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Phan Van Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other visits included a trip to a Hong Kong-owned garment manufacturing factory, where the firm's chief executive officer was quoted as saying the company will continue to keep its headquarters in the SAR and attract talent from Asean countries to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR delegation was returning to Hong Kong on Friday evening.

<div class="itemFullText">
 It will be a guaranteed gold and silver for the national team as two Chinese pairs advanced to the final in the women’s doubles badminton event on Friday at La Chapelle Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first semi-final match, the pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan beat their Malaysian counterparts 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number one duo easily took the first game, 21-12, against Pearly Tan and Muralitharan Thinaah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Malaysians fought back 21-18 in the second, the first game the Chinese duo dropped in five matches throughout the tournament in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia then repeatedly targeted Tan, winning one point by directing multiple smashes at the Malaysian who managed a couple of acrobatic saves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese eventually prevailed and took the final game, 21-15, to book their place in the final. The two had won silver medals at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other match, Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning won in straight sets, after defeating Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida of Japan 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides fought aggressively in game one. The points were fairly equal until the national team pulled ahead to take it 21-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though the Japanese team managed to win a few points in the first half of the second game, the Chinese pair were able to widen the gap, ultimately winning 21-19.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Brands and Products Shopping Festival features more than 250 stalls and is expected to attract 60,000 visitors. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764428_1_20240802161229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day annual shopping festival kicked off on Friday at AsiaWorld-Expo, with organisers offering free admission to bargain hunters on opening day in celebration of Hong Kong's success at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, visitors and exhibitors at the Brands and Products Shopping Festival, organised by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, pointed to smaller crowds than usual at the fair that runs until August 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, featuring over 250 stalls, was expected to attract 60,000 visitors and generate some HK$60 million in sales revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ivan Sze, the association's vice-president, said he's not worried that sales would be affected by Hongkongers heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists being raised, we hope more mainland visitors will come to the festival to spend," Sze said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For Hongkongers heading north, dining accounts for a large proportion of their spending. But they may not buy too much across the border, because such consumption depends on the products themselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vendor surnamed Ng was selling sparkling wine at the fair and said there were several mainland tour groups visiting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were around 20 to 30 percent of visitors from the mainland. And with organisers offering free admissions, the number of people coming on the first day was about 20 to 30 percent more than last year's opening day," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would already be great for sales this year to match the previous year's levels... I hope the government can introduce more new promotional deals, or stimulate the retail sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor from the Netherlands, who gave his name as Hugo, said he did not see a lot of overseas visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy with the people who are there, but I hope there are more people in the weekend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Macau resident surnamed Lau came to Hong Kong just for the festival and spent around HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere was quite nice, and people were very friendly. The vendors were fair when doing business, and they were courteous," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tseung Kwan O resident surnamed Cheung said it took her two hours to travel from home to the event venue.

  "If I did not have a voucher [for the festival], I might not have come... It seemed to have few people here. It's only the first day and there were only a handful of people," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An advocacy group on Friday called for more government support for people raising children with special educational needs (SEN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People Service Centre said a survey it carried out involving the caregivers of 175 children with special educational needs found almost 65 percent would like to be able to work, while 80 percent said existing employment support on offer was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social worker Zoe Lam said mothers caring for such children can find their responsibilities overwhelming, while a lack of flexibility in the workplace prevents them from getting a job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “One of our SEN caregivers, she tried to find [childcare] services but she experienced being rejected a number of times because her son was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia,” said Lam
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to 10 percent of the survey respondents said they had been denied childcare services because of their child's emotional or behavioural condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advocacy group called for more family-friendly employment policies, employment subsidies, employer incentives and the improvement of SEN childcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want these four recommendations to be put in the 2024 Policy Address, because now caregivers do not have the choice to choose between personal development and taking care of their families," Lam said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ada Chung says people should be wary of sharing photos and videos of themselves too widely due to a rise in deepfake scams. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764388_1_20240802111958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers should avoid sharing photos or videos of themselves too widely to reduce the risk of scammers hijacking their images, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Chung said fraudsters are using technology to create deepfake images and videos to trick people into handing over money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong employees of two multinational companies have fallen victim to such scams this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If people really like sharing photos and videos of themselves, they should only share it with a specific audience group or privately. This will already make it much safer. They do not have to share it publicly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said her office received around 600 enquiries relating to fraud in the first six months of the year, up nearly 90 percent on the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said most involved phone scams, including cases where callers impersonated employees of various organisations to try to get people to give away personal information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencer Edgar Cheung returned to a hero's welcome from the Paris Games on Friday saying he still can't believe he managed to become the first athlete in decades to defend a men's foil title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who's also the first-ever SAR competitor to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals, was greeted by a crowd of fans as he arrived at the airport
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Never give up trying our best to give everything... because for me, it's what I train for, for the Olympics and every day I train hard to be in a good condition to fence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said his only regret from the Games was that the men’s foil team didn't qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said every SAR athlete gives their very best and they deserve respect regardless of whether they win a medal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he's going to have a big holiday before getting back to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We prepared for the Olympics for the past three years. It was hard, it was tough and physically, mentally, I'm quite tired. So for me now, I just want to have a good rest and to prepare for the next season,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having spent a lot of time in France, Cheung said he was craving Hong Kong cuisine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he had no plans yet on what to do with his HK$6 million prize money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on Italy's complaint and suggestions of bias over his victory against Filippo Macchi, Cheung said referees always follow fencing rules, even if they sometimes have different interpretations. He added that the referees in Paris were all professional and experienced.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index on Friday was down about 1.4 percent, or 240 points, in early trading at 17,064.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off came after Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday following weak manufacturing data, sparking worries about a US recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, European stocks had slumped on disappointing bank earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US indices finished decisively lower, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index falling the most at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets will get another key US economic data point on Friday with monthly jobs data. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For any Olympian, there's no shame in losing to the world's best player. There's even less shame when that player wasn't even born when you first competed at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But that's exactly the situation that 61-year-old table tennis player Ni Xialian found herself in in the women's singles in Paris. The Shanghai native, who represents her adopted country of Luxembourg, has been winning hearts as she proves that age is but a number ... even when it comes to playing a sport at the very highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni wrote herself into Olympic history as the oldest competitor to win a table tennis match when she beat Sibel Altinkaya of Turkey 4-2 in the round of 64 in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni, who won a mixed doubles world championship for China in her youth before moving to Europe, said she has already reached her goal of being able to compete at the Olympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Olympics has its own difficulties, but every time is exciting and a wonderful experience. For the technique part of the game, it depends on the draw," she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important. If you have some difficult draw, it's difficult. But of course, my age, you cannot against the nature. Every year getting more difficult, that's a fact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni's Olympic journey ended on Wednesday after being edged out by world number one Sun Yingsha of China, who is 38 years younger than her. Sun was born just a couple of months after Ni's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy to have this opportunity and not every day have such a chance, she's number one and people say I'm the only one, so I think it's a very happy, interesting game and we are showing Chinese table tennis [to] the world," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's such a strong, different generation and different area, and I hope I can offer a wonderful game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though Ni has completed her Olympic journey - at least until 2028 - she has won the hearts of many fans for her youthful spirit, becoming a social media hit after her inspiring performance at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people expressed their respect for her performance, while many others commented on the athlete's cuteness when she deployed spin to return her opponent’s shots.

 No medals for Hong Kong, China on Day 6 of the Olympic Games in Paris, although the SAR's athletes saw action in the pool and on the waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were more golds to celebrate for China in men's shooting and women's athletics, plus an historic result for Zheng Qinwen who beat the world number one to reach the women's Olympic tennis final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of the day, China top the medals table with 11 golds, with the US in second place. Hong Kong are now ranked 14th with two gold and two bronze medals.

 Kate Douglass underlined her remarkable versatility with gold in the women's 200 metres breaststroke at the Paris Olympics on Thursday, beating Tokyo champion Tatjana Smith who bows out of a stellar swimming career with a silver medal in her final race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking full advantage of her turning prowess, American Douglass nudged ahead of Smith after every length and held off the South African to touch the wall in 2:19.24 at La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really excited. I feel like for a while I wasn't sure if Olympic champion was going to be possible for me to say, and now it's just really exciting to see it happen," Douglas told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Tes Schouten won bronze for the Netherlands, her first Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's finals, Hubert Kos took Hungary's first swimming gold of the Paris Olympics when he won the men's 200 metres backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Apostolos Christou took the silver and Switzerland's Roman Mityukov the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia rounded out the evening with victory in the women's 4x200 metres relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holders didn't have it all their own way though, as they were pushed hard in the first three legs by the US and defending champions China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, world record holder Ariarne Titmus anchored the Aussies to an Olympic-record winning gold while the US took silver and China the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US silver meant also that Katie Ledecky became the most decorated female swimmer of all time with 13 Olympic medals. (Agencies)

    Wall Street ends down on jitters over manufacturing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street initially opened stronger, but changed direction after manufacturing data raised concerns about the economy. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764341_1_20240802042650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks kicked off August sharply lower after a round of economic data on Thursday spurred concerns the economy may be slowing faster than anticipated while the Federal Reserve maintains a restrictive monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities initially opened higher, partly lifted by Meta Platforms after its quarterly results topped expectations and the Facebook parent issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the early gains evaporated after data showed a measure of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) dropped to an eight-month low in July at 46.8, signifying contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What you’re seeing now, and you will probably see it for the next month or two, is some kind of consolidation and sideways price action," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bigger picture bull trend is intact ... But we're in a period now where the market is kind of digesting its gains sideways, back and forth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 lost 75.62 points, or 1.4 percent, to end at 5,446.68, the Nasdaq Composite lost 405.26 points, or 2 .3 percent, to 17,194.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 494.82 points, or 1.2 percent, to 40,347.97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  August is typically one of the weakest months of the year for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other data showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labour market, although seasonal factors also played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will eye government payroll data later on Friday for signs of further weakness in the labour market. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Yufei came up short in her title defence of the 200m butterfly, coming back third while relinquishing her Olympic record to eventual champion Summer McIntosh of Canada.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang, who earlier took bronze in the 100m butterfly, was in the chase at the halfway mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But McIntosh powered into a decisive lead by the final turn of the pool, while American Regan Smith also caught up with Zhang down the stretch to clinch silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh touched the wall after two minutes and 3.03 seconds, smashing the previous record set in Tokyo by more than eight-tenths of a second. Zhang came back over two seconds later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Jiangsu native has one more shot at gold in the 50m freestyle, which starts on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday evening, China added a bronze in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Junxuan and Li Bingjie, who were part of the quartet who struck gold in Tokyo, were joined by Ge Chutong and Liu Yaxin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finished at just over seven minutes and 42 seconds, around four seconds behind winners Australia, while the United States took silver.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong scraped through to the men's singles semi-final after a pulsating contest against Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who bagged silver in Tokyo, erased a two-game deficit before outlasting his opponent 4-3 in 68 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was a major relief for Chinese fans, after top seed Wang Chuqin suffered a shock exit in the round of 32 yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan's defeat would be a huge disappointment for China, as they have finished on the podium of the men's singles in every Games since 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I didn't perform particularly well today, and allowed my opponent to dictate the rhythm," Fan told RTHK after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to break through, and kept my confidence. Eventually I found a way while keeping the score close, and waited for the momentum to shift."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will next take on 17-year-old French prodigy Felix Lebrun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Sun Yingsha reached the last four in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed has not dropped a single game so far in Paris, going 16-0 following her latest victory over Chinese Taipei's Cheng I-ching in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, who already bagged a gold in the mixed doubles, will next face Hina Hayata of Japan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles clinched her sixth Olympic gold medal in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Paris Games on Thursday, reasserting her status as the number one all-around gymnast three years after she withdrew from the same final at the Tokyo Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight race between Biles and Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, the American was surprisingly left trailing in third place after a flawed performance on the uneven bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she was back on top after a solid performance on her next apparatus - the balance beam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she waited to perform last on the floor, she knew the gold would be hers if she avoided any unexpected slip ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She executed an electrifying routine to secure the gold with a total of 59.131 points, just 1.199 points ahead of her Brazilian rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrade earned a second successive silver in the competition where each gymnasts needs to show off their skills on all four women's apparatus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles' teammate Sunisa Lee, the Tokyo all-around champion, fought back from a disappointing start on the vault to claim thee bronze with 56.465 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles captured her second gold medal of the Paris Games, and her second all-around Olympic title after also winning the individual event in Rio in 2016. She also claimed the team gold earlier this week. (Reuters)

    UK central bank eases rates as inflation ebbs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Governor Andrew Bailey joined four other policymakers in bringing the rate down from a 16-year high.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate for the first time since the pandemic broke out in 2020, as British inflation has retreated in recent months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight 5-4 vote, BoE policymakers agreed to reduce borrowing costs by a quarter-point to 5.0 percent, the central bank announced following a regular meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Andrew Bailey joined four other policymakers in bringing the rate down from a 16-year high, which will ease pressure on borrowers while denting interest earned by savers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail banks tend to mirror the direction of BoE policy when setting their own interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inflationary pressures have eased enough that we've been able to cut interest rates," Bailey said in a short statement. "But we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's annual inflation rate has returned to the BoE target of two percent, after soaring to a four-decade high above 11 percent in late 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its key lending rate unchanged, but noted "some further progress" had been made in bringing inflation down. It is expected to cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the BoE's action Thursday, analysts said they expected the British central bank to cut again this year, but maybe not as early as next month. That helped the pound claw back earlier losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, the European Central Bank has started to trim rates as gains to prices of global goods and services have largely slowed in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday hiked borrowing costs for only the second time in 17 years amid a pickup in the country's inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's rate cut comes less than one month after the country elected a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour administration has vowed to grow the UK economy but has already warned that state spending will be hampered by tight finances. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese weather authorities said July was the country's hottest month since records began, state media said on Thursday, as extreme temperatures persist across large parts of the globe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last month was "the hottest July since complete observations began in 1961, and the hottest single month in the history of observation", state broadcaster CCTV said, citing weather authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average air temperature in China last month was 23.21 degrees Celsius (73.78 degrees Fahrenheit), exceeding the previous record of 23.17 C in 2017, CCTV reported the weather authorities as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mean temperature in every province was also "higher than the average for previous years", with the southwestern provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan logging their highest ever averages, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has experienced by extreme weather this summer, with heat waves scorching parts of the north while torrential rains have triggered floods and landslides in central and southern areas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma have both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng entered the day ranked ninth overall out of 24 men's entrants, having won a race yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two remaining races were scrapped, meaning the 24-year-old had no chance to make up lost ground. Only the top 10 surfers would reach the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma, on the other hand, fell two places to finish 14th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was disqualified on the first race on Thursday, and placed 15th and 10th in the ensuing two. Like the men's competition, the two final women's races were cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday has a lot of catching up to do after the opening day of dinghy competition in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Olympic debutante is placed 28th out of 43 after two races, with eight still to come over the coming four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner for each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday is now on 49 points, compared with 27 for Jean-Baptiste Bernaz of France in 10th place.

 Italy's Lorenzo Musetti knocked defending champion Alexander Zverev out of the Olympic Games tennis tournament on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Musetti triumphed 7-5, 7-5 over the German world number four in the quarter-finals and will face either top seed Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz of Spain stormed into the semi-finals with an imperious display of tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, playing on the same Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros where he captured the French Open in June, saw off 13th-ranked Tommy Paul of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz recovered from a break down in the second set to defeat Paul, having also beaten the American in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on his way to the title at the All England Club last month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan are expected to be released by Russia as part of one of the biggest East-West prisoner swaps since the Cold War, according to US media on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CNN and other US networks reported the news, with ABC News reporting that the swap involved numerous countries and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate confirmation from US officials. The Kremlin declined to comment on any exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still have no comment on this topic," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March 2023 and convicted in July on spying charges in a fast-track trial denounced as a sham by the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of an imminent prisoner swap had picked up momentum on Thursday, amid reports a plane used in a previous exchange deal had landed in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopes had also risen in recent days days after a number of high-profile prisoners in Russia, including Whelan, went missing from prisons where they were serving long terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those expected to be returned to Russia in exchange is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian citizen imprisoned in Germany for killing a former Chechen rebel commander in a brazen assassination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exchange would be a victory for US President Joe Biden, whose vice president, Kamala Harris, faces Republican Donald Trump in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would be the first prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since star US basketball player Brittney Griner was swapped in return for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen of China stunned women's world number one Iga Swiatek on Thursday to become the first player from the nation to reach an Olympic Games tennis singles final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventh-ranked Zheng triumphed 6-2, 7-5 and will face either Croatia's Donna Vekic or Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel more than just happy – happy isn't enough to describe how I feel," said Zheng, who had played back-to-back three-hour matches to make the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you ask me to play another three hours for my country, I would. It was an amazing match. To beat Iga is not easy, as it's an important event for her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion at Roland Garros, went into Thursday's match at a sweltering Court Philippe Chatrier on a 25-match win streak in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old had defeated Zheng in all of their six previous meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the mixed doubles, the Chinese pair of Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen reached the final after defeating their opponents from the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Zhang were slow off the block in the semi-final, conceding the opening set 2-6 to Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese pair levelled the match at one set apiece by winning set two 6-4, before clinching the tie-break 10-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will face the winner of the other semi-final between the pairs from Canada and the Czech Republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final is scheduled on Saturday morning, Hong Kong time at Roland Garros. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department on Thursday said it conducted around 6,900 checks at about 700 old residential and commercial buildings as of the end of last month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said inspections were stepped up after a fatal fire in a Jordan residential block in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Fire Officer Michael Yung said the common hazards identified during the inspections included defective smoke-stop doors and obstructed escape routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the department will take legal action against those who ignore warning notices and fail to carry out improvement works.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For these inspections, we have issued about [5,000] fire hazard abatement notices, and we will likely take legal action against 264 offences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung added the department aims to inspect 1,000 high-risk old buildings by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the department prosecuted over 1,000 cases for non-compliance to fire safety directions in the first half of the year, a threefold increase compared to the previous year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Hong Kong swimmers on Thursday failed to make it out of the heats at Paris La Defense Arena, bringing their Olympic journeys to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cindy Cheung, the youngest member to represent the SAR in swimming, competed in the women’s 200m backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old maintained a steady pace in her heat against two others, finishing in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She clocked 2 minutes 17.32 seconds, more than 4 seconds behind the winner Tatiana Salcutan of Moldova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who came 26th overall among 27 swimmers, said she was not happy with her performance but that her experience in Paris had been invaluable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the end, this was a very good learning experience. I got to see how the Olympic Village was like, and experienced what it was like to compete at such a high level – the feeling is very different," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though my finishing time was not up to my expectations, this was an experience that's hard to come by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men’s side, Ian Ho also concluded his second Olympics in the pool after he failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the men’s 50m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old came last in his heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really can’t complain. It’s been a good Olympics for me, and to have such a different experience from last time...Really, I’m grateful for what I’ve been able to do," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and Ho were eliminated from the women’s 100m backstroke and the men’s 100m freestyle earlier.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 9.7 percent to HK$29.9 billion in June, government data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, total retail sales were down 6.6 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman attributed the decline to changing consumer behaviour among both visitors and residents, as well as the strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said the rate of decline narrowed further in June, signalling a stabilisation in retail activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the spokesman pointed to ongoing challenges for the sector in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said central government initiatives benefiting Hong Kong and the SAR government's efforts to support the retail sector through mega-events would help retailers.

    Fraud alert system to cover bank transactions

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An alert that warns people using the Faster Payment System (FPS) they could be about to lose money to fraudsters is being extended to transactions made in banks or via online banking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From August 4, bank customers will receive an alert if they are on the verge of making a transfer to a recipient flagged as high-risk by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Chu, executive director in banking supervision at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said the extended alert system will offer people more protection from scammers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After this expansion, the coverage of bank transfer transactions will increase from 35 percent to 84 percent. It basically has a wide coverage of the fund transfer transactions, and it will enhance the protection to customers to send the high-risk alerts to them to warn them before they execute a transaction," Chu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Lam from the police's Cyber Security and Technology Bureau said the fraud alert system has been effective since its launch in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of the end of June this year, our system has issued more than 650,000 high-risk alerts. That is an average of one warning for every 30 seconds, which is effectively reminding people of the risk of a scam," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Projected from the average loss of about HK$1,500 per each scam case, and we anticipate the high-risk alert has so far issued a warning of scams [involving] nearly HK$1 billion."

 Liu Yukun emerged victorious in the men's 50m rifle three positions event on Thursday, to bag China's tenth gold at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has encouraged Hong Kong entrepreneurs to better integrate into national reform and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also called on them to contribute further to Chinese modernisation by giving full play to their strengths, in a letter to representatives of Hong Kong entrepreneurs with roots in Ningbo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, descendants of Ningbo-born Hong Kong entrepreneurs wrote to Xi to report on their efforts to support national development and express their commitment to the country's modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the reply letter, the president spoke highly of their tradition of patriotism and contributions to the development of their hometown and the country through active engagement in innovation and entrepreneurship and donations to education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Efforts to build a great country and move towards national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernisation requires the concerted efforts of all Chinese people, Xi added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee thanked President Xi for his response to the entrepreneurs, saying that Xi's letter encourages them to contribute to national development. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers from Chinese University on Thursday called for the implementation of a proactive screening and prevention strategy to tackle the serious pregnancy complication pre-eclampsia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pre-eclampsia, a condition that typically manifests after 20 weeks of pregnancy, is characterised by high blood pressure, elevated urine protein levels indicating kidney damage, and other signs of organ dysfunction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said pregnant women should be screened for pre-eclampsia, with those at risk given low-doses of aspirin as a preventative measure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said their recommendation follows a study conducted with partners across Asia which showed the effectiveness of such a preventative approach, with the practice already established in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the strategy can significantly cut the incidence of pre-eclampsia by between 41 and 54 percent, as well as reducing premature births and perinatal deaths by more than 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liona Poon, professor of obstetrics at the university, highlighted the critical nature of the condition, saying it poses a serious threat to both mother and baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the worst case scenario, the woman can present with seizures and this is what we are very worried about... It's a life-threatening condition for herself as well as her unborn child," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So why do we recommend early screening? It's because there is strong evidence suggesting that there is a way of preventing pre-eclampsia and that is giving high-risk women aspirin. Aspirin should be started before 16 weeks of gestation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university's study involved nearly 43,000 pregnant women in Hong Kong and nine other places in Asia.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said Vietnam's rapid economic growth offers lucrative business opportunities for Hong Kong enterprises.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee's comment came as Hong Kong signed eight memoranda of understanding with Vietnam, covering areas such as aviation development, investment and commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the day, the CE met Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Luu Quang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During their discussions, Lee said that Hong Kong serves as an ideal hub for Vietnam to expand its presence in overseas markets, being as it offers exceptional financial, legal and professional services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Tran said the talks focused on strengthening trade and cooperation between the two places, noting Hong Kong's substantial investments in Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the afternoon, Lee met Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Xiong Bo at the embassy in Hanoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xiong said the SAR has transitioned from stability to prosperity, under Lee's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ambassador also affirmed the central government's support for Hong Kong's Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) bid, as well as its participation in Sino-Asean cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE's visit to Vietnam is the final leg of a six-day trip in Southeast Asia.

    HK green group urges action on coral bleaching

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 WWF-Hong Kong on Thursday urged the government to designate 30 percent of the SAR's waters as marine protected areas by 2030.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call comes after the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department received reports of coral bleaching in Hong Kong waters last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bleaching strips coral of its main source of energy, and the coral's demise weakens the overall ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelvin So, WWF-Hong Kong's Oceans Conservation Manager, said the main cause of bleaching is a rise in water temperature. It can also be caused by heavy rainfall, which carries sediments from land that can degrade water quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So urged the government to collaborate with universities to study coral bleaching in Hong Kong's waters and to take step to better protect them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to identify and designate ecologically sensitive area for corals such as Sharp Island and Shelter Island in Sai Kung, and establish legally binding regulations to protect these critical areas from human activities," he said.

    New rules on feeding wild animals take effect

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ban on feeding wild animals now also covers feral pigeons. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764231_1_20240801132929.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law took effect on Thursday, with lawmakers urging the authorities to make sure tourists are aware of rules banning the feeding of wild animals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by Legco in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Offenders may be hit with a fixed penalty of HK$5,000, with the ban now also covering the feeding of feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers, district councillors and officials, including Undersecretary for Environment and Ecology Diane Wong and Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Mickey Lai, went to Tseung Kwan O on Thursday to publicise the new rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, DAB lawmaker Stanley Li said he is concerned that tourists will not be aware of the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because they may be permitted to feed feral pigeons in the countries or places they come from. But this is banned in Hong Kong. As I mentioned in the bills committee, the government needs to enhance promotion and place clear signs at border points,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also noted that appointed officers from certain government departments, and not just the police and Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), can now enforce the law even in private venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the authorities to provide training to these departments to avoid disputes or confusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sai Kung district councillor Angel Chong said she believes the new measures have a deterrent effect and will effectively reduce the number of pigeons in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The feeding of pigeons caused a lot of environmental issues back here and a lot of people actually fed them back then, but then we couldn't prosecute them,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But now feeding wild animals and especially pigeons is illegal. I think that actually reduces the incentive of feeding pigeons a lot because now they'd be afraid of being fined. So I think the environmental and health issues caused by feeding pigeons will improve.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD said that for a month, verbal warnings will be given before enforcement action, to allow people to adapt to the new rules.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will actively expand domestic demand and put consumption promotion at a more prominent position in the next step, Yuan Da, a senior official with the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The state planner will launch efforts to boost consumption of major commodities such as automobiles and home appliances, and to improve and expand the quality and capacity of service consumption in education, elderly care, child care and domestic services, Yuan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support will be given to the high-quality development of cultural and sports tourism, Yuan said, adding that measures will be optimised to make travel in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also expressed confidence that China will achieve its full-year economic growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "sufficient" room for counter-cyclical policy adjustments, said Zhao Chenxin, vice head of the state planner. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday kept its base rate at 5.75 percent, after the US Federal Reserve ended a two-day meeting leaving its key rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the first interest rate cut could come as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said “inflation pressure in the US has somewhat abated lately, and the market expects that the easing cycle might begin soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it added that the pace of any easing remains uncertain, and said the interbank offered rate in Hong Kong might stay high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong made a triumphant return to Hong Kong on Thursday, days after winning the SAR's first gold of the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made a sensational comeback in the women's epee gold medal match, overcoming a deficit of 1-7 at one point to beat French rival Auriane Mallo-Breton 13-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she was moved by the show of support from the many fans who gathered for her arrival at Hong Kong airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong's home. It's so good to be home. And being in Paris, I love the French people, with my French friend in the finals. But they had a huge crowd supporting her, and coming back it feels like I have my crowd too,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she had missed her father and wanted to meet up with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about her future plans, she said she was still savouring her victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It still feels unreal. It still feels like I have to go train, but I don't have to today, so I think I'm going to try and let this sink in and then decide what's next.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong also paid tribute to SAR athletes of previous generations, saying they achieved remarkable results with far fewer resources, paving the way for the current crop to pursue their dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she plans to use some of her HK$6 million prize money to buy gifts for her team and coach, adding that she would like to set up a fund to help provide fencing equipment for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said her aim is not only to promote fencing, but also to inspire others to discover and pursue their own passions in athletics.

 The Hospital Authority (HA) called for community support for breastfeeding mothers as World Breastfeeding Awareness Week began on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leung Wing-cheong, a consultant obstetrician at Kwong Wah Hospital, said the authority has introduced various initiatives to promote breastfeeding, including lactation consultant clinics to address the concerns of mothers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said additional support includes antenatal education programmes and a dedicated helpline to assist women with breastfeeding challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that an important step forward will be the establishment of a breast milk bank, which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of next year. The bank is expected to collect 1,000 litres of breast milk per year, benefiting up to 600 premature babies, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said that breast milk is the most natural food for babies, highlighting the long-term benefits of breastfeeding in reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems in babies, as well as promoting neurological development in infants. He added that it also helps recovery after pregnancy and reduces the risk of breast cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that successful breastfeeding is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will be ideal if they have enough support from their partner, husband, in-laws, parents etc. I think successful breastfeeding is indeed teamwork, not just the mother on her own," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday rejected accusations in a Forbes Magazine article that suggested that Hong Kong was being used as a hub by "rogue regimes" to conduct "illicit financial transactions and evade international sanctions."
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government hit out at the Forbes commentary, claiming it cited "false and unfounded narratives" from an anti-China group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the SAR is part of China and that UN Security Council sanctions had always been imposed in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without naming names, it said certain countries might impose unilateral sanctions against some places on the basis of their own considerations but that the SAR government did not have the legal authority to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said thanks to local law enforcement agencies, a number of suspected Hong Kong-registered companies had been struck off, and suspicious vessels had been denied entry into Hong Kong waters as part of its robust system to implement sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cedric Ho recalls having doubts about his career. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764124_2_20240731231321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencers Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho said they're aiming higher after making their Olympic debuts in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both hope to continue to shine in the sport thanks to the spirit of never giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan bowed out of the women’s foil individual event after she was beaten by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16. Still, it's the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old recalled enjoying every moment on the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I was just focusing on the skills or tactics, what I want to do and just try my very best to score. And even though I know at the very end the gap was quite big, I didn't give up. Actually in my mind, I just want to try all my stuff and I just want to do my best," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said fellow fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung’s triumphs motivated her and other young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was amazing because my competition day was in the middle. So like before my competition day I saw Vivian got the gold medal… They brought home two gold medals which is never easy, and I think a lot of citizens will know fencing this sport and I think more and more kids will be joining this sport as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a part-time fencer who’s studying in the United States, Chan said it was difficult to juggle between fencing and her studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she made it clear she didn’t want to give up the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho, meanwhile, recalled being at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The idea of giving up came up most when I was at my lowest point, which was about two or three years after the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. I was a bit down and confused and kind of wanted to give up, but luckily I got through in the end,” the 28-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho is the first male épéeist from the SAR to qualify for the Olympics in 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to Japan's Masaru Yamada in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This proves that we have worked very hard in the men's épée category for the past 12 years. The success of our men's épée is due to the whole team and the coaches working together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said he's proud of Ho’s performance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel that he has a lot of takeaways. He's seen his potential, his strengths, and he also has seen his room for improvement. And I hope that we can keep on growing together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu added he's confident that fencing will continue to develop in Hong Kong because of government support and infrastructure being put in place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index fell 16.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to open at 17,327.85 points on Thursday, following its 2 percent rise on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates could be cut as soon as September if the US economy follows its expected path, putting the central bank near the end of a more than two-year battle against inflation. The Fed ended its latest two-day policy meeting with a decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25-5.50 percent range that was set a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it was keeping its base rate at 5.75 percent.
