<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day mixed on Monday, as another Federal Reserve policymaker came out in favour of starting interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is "hard to imagine" not cutting interest rates in September, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Monday, a few days after Fed chair Jerome Powell said the time had come to start adjusting monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The direction of change is down, and the time to adjust is now," Daly said, signalling her support for a rate cut at the Fed's rate meeting next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 41,240.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent to 5,616, while the Nasdaq lost 0.9 percent, closing at 17,725.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think people used today as an opportunity to take some near-term profits," said Sam Stovall, from CFRA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech stocks slipped, with Nvidia finishing the day down 2.3 percent ahead of quarterly earnings results on Wednesday. Broadcom slipped more than four percent. (AFP)

    UN says movement of aid, aid workers in Gaza halted

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Israeli military has told people in Deir al-Balah to evacuate immediately. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767753_1_20240827033817.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations said on Monday it had to halt the movement of aid and aid workers within Gaza due to a new Israeli evacuation order for the Deir al-Balah area, which had become a hub for its workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A senior UN official had earlier said that UN operations had stopped completely within the Strip, but officials later clarified that operations "in situ" and "embedded" with local populations would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the official, the UN had relocated most of its personnel in operations to Deir al-Balah following a Rafah evacuation order several months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said on Monday it was targeting "terror operatives" in Deir al-Balah and working to dismantle the remaining "infrastructure" of Hamas, whose October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has told people to evacuate immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the UN humanitarian agency (Ocha), 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers and four UN warehouses were affected, being either in or near the area ordered to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After it appeared that the UN had shut down its Gaza operations, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, clarified that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees was continuing operations, although under restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What our senior UN official was referring to is UN officials and UN humanitarian staff moving about," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If humanitarian workers are embedded with a certain population in a certain area, they have the tools to operate and to share and to distribute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They will do so," he added, though warning that it would be "half a drop in a barrel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam Rose, senior deputy field director for Unrwa in Gaza, added that "health services continue across eight or nine primary healthcare centres and over 90 health points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But indeed, the space and the ability of the UN system, of the humanitarian system to operate in Gaza is becoming increasingly difficult," Rose added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Sox catcher Danny Jansen became the first player in major league history to appear in the same game for both teams when he took the field for Boston on Monday in the resumption of a rain-delayed game he started for Toronto in June.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jansen was in the Blue Jays' lineup at catcher and batting in the second inning on June 26 when the game was suspended. He was traded to the Red Sox last month, and on Monday he took his position behind the plate as pinch-hitter Daulton Varsho struck out to complete the at-bat that Jansen started.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An authenticator was on hand to tag all of Jansen’s equipment, and the Baseball Hall of Fame said it requested the scorecard from official scorer Bob Ellis. Ellis was also working the game when it started in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This scorecard will be a great tool to document and illustrate this history, showing Danny Jansen’s name on both teams,” Hall spokesman John Shestakofsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the ballpark opened to fans, the scoreboards were showing Jansen at bat for the Blue Jays – complete with a picture of him in his Toronto cap. Before the first pitch, the umpires held an extended conversation at home with the coaches who brought out some of the weirdest lineup cards in baseball history. (AP)

    Paris metro 'impossible' for disabled, admits boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Paris metro comprises more than 300 stations, but only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767747_1_20240827012015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Paris regional transport network admitted on Monday that the city's metro system is near-impossible for disabled people to navigate as the French capital prepares to host the Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Games start on Wednesday, with a lack of accessible metro transport for disabled visitors a major gripe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first Paris metro opened in 1900 and the network has grown into the busiest system in the European Union, with more than 300 stations spread over 16 lines carrying over four million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's historic metro lines "remain the weak spot" in terms of accessibility, said Valerie Pecresse, who as president of the Paris region also runs its transport network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called for a massive effort to fix the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While all buses running in central Paris can take wheelchairs, only 25 percent of rail services – metros, trams and the RER suburban mass transit system – were accessible, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the metro could be modernised in terms of accessibility, she told reporters, although it would take 20 years and cost between 15 and 20 billion euros (US$16.7 to 22.3 billion) in investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an effort "could become the great project of this decade", she said, dubbing the idea "A Metro for All."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris's preparations for the Paralympics, which run to September 8, has highlighted the lack of accessible transportation in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Pecresse said some solutions had been put in place for the Games, including around 100 minibuses to take disabled visitors to competition venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There would also be a smartphone app to help them prepare their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities expect up to 300,000 daily visitors during the Paralympics, about half that of the Olympics. (AFP)

    Israel strikes Gaza after Lebanon flare-up

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military struck the Gaza Strip on Monday a day after truce talks in Cairo coincided with a major but brief cross-border escalation involving Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has drawn in Tehran-aligned armed groups across the Middle East, repeatedly heightening fears of a broader regional conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest flare-up between Israel and Hamas-ally Hezbollah, the Lebanese group on Sunday launched rockets and drones in retaliation for a top commander's killing as Israel carried out air raids the military said thwarted a larger attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel swiftly revoked a state of emergency declared early on Sunday, and Hezbollah said its operation was "completed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intense diplomacy has sought to head off a broader retaliation for the late July killings of senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike on Beirut, and of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators held meetings in the Egyptian capital on Sunday but reported no breakthrough in months of protracted negotiations to end the Gaza war as the fighting raged on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key sticking point has been Israel's insistence that it keep control of several strategic areas, including the so-called Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, to stop Hamas from re-arming, something the militant group has refused to countenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cairo, which has been mediating the talks alongside Qatar and the United States, made clear on Monday it would not support continued Israeli control of the corridor, according to state-linked media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt "reiterated to all parties that it will not accept any Israeli presence" along the corridor, Al-Qahera news reported, citing a high-level source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground, witnesses reported air strikes and shelling in Gaza City and other parts of the besieged Palestinian territory overnight and Israel's military said it had struck militants in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medics said an air strike on a Gaza City house killed at least five people, with two rescuers saying more victims may be buried in the ruins in Al-Rimal neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still martyrs and body parts under the rubble," ambulance driver Hussein Muhaysen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli military statement said troops had "eliminated" dozens of militants over the past day in the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, and near Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,435 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not break down civilian and militant deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants in their attack, 105 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces throughout the war, in what the group says is support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After weeks of retaliation threats, Hezbollah early on Sunday launched what it said was part of its response to Shukr's killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking hours after Hezbollah announced its attacks on Israel with hundreds of rockets and drones, the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah said the "main target" was an intelligence base outside Tel Aviv, more than 100 kilometres from the Lebanese border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said there were "no hits" on the Glilot intelligence complex, which according to Israeli media is home to the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli air strikes at the same time hit more than 270 targets in Lebanon, "90 percent" of which were rockets "aimed at northern Israel," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet the strikes were "not the final word" in the campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah appeared to suggest Hezbollah's retaliation for Shukr's killing might be over, saying "if the result is satisfactory" then its response "has been accomplished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Foreign Minister Nasser Kanani praised the Hezbollah attack, saying the "strategic balance has undergone fundamental changes" to the detriment of Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas official said that a delegation from the group met mediators in Egypt's capital on Sunday. Israeli negotiators were also scheduled to go to Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks have been based on a framework laid out in late May by US President Joe Biden and a "bridging proposal" Washington put forth earlier this month with support from Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10 months of war have left large parts of Gaza in ruins, ravaged its healthcare system and sparked a dire humanitarian crisis and warnings of famine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A batch of polio vaccines entered Gaza on Sunday, Israeli authorities said. UN agencies have planned a mass inoculation drive after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successive Israeli evacuation orders have forced many Gazans, most of whom have already been displaced at least once by the war, to move again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Sunday from her hospital bed outside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, Tamam al-Raei said she did not know where to seek safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a war injury. I have broken bones and have had an amputation, and I have been receiving treatment for that," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now they're telling us to evacuate Al-Aqsa. Where do we go? Where do I get treatment?" (AFP)

 Commerce minister Algernon Yau has pledged to make Hong Kong a multinational supply chain management centre to attract more mainland firms to set up shop in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony on Monday, the secretary for commerce and economic development said his bureau was coordinating with relevant authorities to provide one-stop services for companies to come to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To facilitate the country's accelerated development of new quality productive forces, the SAR government is committed to building Hong Kong into a multinational supply chain management centre, attracting more mainland manufacturers to set up here, managing their offshore trade headquarters, providing comprehensive and complete professional services, and assisting firms to upgrade their supply chain and expanding overseas business," he said.

    Ex-England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson dead at 76

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swedish football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who coached England from 2001 to 2006, died on Monday at the age of 76 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his agent said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "He passed away peacefully this morning with his family around him at his home," Eriksson's agent Bo Gustavsson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swede, who managed a number of high-profile teams and took England to World Cup quarter-finals in 2002 and 2006, announced in February 2023 that he was stepping back from public life due to "health issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, he told public broadcaster Sveriges Radio that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer and that his doctor's assessment was that he had "at best maybe a year (to live), at worst a little less."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have known about this but it happened very quickly. We were not prepared for it to happen today," said Gustavsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born February 5, 1948 in Sunne in western Sweden, Eriksson, who goes by "Svennis" to Swedes, found success as a football manager after retiring from a modest career as a defender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1977, he became manager of Swedish club Degerfors IF. After leading the small club to success in lower divisions, he attracted the attention of bigger clubs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to manage Sweden's IFK Goteborg before finding success internationally, managing Benfica in Portugal, as well as several Italian teams including Roma and Lazio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most high-profile position was as the first foreigner to manage England's national squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his spell, he took England to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002, where they were knocked out by Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also made the last eight four years later where Portugal came out on top in a penalty shoot-out in a game where Wayne Rooney was sent off after a clash with his then Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson led England to the last eight of the 2004 Euros where Portugal again knocked them out in another penalty shoot-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left the England job in 2006 after five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His time in the hotseat had seen a memorable 5-1 win over Germany in a World Cup qualifier but also controversy over his personal life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson then went on to manage Mexico, Ivory Coast and the Philippines, but never his native Sweden's national squad. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political heavyweights attending a seminar promoting the spirit of the third plenum on Monday said the session highlighted Hong Kong's role in national development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two senior Beijing officials, Shen Chunyao and Wang Wentao, held a seminar on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of China's Communist Party, which wrapped up in Beijing last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plenum adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, told reporters after the seminar that the SAR can contribute in a lot of ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two VIPs do suggest a lot of Hong Kong strengths, and the CE does suggest that we have to incorporate in our daily life. I totally agree with them, and we have to [take] action and we have to use Hong Kong's ability to contribute to the future of our country," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Executive councillor and lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said Hong Kong has to work harder to lure global talent and enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the near future and also in the distant future, we have to attract more companies to come and settle in Hong Kong and also talent to come to Hong Kong to help us progress. Hong Kong can go from strength to strength," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not have to worry too much about the fake news that is demonstrated by the liars everywhere around the world. We have to make sure that we do what is right for the country and for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yuk-shan, deputy director of the Basic Law Committee, said the session clearly spelled out the timeline for deepening reforms and the country's future plans.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Monday highlighted the key roles of Hong Kong and its contribution to the country, while also stressing that China's development offers the strongest support for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China's Communist Party earlier wrapped up the third plenary session of its 20th Central Committee, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a seminar held in Hong Kong on promoting the spirit of the plenum, Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress, said the country must rely on reform and opening up to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through reform and opening up, we have to promote the modernisation with Chinese characteristics... Reform and opening up have been crucial to the course of the party and the people, enabling us to catch up with the times in great strides," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shen, who also chairs the legislative affairs commission of the country's top legislature, pointed to a particular role for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles, given their respective strengths as 'super-connectors'. Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles in telling China's story well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the resolution, Beijing stated its support for Hong Kong's bid in becoming an "international hub for high-end talent" and consolidating its status as an international finance, maritime and trading centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said as a separate customs territory and a free port, the SAR serves as an important bridge for trade and investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also said Hong Kong should expand its talent pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong has long been nurturing talent from different parts of the world, and has a great business environment and a highly internationalised market. The education system and city life are very attractive. These are Hong Kong's strengths in pooling talent from far and wide,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister also said the One Country, Two Systems principle is "the biggest advantage" Hong Kong has.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When it comes to support, our country's development is the biggest support that Hong Kong can get," Wang said. "I personally think that national strength and capacity is the biggest support for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, said the top-level meeting showed the central government's high hopes for the SAR, and that the city should stay determined and find new ways to contribute to the country's reform and opening up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is extensive discussion of reform measures about Hong Kong. This shows the solicitude and high expectations of the central government. This is a strategic fulcrum for Hong Kong to shine. This also means new opportunities for Hong Kong to go from stability to prosperity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, said Hong Kong has played a key role in the country's reform and opening up and the SAR must be more proactive in integrating into the development of the nation.

    5 more arrested for alleged corruption and bid rigging

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ICAC and the Competition Commission conducted a joint operation last week, to crack down on what they say was a syndicate engaging in corruption and bid rigging.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five more people were arrested for alleged corruption and bid rigging in an operation that has seen more than 20 people investigated since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alleged mastermind and core syndicate members of the same syndicate were among 20 arrested in the first joint-operation between the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Competition Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two statutory bodies revealed on Monday they carried out a second joint-operation last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the five were suspected of engaging in acts which corrupted the renovation projects of two Hong Kong Island housing estates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The key members of the syndicate allegedly offered advantages to members of the Owners' Corporation through middlemen, so as to ensure the two syndicate-controlled companies would be awarded the contracts worth HK$140 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work on the projects had yet to begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Competition Commission also found the arrestees were allegedly involved in tender-rigging for contracts on 38 residential estates and industrial buildings amounting to over HK$1 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The highest amount involved a contract worth HK$260 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Au, head of investigations of the Competition Commission, said their investigation found that when renovation contracts were opened for tender, staff of the company concerned were alleged to have directly, or through middlemen, exchanged and coordinated the bidding price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the project contractors, meanwhile, carried out cover bidding, such as through using a higher bidding price to cover for others, until they have controlled the bidding results, and helped the designated bidder to win the tender," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers seized several computers, mobile phones, as well as related documents after searching around 20 premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not rule out more arrests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said its military was carrying out armed patrols near the Myanmar border this week, with Beijing concerned about the potential fallout from a civil war on the other side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Troops were deployed to Yunnan Province on Monday to test their ability to maintain security in border areas, the military’s Southern Theatre Command said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An alliance of ethnic militias has dealt a series of setbacks to Myanmar's military in the country's northeast, which is near China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five people were injured on the Chinese side in January by a stray artillery shell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live-fire drills would be held from Tuesday to Thursday in four locations including two in Ruili city, the Yunnan government said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The units will carry out armed patrols and joint air-ground patrols to test their ability to mobilise quickly, block and control and strike together, the southern command said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military previously held live-fire drills near the Myanmar border in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier this month that China “opposes chaos and war in Myanmar," according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing helped broker a cease-fire in Myanmar back in January, but that fell apart in June when one member of the Three Brotherhood Alliance launched new attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar issued a reminder this month to citizens in Shan State to strengthen their security precautions and stay away from conflict zones or return to China. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistani officials on Monday said at least 23 people were killed in a militant attack on a highway in southwestern Pakistan which targeted vehicles from buses to goods trucks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Armed men blocked the route in the province of Balochistan on Sunday night, took passengers off the vehicles, and shot them after checking their identity cards, a senior superintendent of police, Ayub Achakzai, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The armed men also not only killed passengers but also killed the drivers of trucks carrying coal," said Hameed Zahir, the deputy commissioner of the area where the incident occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 trucks were set on fire after their drivers had been killed, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants fighting a decades-old ethnic insurgency to demand the secession of resource-rich Balochistan from Pakistan have targeted workers from the eastern province of Punjab whom they see as exploiting their resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Balochistan Liberation Army group said its fighters had targeted military personnel travelling in civilian clothes, who were shot after being identified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's interior ministry said the dead were innocent citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack in a statement, vowing that security forces would retaliate and bring those responsible to justice. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should learn from and embrace the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and integrate it into daily life, Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 500 government officials, Executive Council members and lawmakers on Monday morning attended a seminar held at the government headquarters promoting the spirit of the plenum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks were led by Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress and chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who's also the Secretary of the CPC leadership group of the Ministry of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third plenum, which wrapped up last month in Beijing, adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the seminar, Lee said studying the spirit of the third plenum was beneficial to the SAR's long-term development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand its importance and significance for Hong Kong's future development, seize the opportunities, and further leverage Hong Kong's advantages of being highly internationalised, market-oriented, and rule of law-based under the 'One Country, Two Systems' system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong plays an irreplaceable role in the country's further reform and opening up. As a super connector and super value-adder, Hong Kong continues to play an important role as a bridge and window connecting the mainland and the world in going global and bringing in [enterprises]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about measures to attract high-end talent from around the world, Lee said the SAR government had introduced a series of programmes to bring in graduates from top universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said there were 340,000 applications for the Top Talent Pass Scheme so far, of which 210,000 had been approved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of Macau's Court of Final Appeal, Sam Hou-fai, has resigned from his position.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 62-year-old revealed last week he was considering to run for chief executive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng announced on Monday that Sam would leave his roles as president and judge of the city's top court, as well as a member of the Independent Commission on the Recommendation of Judges starting Wednesday, as per Sam's request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said last Wednesday he would not seek a second term as CE due to health reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nomination period for chief executive candidates will start on Thursday, and the enclave will elect its new leader on October 13.

    'Revenue not the only consideration for land sales'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development chief Bernadette Linn says financial proceeds are just one of the factors the government considers when it comes to the pace of land sales, saying market sentiment and the effect on prices of putting a plot up for sale are also important.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amid a sluggish property market, the government has eight plots in its land sale programme in the current financial year. One plot in Sha Tin was put up for sale in the last quarter, and another in the same area in the quarter before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said if a plot goes unsold or the bids received are far lower than market estimates, it can hurt property prices in the relevant district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials therefore need to assess the sentiments of the market and developers when making decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the land sale programme can serve as an adjustment tool and if there is sufficient private land, then the government doesn't need to roll out as much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary noted that in the past three financial years, not all sites in the programme were made available for bidding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also described the economy as being at a turning point right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many people have expectations about the US cutting interest rates later. Will Hong Kong follow? Everyone can see the market sentiments, like in the past half a year, there has been economic growth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But everyone is taking the wait and see approach - whether the growth is sustainable. Investors are taking that approach, and so are developers who bid for land."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also shot down the idea of returning to the system before 2013, when land sales were triggered by developers' applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government needs to have control over land provision and stability, saying the public could get very pessimistic about the market if developers are conservative and don't make applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the current financial year, the government has yet to put up any commercial plots for sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said if office vacancy rates in the upcoming quarters remain similar to current levels, there's a chance the government will continue to defer rolling out plots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said there are currently plenty of commercial buildings under construction, and so supply is not a problem.

 The Hang Seng Index climbed 97.17 points, or 0.55 percent to open at 17,709.27 points on Monday.

  <br/>
  This week traders in the US and around the globe are awaiting earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia, whose blistering run has powered markets throughout 2024.

  The S&P 500 has pared a sharp drop it suffered after US economic worries contributed to a sell-off at the beginning of the month and it again stands near a fresh all-time high.

    Australia gives workers the right to disconnect

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia gave millions of workers the legal right to "disconnect" on Monday, allowing them to ignore unreasonable out-of-hours contact from employers, to the distress of big industry.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People can now "refuse to monitor, read, or respond to" their employers' attempts to contact them outside work hours -- unless that refusal is deemed "unreasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law is similar to legislation in some European and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unions welcomed the legislation, saying it gave workers a way to reclaim a level of work-life balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a historic day for working people," said Michele O'Neil, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The union movement has won the legal right for Australians to spend quality time with their loved ones without the stress of being forced to constantly answer unreasonable work calls and emails," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australian unions have reclaimed the right to knock off after work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the reforms got a cool welcome from Australian industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'right to disconnect' laws are rushed, poorly thought out and deeply confusing," the Australian Industry Group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the very least, employers and employees will now be uncertain about whether they can take or make a call out of hours to offer an extra shift," said the country's peak industry group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law, enacted in February, came into force for medium-sized and large companies as of Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smaller companies with fewer than 15 employees will be covered from August 26, 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We encourage workplace participants to educate themselves on the right to disconnect and take a common sense approach to applying it within their workplace," said the head of Australia's workplace relations regulator, Fair Work Ombudsman Anna Booth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the law, workers may be ordered by a tribunal to stop unreasonably refusing out-of-hours contact, and employers likewise may be ordered to stop unreasonably requiring employees to respond, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The question of what is reasonable will "depend on the circumstances", the Fair Work Ombudsman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deciding factors may include the reason for the contact, the nature of the employee's role, and their compensation for working extra hours or being available, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France introduced the right to disconnect in 2017, hoping to tackle the "always on" culture facilitated by smartphones and other digital devices. (AFP)

    CUHK unveils novel remote endoscopy surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The research team in Zurich demonstrates how to use a joystick to remotely control an endoscope in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A surgeon in Zurich has performed the world’s first remote endoscopy procedure on a pig in Hong Kong, as researchers believe it paves the path for better and immediate surgical care in remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure was conducted in May as part of a joint-study between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) which started two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinician in Switzerland controlled a surgical controller that was remotely connected across 9,300 kilometres to an endoscope in the operating theatre in Hong Kong, CUHK said, noting that the endoscope matched every movement the clinician made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design was to use multiple small magnets to build our endoscope and use a magnetic field to control the direction, forward, backward, turn left, turn right, to control the angulation of the endoscope to perform an endoscopy," says Dr Shannon Chan from CUHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the surgeon in Switzerland would use the controller to control the magnetic field in Hong Kong and thus, with that, he could control the endoscope.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chan said the technology could be a game-changer for remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For places where they are lacking in experts, for example, in gastrointestinal disease, then the experts in their hometown can control and perform the endoscope for patients… so the experts can diagnose and treat patients from afar,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are hoping that with this technology... we are able to train doctors in resource-limited areas to perform some procedures remotely instead of having to fly over to their country to teach them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dr Chan noted a key prerequisite would be a stable Wi-Fi network in those areas, saying that would take a few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it's too early to compare the success rate of remote surgery with conventional procedure, saying the research team's next step is to prove the procedure is safe on human patients.

    Police mentorship program to attract aspiring officers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have called on people who want to join the force to enrol in their mentorship programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior inspector Jaffy Chan, overseeing recruitment, said the mentorship initiative would help candidates when applying to join the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said figures showed that one in five programme participants would successfully secure the position of Probationary Inspector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This success rate surpasses that of non-participants, where only one out of every 27 people succeeded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan explained that those who join the mentorship programme would gain hands-on experience and personal coaching from police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The very intentions of the rolling out of the programme is to allow mentees to have a diverse experience in getting to know what the police does, and how it's like to be a police officer should they join in the future," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, for this programme, every mentee is assigned with a mentor who will give them personal experience and coaching and workshop for their preparations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, 228 people joined the police mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them was 24-year-old Luce Lo, who took a two-month hiatus from her full-time job as a financial adviser for the mentorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said she was motivated to join the Police Force after the mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My determination is far more than before I have joined this internship, because through
  <br/>
  the daily interactions with the police inspectors or those colleagues, I see some qualities and also their professionalism being a police [officer]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applications for next year's mentorship programme will open on September 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lydia Ko said she had enjoyed a "Cinderella" story after ending an eight-year wait for a major title by winning the Women's British Open at St. Andrews on Sunday, just a fortnight after her Olympic gold medal triumph in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New Zealander finished in champion style with a superb birdie on the 18th hole of a windswept Old Course to complete a round of three-under-par 69 and claim her third major title with a tournament total of seven under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is surreal," Ko said. "Winning the gold medal in Paris a few weeks ago was almost too good to be true. Heading into the weekend I thought 'how is it possible for me to win the Open?'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko entered the final day three shots back of third-round leader Jiyai Shin, a two-time Women's Open champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shin was one of four women tied for second, with China's Ruoning Yin, Nelly Korda and Lilia Vu – each of them former major winners who have been ranked No. 1 in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is almost too good to be true," she added. "Out of all the major championships, this was the one I had the least amount of confidence in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory gave Ko, 27, her first major since she won the 2016 Chevron Championship. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) says its HA Go app has reduced waiting times at specialist out-patient clinics with the vast majority of patients being able to leave within two hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We want to keep the patients and not make them stay in our specialist clinics for more than two hours, which was not optimum in the past, but now more than 80 percent of them can achieve this target," said Larry Lee, the Hospital Authority's manager of cluster performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launched in 2019, the app's functions include appointment booking and queue monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the HA would continue to expand the app's functions, such as in the areas of telehealth and outreach services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority says the app has been downloaded over 3.3 million times and its user base has grown to more than 2.6 million.

 Adam Yates secured a sensational stage nine victory in the Vuelta a Espana on Sunday to revive his general classification hopes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British UAE Team Emirates rider went solo 58 kilometres from the finish in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He crossed the line one minute 39 seconds ahead of Richard Carapaz, who also put himself back in contention with a superb ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never suffered like this before, it's so hot out there," said Yates. "From the last climb I was cramping and I didn't know if I could go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had a lot of bad luck in Grand Tours over the years and I really didn't know if I could make it," he added. "But I'm just so happy I could finally win another Grand Tour stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor retained the red jersey and increased his lead on second placed Primoz Roglic to three minutes 53 seconds by claiming four bonus seconds as he finished third on the 178.5km run from Motril to Granada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every second counts, and I didn't lose time today – to some guys, yes – but in the end I showed my real capacity and what I can do, so I'm proud." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish champions Real Madrid earned a 3-0 win over Real Valladolid in La Liga on Sunday as Kylian Mbappé made his Santiago Bernabeu bow without finding the net.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atletico Madrid comfortably beat last season's surprise package Girona by the same scoreline later on in the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's French striker Mbappé played at home for the first time in a Los Blancos shirt but was largely frustrated by Valladolid's defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde opened the scoring after 50 minutes and substitutes Brahim Diaz and debutant Endrick struck late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without the injured Jude Bellingham Madrid created little in the first half but did enough after the break to earn their first win of the season, following an opening draw at Real Mallorca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still lacking fluency in attack, Carlo Ancelotti's side stayed two points behind rivals Barcelona, who beat Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé scored on his debut in a UEFA Super Cup triumph but in La Liga, has failed to score in his opening two matches. (AFP)

    UK mobile operator warns about smartphones for kids

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767599_1_20240826081103.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Britain's biggest mobile network operators said on Sunday it will warn parents they should not give smartphones to children under the age of 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents about the potential pitfalls of smartphone access for young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent study by the UK communications regulator found around a quarter of British children aged between five and seven-years-old now had a smartphone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EE will say in new guidance that children should only be given phones with "limited capability devices" allowing them only to text and call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will also advise enabling parental control features for teens under the age of 16 and restrictions on social media for the under-13s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK parents have increasingly started to push back against the trend of giving children one of the devices when they transfer from primary to secondary school at the age of 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widely justified on safety grounds in case of an emergency on the way to or from school, parents fear the phones also potentially open children up to online predators, bullying, social pressure and harmful content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While technology and connectivity have the power to transform lives, we recognise the growing complexity of smartphones can be challenging for parents and caregivers," said Mat Sears, EE corporate affairs director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They need support, which is why we are launching new guidelines on smartphone usage for under 11s, 11 to 13-year-olds, and 13 to 16-year-olds to help them make the best choices for their children through these formative years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US author Jonathan Haidt -- whose recent book "The Anxious Generation" argued that smartphones have rewired children's brains -- has urged parents to act together on smartphone access so it becomes the norm for children not to have one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child "breaks our heart" by telling us they are excluded from their peer group by being the only one without a phone, he said earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haidt advocates for no smart phones before the age of 14 or social media before 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These things are hard to do as one parent. But if we all do it together -- if even half of us do it together -- then it becomes much easier for our kids," he added. (AFP)

    Norris beats Verstappen in Dutch Grand Prix

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris celebrates on the podium after winning the Dutch Grand Prix with third placed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767598_1_20240826011450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris stormed to victory at the Dutch Grand Prix on Sunday, a superb drive consigning home favourite Max Verstappen to his first-ever loss in front of his "Orange Army" fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British driver claimed his second career chequered flag after winning in Miami in May, closing Verstappen's lead over him in the world championship to 70 points, with the Dutchman coming second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite raucous encouragement from a packed Zandvoort circuit, Verstappen could not extract enough from his Red Bull to compete with a recently upgraded McLaren that is beginning to look like the car to beat in Formula One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels amazing... The pace was very strong and the car was unbelievable today," said Norris, who also secured a point for the fastest lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The start was critical. Questions have been asked of the starting ability of Norris, who has three times this season failed to convert pole position into a first lap lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And again Norris was sluggish off the line, allowing Verstappen to power around the outside to huge cheers from the crowd, who saw their man take a 0.9-second advantage into the second lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buoyed by the fast start, Verstappen clocked the quickest lap in lap two, putting clear daylight between him and the McLaren of Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the McLaren had been the fastest car in the paddock all race weekend and Norris started slowly but surely eating into Verstappen's lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 17 out of 72, Norris was only a few tenths of a second behind Verstappen, the Dutchman complaining on his team radio of a lack of grip from his tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris passed him a lap later on the outside at turn one, Verstappen powerless to prevent the overtake and quickly falling further behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't go faster. The car is not responding to my inputs," a desperate Verstappen told his engineers as Norris stretched his advantage to more than four seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On lap 25, Verstappen decided enough was enough and he needed a new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris pitted the lap after, his team taking 0.6 seconds longer than the Red Bull for the pit stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, Norris emerged from the two stops five seconds ahead of his rival and promptly produced the fastest lap of the race on his new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 40, Norris had extended the advantage to more than 10 seconds over the three-time champion and just had to stay out of trouble to take the chequered flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His eventual margin of victory was 22.896 seconds, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc holding off Norris's McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri to claim the third podium spot after a thrilling battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's struggling second driver Sergio Perez finished in sixth position, meaning the gap in the constructors' championship also narrowed from 42 points to 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't say a perfect race because of lap one again, but afterwards it was beautiful," said Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expected Max to start pushing and get a bit of a gap. And he never did. So from that point, I knew we were in with a good fight," added Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But he seemed to just keep dropping off. And my pace was getting better. So it's a nice feeling inside the car. And especially when I got past, you know, I could just get comfortable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The F1 circus now moves on to the famous Monza track in Italy next weekend, round 16 of 24 with everyone snapping at Verstappen's heels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has not won a Grand Prix since Barcelona in June, his longest barren spell since 2020 and while it is premature to talk of panic stations at Red Bull, the Dutch weekend will have given some cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You always try to do better and we had a good start, we tried everything we could today, but throughout the race it was quite clear that we are not quick enough, so I tried to be second today," said Verstappen. (AFP)

    Chelsea demolish Wolves, Bournemouth draw with Forest

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chelsea's Noni Madueke holds the match ball after scoring a hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767597_1_20240826004756.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 at Molineux on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chelsea's first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca's side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer, but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves fell part after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side's sixth goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much has been made of Chelsea's huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea's league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today means a lot. I was really just trying to be clever and wait for the right moment," Madueke said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unbelievable. (Palmer) is cold and I am fire so it mixes well. He has the ability to always play a pass at the right time. I like to get the ball in space, beat people and make things happen, so luckily today it worked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair combined to restore Chelsea's lead in the 49th minute with the 22-year-old Madueke getting lucky as his shot deflected off of Rayan Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That goal sapped the fight out of Wolves and it was Palmer again who sent the over-lapping Madueke clear to slam a shot through the legs of Wolves keeper Jose Sa's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke made it 5-2 with an almost identical goal as Wolves conceded possession and Cole sent him clear to complete his hat-trick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves will wonder what happened after they played some enterprising football in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were caught cold when Jackson headed Chelsea in front after two minutes but deservedly levelled in the 27th minute when Cunha fired home after being set up by Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves pressed for a second but it was Chelsea who went back in front on the stroke of halftime with Palmer producing a delightful lobbed finish from 30 metres with his left foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea were caught out again in first-half stoppage time, however, as Norwegian Strand Larsen opened his Wolves account, stretching out his foot to convert from close range after a free kick was headed across the penalty area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Newcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara's effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal," said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe who was given a warm reception on his return to his old club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have had it for us and against us and we are very grateful for that moment because we have battled hard. But I understand that it is a contentious decision." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong martial arts actor Jackie Chan was named on Sunday as one of the torchbearers in the lead-up to the opening ceremony of the Paralympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 70-year-old, known for his stunts and acrobatic fight scenes, will carry the flame on Wednesday afternoon in the French capital just hours before the opening ceremony, the organising committee announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French actress Elsa Zylberstein, and dancer/choreographer Benjamin Millepied will also take part in the torch relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As with the Olympic opening ceremony, Wednesday's event will take place beyond the confines of the Stade de France, with a parade down the Champs-Elysees to the Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame, which was was lit on Saturday in Stoke Mandeville in the UK, the historic birthplace of the Paralympic Games, arrived in France via the Channel Tunnel on Sunday, carried by wheelchair fencing medalist Emmanuelle Assmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about inscribing sport in the hearts of people with disabilities," said French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera who was on hand to welcome the flame, alongside Tony Estanguet, head of the organising committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame was due to continue its journey where it would be "multiplied" into 12 Paralympic flames, which will be carried by 1,000 torchbearers in around 50 towns, in 12 simultaneous relays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These 12 relays will converge on Paris, where the flame will arrive on Wednesday for the opening ceremony. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician said on Sunday that teachers and parents should focus on helping children with special educational needs adapt to social settings, given that the pandemic had a profound impact on these children's physical and mental health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Patrick Ip, clinical professor at HKUMed, said his team found in their research with more than 1,000 children in Hong Kong that many with special educational needs lacked interaction and support during the pandemic and this has affected them since returning back to the classroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that additional support at school and at home is needed to help these children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this critical moment when children are returning to school again, we need to pay particular attention to all our children, in particular those with special educational needs, that we should not overemphasise on school examinations and too much pressure on academic performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, we should support them, back up actually to their resuming to the normal learning environment, and encourage them to actually engage in more recreational and also playful environmental activities so that they could get adapted to the new environment, to build up rapport with their peers and also to engage with their teachers and senior professionals much better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip advised parents to focus on their children's psychological well-being, by encouraging more outdoor activities and sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be aware about the needs of individual children. Let the parents to get involved in assessing and also following up of learning of the individual child, so that they could participate in all those support together with the school teachers, continue with some of the continued training and then understand the needs and emotions of the individual child with SEN also at the family setting," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A community activist group on Sunday called on the government to make sure subdivided flat tenants find housing elsewhere if they are evicted because their homes fail to meet minimum living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came after a government task force submitted suggestions on minimum living standards to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, deputy director of the Society for Community Organization Sze Lai-shan said the group welcomes any measures to improve people's quality of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, she warned that people living in subdivided housing might have to relocate if new rules are brought in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, everyone wants to solve this problem. But they think about if they have this kind of standard, so some of them, they will be closed or they need to move out and then they need to modify it or renovate it," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are afraid they will be homeless."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as calling for the government to ensure such residents find new homes, Sze also said the city's public housing supply should be increased to alleviate the housing shortage.

  The MTR said free shuttle buses were operating between Kowloon Tong and Tai Wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail company said journeys on other parts of the East Rail Line could take longer than normal.

    CE urged to support retail, social welfare sectors

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Propping up the retail industry and providing more support for the social welfare sector were among numerous appeals to Chief Executive John Lee as he held a town hall meeting in Mong Kok on Sunday to solicit views for his upcoming policy address.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens spoke in the two-hour televised forum, including a retail worker who proposed expanding the multiple-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents to other Greater Bay Area cities to attract more mainland tourists to Hong Kong, and consumption vouchers to boost spending locally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Spending is relatively weak. I hope the government can consider distributing local consumption vouchers to encourage residents to stay in Hong Kong to spend. Even if it's a small amount, it's still a gesture," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the CE acknowledged that some sectors are struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although our economy is growing, with the latest figure standing at three percent, challenges remain for certain industries in adapting to this transitional and reshuffling period," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Attracting people is definitely a policy of mine. We will discuss various ways to do this – whether they have been previously raised or they are new ideas – with the central government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some other issues covered focused on social welfare, including whether a three-tier system aimed at preventing suicides among school pupils will continue when it ends this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are assisting pupils who are in need and providing them with counselling services. This is correct and we will continue to do that. The mechanism will also be reviewed by the end of the year," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should also look into how to reduce the number of young people who are in need, including through personality development and raising their ability to handle issues. It's not easy, and this has to be done little by little."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a suggestion to set a minimum space standard for homes, the chief executive said the administration will tackle issues relating to living space and environment in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee is expected to deliver his third annual policy blueprint in October.

    A weaker HK dollar could boost retail sales: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that retail sales could improve in the latter part of this year on the back of a weakening Hong Kong dollar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said an expected US interest rate cut may cause the Hong Kong dollar to weaken, making the SAR a more attractive location to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said upcoming major events should also bring in more tourists, creating a better outlook for retail sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said employment income is continuing to rise, which in turn should also support consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong should also improve competitiveness through the use of technology, and this would bring in new customers and consumption to strengthen the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the economic climate will remain stable for the rest of the year if exports continue to improve, coupled with a fall in external interest rates and improvement in investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said there would be risks to making a special loan guarantee scheme a long-term policy to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with cash flow issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 100 percent loan guarantee scheme was introduced as an extraordinary measure because of the pandemic. It now has more than HK$13 billion of bad debts. If it is implemented as a long-term measure, we need to be cautious, because it may involve moral hazards," he told reporters.

  "The IDF identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory. In response to these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon," the Israel Defence Forces said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 French police arrested Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov on Saturday at an airport near Paris for alleged offences related to the popular messaging app, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the officials told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had just travelled from Baku, in Azerbaijan, another source close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov was expected to appear in court on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's OFMIN, an agency tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov as the coordinating agency in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, one of the sources close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov is suspected of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enough of Telegram's impunity," said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police were on Saturday hunting for a man who, draped in a Palestinian flag, was suspected of setting fires at a synagogue in southern France and triggering an explosion that injured a police officer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the incident was being treated as a potential terror attack and "all means" were being deployed to find the perpetrator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security around Jewish sites was tightened following the attack early on Saturday at Beth Yaacov synagogue in the seaside resort of La Grande Motte, near the city of Montpellier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two cars outside the synagogue were set alight, with a gas canister then likely exploding inside one of the vehicles, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two fires were also started at the entrance of the synagogue, but were quickly put out, with two doors damaged, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officer was injured by the blast after rushing to the scene after the fires were started, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron called the incident "an act of terror", adding on X that "the fight against anti-Semitism is a daily fight".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed" to apprehend the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  La Grande Motte's mayor, Stephan Rossignol, said that CCTV had picked up images of an individual setting fire to the cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On part of the footage, seen and authenticated by AFP, a man is seen with a Palestinian flag draped around his waist, his head covered by a red Palestinian keffiyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man carried two bottles filled with a yellowish liquid. The footage also seems to show the contours of a handgun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources close to the investigation said the suspect left the scene hurriedly on foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fires and explosion come amid a heightened state of alert in France and other European countries because of the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said France's national anti-terror prosecutors had been tasked with probing the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "La Grande Motte's synagogue was the target of an attack this morning," Attal said in a post on X. "An anti-Semitic act. Once again, our Jewish fellow citizens are being targeted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called the incident "an obviously criminal act".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed to find the perpetrator".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police presence outside Jewish sites in France would be increased following the explosion, the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blast occurred during Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest that runs from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday, with many attending synagogue services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was, however, no religious service ongoing at the time of the incident, a police source said. A rabbi and four other people were inside the synagogue at the time but all were unharmed, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town of La Grande Motte has about 8,500 permanent residents but the population swells during the summer tourism season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darmanin said this month that the government had counted 887 anti-Semitic acts in France in the first half of 2024, nearly three times as many as in the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France is home to the biggest Jewish population outside Israel and the United States, and also to the largest Muslim community in the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) called the explosion "an attempt to kill Jews".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The use of a gas canister "in a car at a time when worshippers are expected to arrive at the synagogue is not simply a criminal act", CRIF president Yonathan Arfi told AFP. "This shows an intention to kill." (AFP)

    Astronauts to hitch ride to Earth on SpaceX

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767524_1_20240825014524.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two NASA astronauts who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule will need to return to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle early next year, NASA said on Saturday, deeming issues with Starliner's propulsion system too risky to carry its first crew home.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agency's decision, tapping Boeing's top space rival to return the astronauts, is one of NASA's most consequential in years. Boeing had hoped the test mission would redeem the Starliner program after years of development problems and over US$1.6 billion in budget overruns since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing is also struggling with quality issues on production of commercial planes, its most important products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Starliner's propulsion system suffered a series of glitches beginning in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS, triggering months of cascading delays. Five of its 28 thrusters failed and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare reshuffling of NASA's astronaut operations, the two astronauts are now expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission. Two of the Crew Dragon's four astronaut seats will be kept empty for Wilmore and Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will undock from the ISS without a crew and attempt to return to Earth as it would have with astronauts aboard.

  <br/>
  Boeing struggled for years to develop Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule designed to compete with Crew Dragon as a second US option for sending astronaut crews to and from Earth's orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner failed a 2019 test to launch to the ISS uncrewed, but mostly succeeded in a 2022 do-over attempt where it also encountered thruster problems. Its June mission with its first crew was required before NASA can certify the capsule for routine flights, but now Starliner's crew certification path has been upended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Starliner docked to the ISS in June, Boeing has scrambled to investigate what caused its thruster mishaps and helium leaks. The company arranged tests and simulations on Earth to gather data that it has used to try and convince NASA officials that Starliner is safe to fly the crew back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But results from that testing raised more difficult engineering questions and ultimately failed to quell NASA officials' concerns about Starliner's ability to make its crewed return trip - the most daunting and complex part of the test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NASA's decision, and Starliner's now-uncertain path to certification, will add to the crises faced by new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who started this month with the goal to rebuild the planemaker's reputation after a door panel dramatically blew off a 737 MAX passenger jet in midair in January.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United crashed to a last-gasp 2-1 defeat against Brighton and an Erling Haaland's hat-trick fired Premier League champions Manchester City to a 4-1 win against Ipswich on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's side were left shell-shocked by Joao Pedro's winner five minutes into stoppage-time at the Amex Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United fell behind to a 32nd minute goal from Danny Welbeck, who poked in Kaoru Mitoma's cross for his sixth goal in 16 appearances against his former club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo equalised for United after an hour, cutting inside for a shot that deflected in off Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Zirkzee prevented Alejandro Garnacho from putting the visitors ahead in the closing stages when the United forward touched home his team-mate's finish on the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, a close-season signing from Bologna, was in an offside position and VAR ruled out the goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left completely unmarked at the far post, Brazilian striker Pedro rubbed salt into United's wounds as he headed home from Simon Adingra's cross to ensure Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler maintained his 100 per cent start following last weekend's win at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old German is the youngest permanent manager in Premier League history after arriving from St Pauli to replace Roberto De Zerbi in the close-season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team deserved to win. These moments make memories and we have to enjoy it," Hurzeler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag added: "Both goals are very soft. As a team, we should have done better. We have to be more clinical in both boxes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City scored three times in four minutes to survive an early scare against promoted Ipswich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sammie Szmodics, signed from Blackburn in the close-season, gave Ipswich a shock lead in the seventh minute, running on to Omari Hutchinson's pass and squeezing his shot through Ederson's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City levelled when Leif Davis's 12th minute foul on Savinho conceded a penalty that Haaland dispatched with ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich keeper Arijanet Muric spent four years with City before leaving in 2022 and he returned with a gift for his old club, dwelling in possession in the 14th minute as Kevin De Bruyne stole the ball and slotted home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City made it three when the unstoppable Haaland flicked De Bruyne's deft pass past Muric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German midfielder Ilkay Gundogan came off the bench for City in the second half after rejoining his former club from Barcelona on a one-year contract on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland completed his treble in the 88th minute with a typically predatory finish for his fourth goal already this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma got back in favour with boss Ange Postecoglou as his superb strike inspired a 4-0 rout of Everton in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou picker Bissouma following a one-game suspension after posting a social media video that showed him inhaling nitrous oxide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know what it's like when you punish your child and they do everything right for the next two days?" Postecoglou had said of Bissouma's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mali international made the most of his reprieve in the 14th minute, lashing home from the edge of the area for his first league goal for Tottenham in his 52nd appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Son Heung-min doubled Tottenham's lead in the 25th minute, forcing Jordan Pickford into an embarrassing mistake as the Everton keeper was robbed by the South Korean for a simple finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero headed Tottenham's third in the 71st minute. Son bagged his second with a clinical finish six minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui earned the first win of his reign as second half goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen sealed a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Iwobi's 70th minute goal clinched Fulham's 2-1 win against Leicester at Craven Cottage after Emile Smith Rowe's first half opener for the hosts was cancelled out by Wout Faes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nottingham Forest won 1-0 at Southampton thanks to Morgan Gibbs-White's 70th minute strike.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they had arrested 11 people who allegedly used Hong Kong as a base for phone scams involving the impersonation of customer service officers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force claims the suspects, who include six Malaysian nationals, are linked to a transnational syndicate responsible for the theft of HK$61 million in over 400 scams since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrests came after officers raided four offices in San Po Kong and Kowloon Bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 20 and 67, are accused of conspiracy to defraud, using false instruments, and money laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The locals were allegedly responsible for duties, such as renting the centres and providing the syndicate with a large number of local prepaid SIM cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force seized 87 model-pool devices,15 computers and over 80,000 prepaid SIM cards in the raids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Lee Chun-man of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said surveillance cameras had been installed in the centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is believed the cameras allowed senior members of the syndicate to monitor the operation, as well as the workers' performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee pointed out that the Malaysian suspects came to Hong Kong as tourists, and were paid around HK$10,000 to HK$16,000 each month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from being responsible for using falsified identification documents or travel documents to register SIM cards, their duties also included managing the modem-pool devices by changing SIM cards in the devices around the clock, so as to ensure that the telecommunication network could be operated 24 hours a day," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said that between May and August this year, three of the Malaysian suspects had allegedly made use of computer software to modify their passports and the ID cards of others, so as to complete the real-name registration for at least 300 SIM cards.

 Ocean Park said on Saturday that its animal care team had prepared a cub-scented doll for giant panda Ying Ying, before her twin babies reunite with her.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The mother giant panda gave birth to one female and one male cub last week, and the park's team has been closely monitoring the twins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media page, the park said before reintroducing the babies to Ying Ying, she would be given a cub-scented doll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The doll can help Ying Ying stay familiar with the cub's scent, and also let the caretakers observe and evaluate Ying Ying’s behaviour when she interacts with the scented doll," it wrote.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it will continue to observe the impact of the discharge on food safety. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767495_1_20240824155901.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau on Saturday said it's not ruling out further action concerning Hong Kong's banning of aquatic products from Japan following wastewater discharges from the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In August last year, the SAR government gazetted a food safety order that banned aquatic products from 10 Japanese prefectures, after Japanese authorities released treated wastewater from the power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media, the bureau said the Japanese government had claimed that the water met international standards after being diluted and filtered, and it demanded the SAR government lift the import ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it had told the Japanese authorities that the release of wastewater was unprecedented, and there would be catastrophic consequences on marine ecology and food safety if there were any error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the government had to take precautionary measures, and it's not ruling out taking further action to safeguard the SAR's food safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the government will continue to observe the impact of the discharge, by looking at scientific data and reports by Japanese authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hang Seng Bank senior advisor George Leung on Saturday said he hopes to see an upturn in the here economy now that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, looks set to begin a cycle of interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The forecasted rate cuts, I believe, will help alleviate pressure on SME [small and medium enterprise] interest payments and this will have a relatively large impact when it comes to boosting the economy," he said on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the time had come for the United States to start cutting interest rates, adding that his confidence had grown that the battle against inflation is on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he expects the Fed to announce a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, and that its benchmark interest rate may be half a percentage point lower by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed held the rate at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, at its last meeting, for the eighth time in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said most bank loans here have interest rates priced off the interbank offered rate instead of the best lending rate. He said he expected this rate to come down once the Fed had cut its benchmark interest rate.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 40-year-old man remains in police custody after trying to ram his way out of a police roadblock on Friday night in Ho Man Tin, injuring a police officer. Speaking to the press on Saturday morning, the police said the man faces seven charges, including trafficking in dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a briefing with reporters, Superintendent Tsui Suk-yee said police received a report at 7 pm of a private car driving erratically in Kowloon City and Hung Hom and that red lights had allegedly been jumped and the vehicle driven in the opposite direction to the traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 8 pm, officers found that the vehicle had come to a halt with the rest of the traffic on Princess Margaret Road, where police had put up a roadblock. Police said the vehicle then tried to ram its way free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The car allegedly hit a police officer and dragged him along the road but officers, who had drawn their guns, eventually detained the suspect. Four other private cars were also damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police strongly condemns the arrested man for disregarding the safety of road users and officers executing their duty. It's a very irresponsible act," Superintendent Tsui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers later found suspected drugs in the vehicle, including methamphetamine, crack cocaine and ketamine, with a total market value of over HK$20,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they also found a Hong Kong identity card which did not belong to the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the driver did not have a driving licence and the vehicle had been rented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial investigation, when the arrested person rented a car, he got a valid driving licence. However, until Friday, his driving license had been expired," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was arrested on suspicion of taking conveyance without authority, furious driving, assaulting police officers, trafficking in dangerous drugs, possessing other's identity card, driving without a licence and driving without a third party risk insurance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said the government will continue its work on raising living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a social media video message, Lee said consultation meetings will be held with different parties about his upcoming Policy Address, and he will also be going out into the community to hear suggestions from the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current-term government is committed to enhancing people's livelihoods. We implement in detail and make Hong Kong a better place for living and working," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We work hard in aspects of medical care, child care, transportation and housing, making Hong Kong a better place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured people from the transport sector, low income groups, and the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albert Leung from Citybus said after changing the tolls for Hong Kong's three harbour tunnels, traffic congestion at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel had been improved and it had also enhanced the competitiveness of buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A family living in a subdivided flat said they regularly visited the community living room, and there were teachers helping with homework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman living in Zhongshan on the mainland said the elderly health care voucher scheme had been expanded to cover more medical institutions in the Greater Bay Area, and this was more convenient for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive will hold a second public consultation on the Policy Address on Sunday, alongside several ministers. The address itself will be delivered in October.

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Saturday said the authorities have no plans to roll out a 100 percent loan guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) again.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced details about establishing a new task force to help SMEs deal with their loan payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government launched a special 100 percent loan guarantee scheme during the pandemic to help SMEs cope with cash flow problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, the minister said it was a "special measure" during the Covid-19 pandemic, and about HK$140 billion was approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy is gradually recovering now, if a 100 percent loan guarantee is maintained, it would be a great burden on the government. We will closely monitor the situation, but we don't have any plans to roll out the scheme again in the meantime," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said the government needs "careful consideration", as the default rate of the scheme reached 9.2 percent, which means the default amount was HK$13.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the SAR's economic and trade offices (ETOs) being suppressed by the United States and western countries, Yau said the government had a determined stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were voices from the United States and western countries asking to shut down our ETOs. But we should continue with our work, and shouldn't retreat just because of some opinions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage, the ETOs are running normally. The countries still haven't had further action, so we shouldn't retreat. They're just scaring us, and we shouldn't kneel down."

    Nasa to decide on Boeing Starliner ISS astronauts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa is expected to decide Saturday whether two astronauts who arrived at the International Space Station aboard Boeing's Starliner should return on that craft -- or brace for a longer wait to fly home with rival SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latter solution would not only create a fresh public relations headache for Boeing, but possibly result in astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams spending a total of eight months in orbit, not the eight days as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A decision-making committee, with Nasa chief Bill Nelson sitting in, will meet Saturday to weigh the tough issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US space agency has tentatively scheduled a news conference for 1:00 pm (1700 GMT), presumably to announce its verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After years of Starliner development delays, the spacecraft finally lifted off in early June carrying Wilmore and Williams, both veteran astronauts, to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule was originally set to bring them to Earth after eight days in space, but Nasa put their return on indefinite hold as it studied problems with the craft's propulsion system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials are weighing the highly unusual option of bringing the two astronauts back from the flying laboratory not on their own craft, but aboard a previously scheduled SpaceX vehicle in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engineers at Boeing and Nasa have spent weeks conducting intensive tests on the Starliner's systems, trying to get to the root of the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their worry is that the craft might not have the propulsive power to wrest itself out of orbit and begin the descent toward Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Nasa experts decide the Starliner is not safe, the craft would return without any passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SpaceX Crew-9 mission would then take off in late September, but carrying only two passengers instead of the originally planned four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would remain moored to the ISS until its scheduled return in February, bringing back its own crew members plus their two stranded colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an approach would be a stinging blow to the already tarnished image of US giant Boeing, whose airplane arm has been beset in recent years with concerns about safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten years ago, following the retirement of the Space Shuttle, Nasa ordered new vessels from both Boeing and SpaceX that could ferry astronauts to and from the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With two such vehicles available, Nasa reasoned, there would always be a backup in case one of the two experienced problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Elon Musk's SpaceX beat Boeing to the punch and has been the lone vehicle used to taxi astronauts for the past four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's crewed Starliner flight, which followed years of delays and disappointments during the craft's development, was meant to be a last test of the vehicle before it enters regular operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa has said the astronauts on the ISS have plenty of supplies, are trained for extended stays and have plenty of experiments to conduct. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Friday said it strongly disapproves and rejects what it described as biased reporting by the New York Times on the new National Security Exhibition Gallery at the Hong Kong History Museum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said an article headlined "A History Museum Shows How China Wants to Remake Hong Kong" carried false and misleading narratives against the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said the newspaper had “completely ignored the large-scale and incessant riots that occurred in 2019 and the very fact of the failed attempt to stage the Hong Kong version of 'colour-revolution', which have continuously devastated society, livelihood and economy of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It has also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community, and the business environment as well, to return to normalcy. The New York Times has demonstrated hypocrisy with double standards.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said visitors had been coming in droves to the gallery, with 10,000 entering by the end of its fourth day, and that it had received positive reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The untruthful reporting of the New York Times article about the gallery is completely out of order and twisting the facts,” the spokesman added.

    Three dead in German festival knife attack

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Emergency services at the scene of the attack in Solingen. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767456_1_20240824063306.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people were killed and four severely wounded in a knife attack at a festival in the western German city of Solingen on Friday, according to a spokeswoman for the police in nearby Duesseldorf.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police have launched a "major operation" to find the suspect, who is on the run, the spokeswoman said, adding that a "wide area" had been cordoned off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were at the scene with helicopters and emergency vehicles, and had asked the public to avoid the area, according to the broadcaster ZDF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was part of a series of events to celebrate the city's 650th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted online, Tim-Oliver Kurzbach, the mayor of Solingen, said the whole city was in "shock, horror and great grief".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all wanted to celebrate our town's anniversary together and now we have to mourn the dead and injured," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kurzbach thanked the emergency services for their work at the scene and expressed sympathy with those who had witnessed the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It tears my heart apart that there was an attack on our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost. I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solingen is a city of some 150,000 people located an equal distance from Duesseldorf and Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People had gathered in the town on Friday evening for the first day of a three-day "Festival of Diversity", according to the event's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was set to feature music, street theatre, variety shows and comedians in the city centre and several other areas, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to 75,000 visitors were expected to attend over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Solinger Tageblatt newspaper reported that one of the co-organisers of the festival had come on stage to cancel the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd were also asked to leave the city centre, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the announcement, thousands of attendees cleared the area, the paper reported, with a journalist at the scene describing the atmosphere as "ghostly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People left the scene in shock, but calmly," Philipp Mueller, one of the organisers, told the newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness who spoke to the Tageblatt said he was a few metres from the attack, not far from the stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said the man, Lars Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who was drunk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground and several pools of blood, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has seen a series of knife attacks over the past 12 months, with Interior Minister Nancy Faeser promising to crack down on knife crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police officer was killed and five people were wounded in a knife attack at a far-right rally in the city of Mannheim in late May. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Friday as dovish remarks from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell solidified expectations that the central bank will cut its key policy rate in September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In highly anticipated comments before the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, Powell said "the time has come" to lower the Fed funds target rate, and "the upside risks of inflation have diminished".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The long wait is over," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. "This was the dovish shift that market participants have been waiting for."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is clearly turning to the dovish camp and Powell has made it crystal clear that September will be the start of multiple rate cuts coming the remainder of this year," Detrick added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock indexes jumped after the release of Powell's prepared remarks, with megacaps Nvidia, Apple and Tesla providing the most muscle. Small caps and regional banks were outperformers, rising 3.2 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Financials are at an all-time high, with a huge surge from regional banks," Detrick said. "One would think if a major calamity or a recession were on the horizon, regional banks and financials wouldn't be as strong as they’ve been."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes logged weekly advances, standing on the shoulders of last week's largest Friday-to-Friday percentage gains of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next week, the data-dependent Fed will have a raft of economic indicators to consider ahead of its September rate decision, including the Commerce Department's revised second-quarter GDP and its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which includes the Fed's preferred inflation yardstick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.14 percent, to 41,175, the S&P 500 gained 1.15 percent, to 5,635 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.47 percent, to 17,878.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workday beat quarterly revenue expectations and announced a US$1 billion stock buyback plan, sending shares of the human resources software firm up 12.5 percent, the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ross Stores gained 1.8 percent after the discount retailer raised its fiscal 2024 profit forecast. Turbo Tax's parent Intuit sagged 6.8 percent in response to disappointing quarterly revenue. (Reuters)

    Independent Kennedy drops US poll bid, backs Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Robert F Kennedy Jr announces that he's dropping his presidential run. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767443_1_20240824033757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20 percent of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, US President John F Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy said on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts. (Reuters)

    In Kyiv, Modi says diplomacy can end Ukraine crisis

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Narendra Modi is greeted by Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the Indian leader makes a historic visit to Kyiv. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767440_1_20240824015244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday to sit down for talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine and offered to act as a friend to help bring peace as the two leaders met in wartime Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history comes at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in Februaru 2022, with Moscow making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The optics closely resembled the Indian leader's visit to Moscow last month where he called for peace and embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, angering Ukraine where a Russian missile strike hit a children's hospital on the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The road to resolution can only be found through dialogue and diplomacy. And we should move in that direction without wasting any time. Both sides should sit together to find a way out of this crisis," Modi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to assure you that India is ready to play an active role in any efforts towards peace. If I can play any role in this personally, I will do that, I want to assure you as a friend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what Kyiv made of his remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, which traditionally has close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war, but also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both leaders described Modi's visit as "historic" in their statements, in which Modi spoke second and Zelenskiy did not have an opportunity to respond to the call for dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskiy said that "the matter of ending the war and a just peace are the priority for Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that talks were out of the question after Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An aide to former British PM Rishi Sunak was among those accused of placing bets on the election date. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767438_1_20240824011046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police announced on Friday that a probe into betting on the date of the last general election had ended, saying the bar for misconduct had not been met.
 <br>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said in late June it would investigate a "small number" of bets placed on the timing of last month's elections, as part of a joint probe with the gambling watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scandal overshadowed the latter stages of campaigning ahead of the July 5 poll, after it emerged senior Conservative officials and one of then-prime minister Rishi Sunak's aides had placed bets shortly before he announced the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met also arrested one of its officers on suspicion of misconduct in public office over election betting claims, while six other officers were identified as having placed bets on its date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission launched an investigation into whether any broke laws on "cheating" while the Met opened a separate inquiry into whether other criminal offences had been committed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While political bets are allowed in the UK, using insider knowledge to make them is against the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Britain's biggest police force announced its criminal investigation had concluded with no action being taken, including against the officer who had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met said the "high bar" for proving misconduct in public office had not been met, following advice from the country's prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission investigation remains ongoing and could still result in criminal charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile the Met's internal watchdog unit is continuing to investigate the seven officers alleged to have placed bets on the election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These allegations caused a significant dent in public confidence during the election campaign and it was right that they were investigated to explore all possible offences," Detective Superintendent Katherine Goodwin said in a statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday offered an explicit endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job market would be unwelcome and expressing confidence that inflation was within reach of the US central bank's 2 percent target.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased," Powell said in a highly anticipated speech to the Kansas City Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referencing the two goals that the Fed is tasked by Congress to achieve, Powell said his "confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent," after rising to about 7 percent during the Covid-19 pandemic, while unemployment is increasing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Powell said the jump of nearly a percentage point in the unemployment rate over the past year was due largely to rising labour supply and slowed hiring, not increased layoffs, he also was emphatic that the Fed wanted to prevent any further erosion – his prior talk of labour market "pain" as necessary to control inflation now a thing of the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current unemployment rate of 4.3 percent is roughly at the level Fed officials feel is consistent with stable inflation over the longer run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labour market conditions," Powell said. "We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labour market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders on Friday continued to bet on a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed's September 17-18 meeting, but after Powell's remarks priced in about a one-in-three chance of a bigger half-percentage-point cut, up from a little more than a one-in-four probability earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell was clear about the first rate cut, but not so much about the next ones, so I don't think he'll be exploding out of the blocks with a 50-basis-point cut," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "I think slow and steady is how the Fed wants to pace this early part of the easing." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer was injured during an operation on Princess Margaret Road on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video circulating online, swarms of officers had surrounded a northbound silver vehicle opposite Hung Hom Divisional Police Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of them had drawn their guns and demanded the driver pull over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the driver refused to cooperate, and tried to break free from the road block by jolting back and forth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver eventually came to a halt after colliding with another vehicle, before being apprehended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One officer who was hit in the waist was helped up by other colleagues, and led onto a police van.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second driver caught in the incident suffered neck injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All northbound lanes of the major thoroughfare were sealed off at around 8.40pm, causing severe traffic disruption.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed the success of his administration in attracting foreign talent and businesses to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video message as part of his Policy Address consultation, Lee said officials have gone all out to look for new opportunities over the past year, despite facing many challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Hong Kong is going through economic transformation, we have continuously strengthened our efforts to grab talent and attract enterprises and capital to Hong Kong," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With a special focus on innovation and technology, we pursue development in new quality productive forces and reinforce our status as an international financial centre, aviation hub and trade centre. We will build Hong Kong into a global hub for high-calibre talent and strive for economic growth and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured a number of people who decided to set up shop in Hong Kong recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Daniel Seah, the chief executive of Los Angeles-based Digital Domain, an Oscar-winning production house specialising in visual effects for movies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I deal with officials in Hong Kong, they are clear about what this place needs. They are also clear about what our company needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A research and development base is most crucial for a company, especially for us since we are built on technology."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of July, Hong Kong has engaged over 100 strategic and innovation and technology enterprises which agreed to set up or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have generated investment of HK$52 billion and created more than 15,000 jobs.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.
