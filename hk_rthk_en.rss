<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 32 civilians were killed and 63 injured in an explosion on a popular beach in the Somali capital Mogadishu late on Friday evening, police said, an attack blamed by Somali state media on the militant Islamist group al Shabaab.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the deadliest attack in the Horn of Africa country since twin car bombs detonated near a busy market intersection in October 2022, killing at least 100 people and wounding 300 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate claim of responsibility by the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab, which has claimed similar attacks in the past, including the car bomb attack in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police spokesperson Abdifatah Aden gave the death toll in Friday evening's explosion at a beach restaurant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the civilians killed, Aden said that one of the attackers had blown himself up while three others had been killed by security forces. One attacker was captured alive while one soldier was killed during the assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State news agency SONNA had earlier said five al Shabaab attackers had been killed by security forces while a sixth had blown himself up during the assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hassan Farah, a survivor, described the shock as the explosion shattered a peaceful evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was in the restaurant sipping coffee and having a good chat with friends when I saw a big man running, in a second there was something like lightening and a huge blast," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were covered with smoke. Inside and outside the restaurant many people were lying on the floor while others were bleeding and crying." (Reuters)

    HK sprinter Felix Diu unable to advance in 100m

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu (R) was very close to advancing to the next round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764597_1_20240803171726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu was on Saturday eliminated in the preliminary round of the men’s 100m race, finishing fourth in his heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He was unable to establish a new SAR record with a time of 10.62 seconds, just 0.02 seconds short of coming in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Noa Jerrel Bibi of Mauritius came first in the heat with a time of 10.27 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu's time was 0.34 seconds short of the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top two in each heat and the four fastest runners from the rest of the pack can advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100-metre specialist entered the Olympics through a wild card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic qualification for the 100m dash is 10 seconds and Diu’s personal best, which is also his best time this year, is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the race, Diu expressed disappointment with his performance, saying he had been dealing with a leg injury, and that has affected his training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, my condition wasn't as good as it was when I clocked a 10.33, so perhaps I will just work harder next time, and in competitions next year," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While being the third Hong Kong sprinter in history to make it to the 100m race at the Games, the sprinter, 24, said he learnt quite a lot from his "unforgettable" Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a rather shocking and exciting experience. There are so many spectators in the stadium cheering for athletes, it's really something different."

    Cathay to increase flights to Phnom Penh

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cathay Pacific says it will step up flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764594_2_20240803172132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Saturday announced it will offer daily flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh from October 27, up from the current five trips per week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came after the CEO of the SAR's flag carrier, Ronald Lam, signed an agreement to boost its partnership with Cambodia Airports during Chief Executive John Lee's recent six-day Asean trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision is also part of Cathay's plan to prepare for the completion of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group emphasised that it will continue to strengthen its existing routes, as well as expand its network and collaboration with Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, this year marks the 75th anniversary since Cathay operated its inaugural flight to Vietnam. The airline announced that it will kick off another round of recruitment in the country this month, after welcoming more than 170 Vietnamese flight attendants earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And low-cost airline Hong Kong Express, which is owned by Cathay, is planning to start flights between Hong Kong and Phu Quoc – a Vietnamese island – in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay currently flies to 17 Asean destinations, with over 360 flights per week.

 Customs on Saturday said they arrested three men after finding nearly HK$6 million worth of suspected heroin inside a shipment of durians and mochi at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said the air consignment containing 8.4 kilogrammes of the drug came from Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers on Friday found 24 packs of heroin in the shipment, which was declared as carrying the pungent fruit and mochi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then arrested three men aged 25 to 53 in Mong Kok on the same day during a "controlled delivery operation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added an investigation is ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority has taken back 5,000 public rental housing units from tenants over the past two years, after they were found to have been abusing public housing resources, the Director of Housing Rosanna Law said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Law pointed out that the figure is equivalent to a medium-sized public housing estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chun Yeung Estate in Fo Tan provides around 4,800 units. Therefore, by recovering 5,000 units due to tenancy abuse is equivalent to a medium-sized estate," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the recovered flats are located in developed or urban areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said renovation for the retrieved flats would only take a few months, and they then could be allocated to people on the waiting list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department has been working with property management companies to combat tenancy abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far, 38 flats have been taken back after companies filed reports of suspected system abuse, and Law said the results are "very encouraging".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had required 250,000 public housing tenants residing for over 10 years to submit an income and assets declaration form by the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the programme, Law revealed that it has already received 254,000 forms, which is more than 99 per cent of all the households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are 70 units from which we have not received declaration forms, despite repeated chasing and reminders. For these, we have already started our process of taking back their housing units."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official also added that the Housing Authority hadn't set any target on how many public rental housing units it would take back this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the beginning of this financial year 2024-25, we have already up to date resumed 700 flats, under the anti-abuse campaign. So we are expecting similar numbers in the coming seasons, and the overall full year figures should be similar to previous years," she said.

    'Cybersecurity bill not a threat to privacy'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Security Bureau Chief Chris Tang said the proposed cybersecurity bill will only focus on protecting computer systems from hackers. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764572_1_20240803115813.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security Bureau Chief Chris Tang said on Saturday the proposed legislation to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity will not undermine privacy protection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment after the bureau submitted a paper to the Legislative Council, that would require the reporting of cybersecurity incidents by operators crucial to the normal functioning of society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the bureau would only focus on protecting computer systems from hackers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly the legislation targets critical infrastructure, there will be no effect on small- and medium-sized enterprises and individuals. Secondly, we have no interest in the personal information and the operational information included in the critical infrastructure. Our goal is to protect the system so it will not be attacked and therefore affect members of the public when services are disrupted," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang highlighted that the government will only view company's information after obtaining a warrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed legislative framework, operators are required to set up a computer system security management unit, conduct a security risk assessment at least once every year, and an independent security audit at least once every two years, and report serious security incidents within two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penalties ranging from HK$500,000 to HK$5 million will apply to organisations that fail to comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the bureau received 53 submissions throughout the bill's consultation period, which came to an end on Thursday. Among all submissions, 47 of them were from industry sectors. 52 supported the proposed law and one from a United Kingdom human rights organisation opposed it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such legislation is not unique to Hong Kong. Similar regulations are also implemented in Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that radio stations and television broadcasters are critical infrastructures, and the government will not intervene in day-to-day operations of newsrooms and news content.

    Vietnam names To Lam as top leader

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vietnam's Communist Party named President To Lam as the country's top leader on Saturday, after the death of his predecessor two weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This morning, August 3, 2024, the Party Central Committee... elected To Lam the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam," the party said at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party's general secretary is the most powerful figure in Vietnam's leadership structure, with the president occupying a largely ceremonial role that includes meeting foreign counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear if Lam would continue to serve as president simultaneously or relinquish that role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first remarks as general secretary, Lam said his promotion resulted from "an urgent need to ensure the leadership of the party".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a huge honour with glorious responsibility before the party and the people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nomination comes two weeks after the death of General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He died in the capital Hanoi "due to old age and serious illness" and Lam was informally handed the reins of power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam's formal succession to the top job follows a long career within the public security ministry. (AFP)

    Kim Jong-un hits out at Seoul over flooding reports

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un accused South Korean media outlets of spreading rumours about flood damage and casualties in his country, state media said on Saturday, days after Seoul reached out to offer humanitarian aid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  North Korea said earlier this week there had been unspecified casualties resulting from the flooding in its northern regions, in addition to damage to thousands of homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul on Thursday said it was willing to "urgently provide" humanitarian assistance to "North Korean disaster victims" following a South Korean news report that the toll of dead and missing could be as high as 1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by TV Chosun, which was later picked up by other outlets, also reported on the possible death of rescue workers killed in helicopter crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But North Korea's Kim slammed the reports for "spreading the false rumour that the human loss ... is expected be over 1,000 or 1,500", according to Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim "bitterly censured the inveterate habits and despicable nature of the ROK scum," referring to South Korea, KCNA said Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flooding reports constituted a South Korean "smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish" the North's image, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang said on Wednesday that officials who neglected their disaster prevention duties had caused unspecified casualties, without specifying the location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said on Saturday that there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said suffered the "greatest flood damage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter "within a few hours".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, but South Korea's unification and foreign ministries this week expressed condolences for the North's flood victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul said on Friday it had received no response after trying to offer humanitarian aid via the Koreas' liaison office communication channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea declared the South its principal enemy earlier this year, and Pyongyang has not responded to inter-Korean liaison hotline calls since April 2023. (AFP)

 <br>
  <br/>
  Lu Lei, the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, and Howard Lee, the deputy chief executive of the HKMA, also signed a memorandum of understanding on the linkage of cross-boundary payment systems.

    France win over Argentina sparks ugly scenes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The trouble flared at full-time between the now arch-rivals. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764542_1_20240803061813.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's grudge match with Argentina ended in ugly scenes after Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal to put the hosts into the Olympic semi-finals on Friday with a 1-0 win, joining Spain, Morocco and Egypt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tensions spilled over at full-time in Bordeaux with rival players and staff clashing on the pitch and confrontations continuing down the tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Palace striker Mateta struck five minutes into the quarter-final, meeting Michael Olise's corner with a superb near-post header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That proved enough for the hosts, coached by Thierry Henry, to reach the last four, where they face Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's clash was the first meeting of the nations since Argentina players were recorded singing racist chants about their French counterparts as they celebrated winning the Copa America in mid-July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifa announced it would investigate the chants, which targeted France's star striker Kylian Mbappe among others and included racist and homophobic insults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentina team were met with a hostile welcome, where the crowd loudly jeered their national anthem as the sides met for the first time since the 2022 World Cup final, which the South Americans won on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry said midfielder Enzo Millot, who had been substituted late on, was shown a red card after the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He wasn't on the pitch. Maybe you get sent off because you get a second yellow card to stop someone running through on goal, not when you are on the bench. I am really not happy about that," Henry told broadcaster France 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giuliano Simeone and Julian Alvarez missed chances for Javier Mascherano's Argentina, and the exit of the two-time gold medallists means the winner of men's football gold will not come from Latin America for the first time since Cameroon triumphed in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France could have won by a wider margin, but Olise had a late second goal disallowed for a foul in the build-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will now be heavy favourites to win a semi-final in Lyon on Monday against Egypt, who beat Paraguay 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ibrahim Adel was Egypt's hero, scoring a late equaliser in normal time and then converting the winning penalty in the shoot-out, in which Paraguay's Marcelo Perez was the only player to fail to score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier a brilliant brace by Barcelona's Fermin Lopez helped fire Spain to a 3-0 win over Japan in Lyon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lopez, a member of Spain's triumphant Euro 2024 squad, blasted in the opener from range in the 11th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Barcelona midfielder struck again on 73 minutes with another goal of the highest quality as he controlled a Sergio Gomez corner before volleying in from the edge of the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Abel Ruiz wrapped up the win for Spain, Olympic champions in 1992 and silver medallists three years ago in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain go through to a last-four clash in Marseille with Morocco, who outclassed the United States, winning 4-0 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soufiane Rahimi opened the scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled in the box just before the half-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a fifth goal in four games for the tournament's top scorer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morocco doubled their lead on 63 minutes when Abde Ezzalzouli set up Ilias Akhomach to finish at the near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Achraf Hakimi, playing on his Paris Saint-Germain home ground, ran through to make it 3-0 and substitute Mehdi Maouhoub added another penalty in stoppage time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we keep playing like this we will deserve to be in the final," said Akhomach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other countries might be talked about more than us but we know what we want. We came here to win." (AFP)

    Violence flares in UK city as police brace for more

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protests and counter-protests are expected across the UK this weekend. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764534_1_20240803052752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rioting flared late on Friday in Sunderland, northeast England, where police said officers were subjected to "serious violence," the latest unrest following a mass stabbing earlier this week that killed three young girls.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage shared on social media and broadcast by the BBC showed a mob of several hundred rampaging in Sunderland's city centre, attacking police and setting fire to at least one car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as police nationwide prepared for planned far-right rallies and other demonstrations this weekend, after two nights of unrest in several English towns and cities in the wake of Monday's knife attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said it had a "proportionate and risk-based" plan for rival pro-Palestinian and anti-immigration protests on Saturday. Late on Wednesday, its officers arrested 111 people as a rally in Westminster turned violent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Friday night's disturbances in Sunderland were an ominous sign for the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our officers are continuing to deal with ongoing disorder and have been subjected to serious violence," Northumbria Police said of the situation there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scenes that we are seeing are completely unacceptable," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional mayor Kim McGuinness said she was "appalled" at the fresh eruption of violence, this time in the northeast, which followed a calm night on Thursday across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If your response to tragedy is to use it to commit violence, to abuse others, attack the police and damage property you stand for nothing except thuggery," she said on X, echoing comments by Prime Minister Keir Starm on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Merseyside Police said extra officers had been deployed in and around Liverpool city centre "to help prevent disorder or criminality" there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed social media reports of planned far-right gatherings and counter-protests in the northwest English city, which lies close to the seaside town of Southport where Monday's knife attack occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right elements have been blamed for the disturbances in the aftermath of the stabbing spree targeting children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have said online misinformation about the British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana has helped fuel the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He faces murder and attempted murder charges over the stabbing rampage that also left five children and two adults critically wounded and which has shocked Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said the case is not being treated as terror-related but have not revealed a motive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anger over the tragedy has fused with growing anti-immigration sentiment on the right of English politics, pushed by openly Islamophobic far-right figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After violence in Southport late on Tuesday, unrest rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Southport, the mob targeted a mosque, prompting hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security amid fears of more anti-Islamic demonstrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faith leaders says mosques have been hiring paid security staff and checking their CCTV cameras are working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Muslim community is deeply anxious right now," said Zara Mohammed, secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts will "face the full force of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In power for less than a month, Starmer met on Friday with local leaders in Southport to discuss "a package of support for the local community," his Downing Street office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's visit came the day after he announced a new "national capability" to tackle disorder in the wake of the recent disturbances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new measures will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police nationwide were mobilising for trouble this weekend, after far-right social media channels advertised "enough is enough" anti-immigrant rallies and anti-facism groups vowed to stage counter-protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enough is enough" has emerged as a rallying online slogan for the far-right and others following Monday's attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Yorkshire police said on Friday it knew of a planned protest in the town of Rotherham and that people might see "an increased police presence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers in south Wales said a policing operation would be in place for events being planned for Saturday in Cardiff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police in Northern Ireland noted social media posts calling for roadblocks "using women and children," as well as a march to an Islamic centre in Belfast on Saturday. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Despite being cheered on by a rabid crowd inside Court Philippe Chatrier, Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen were denied a first tennis gold for China in two decades.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of clinching a first Olympic tennis gold medal in two decades were dashed as the nation's mixed doubles pair came up short against the Czech Republic in a thrilling final which ended at nearly midnight, Paris time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen were broken twice in the opening set, which they conceded after just 23 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after settling in, the pair were neck and neck against Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machac. Set two lasted nearly twice as long, with Wang and Zhang taking it 7-5 in 40 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the match at one set apiece, a 10-point tiebreak ensued to decide who would be gold medallists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raucous Chinese supporters inside Court Philippe Chatrier were in a frenzy after their side went up 3-0. But the Czechs levelled the score and bagged the last four points of the match, including a crucial double fault by their opponents at 8-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dramatic slip-up meant China had to make do with a silver. It was still the first tennis medal for the nation since Zheng Jie and Yan Zi struck bronze in the women's doubles in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed a gold by Li Ting and Sun Tiantian in the same discipline in Athens four years prior.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joris Daudet led a French clean sweep of the podium in men's Olympic BMX racing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His compatriots Sylvain Andre and Romain Mahieu took silver and bronze in front of an ecstatic home crowd in the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines stadium, finally winning the Olympic medals that had so long eluded them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French have dominated BMX racing in recent decades, amassing 50 gold medals at world championships since 1982, and Daudet and Mahieu are first and second in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Olympics, however, they had only bagged two medals - both by female riders - since the sport's debut in Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Dutchman Niek Kimmann unable to defend his Tokyo 2021 title due to illness and Tokyo silver medalist Kye Whyte of Britain hampered by a back injury, the French dominated their semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron, the three French riders shot out of the starting ramp and maintained their lead throughout the final, zooming over the bumpy, winding course in a 1-2-3 formation like one blue-and-white streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BMX race, Saya Sakakibara of Australia won gold, Manon Veenstra of the Netherlands took silver and Zoe Claessens of Switzerland claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sakakibara and Mahieu, who are dating each other, will go home with a medal each - one gold, one bronze - at the same Games and in the same discipline. (Reuters)

Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764530_1_20240803044225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday following a disappointing US jobs report that raised recession worries while also boosting the odds of interest rate cuts by the Fed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy added 114,000 jobs last month, a drop from the prior month and fewer than expected, while the jobless rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest level since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report added to recession fears following lacklustre manufacturing data on Thursday, with losses in the week's final two days leaving all three major indices down for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 39,737, down 1.5 percent for the day and 2.1 percent for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 fell 1.8 percent to 5,346, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.4 percent to 16,776.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Historically it's very difficult to achieve a soft landing," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. "It's easy for a soft landing to sneak up on you and become a hard landing. And that's what the market is very much afraid of right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said the market is likely overreacting to a few weak data points, noting that most of the corporate earnings released in the last few weeks have been solid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are ready to shoot first and ask questions later," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Intel shares sank more than 26 percent after the US chip maker announced it would cut more than 15 percent of its workforce while reporting a US$1.6 billion quarterly loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon also had a bad day, losing nearly nine percent on worries about the tech giant's profit outlook after revenues fell short of expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Apple advanced 0.7 percent after reporting quarterly profit of US$21.4 billion, besting analyst forecasts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coca-Cola rose 2.0 percent as it announced plans to pay a tax penalty worth US$6 billion while it pursues an appeal in a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soft drinks giant had previously said the dispute could potentially involve a liability of US$16 billion. (AFP)

 Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei won the men's 10,000 metres gold medal at the Paris Olympics on Friday, the first track medal of the athletics programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time world champion in the 10,000 metres made his move on the final lap and surged in the last 100 metres to cross the finish line in an Olympic record time of 26 minutes, 43.14 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Berihu Aregawi took silver and American Grant Fisher claimed the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Barely 16 years ago when I was watching the great Kenenisa Bekele win in Beijing, it was something that grew in my heart," said Cheptegei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said, 'one day I want to be Olympic champion'. It is the most special day. I can’t describe the feeling. I’ve wanted this for a long time. When I took silver in Tokyo I was so disappointed. I just wanted to win the 10,000m."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, there was an explosive start to the Olympic track and field competition at the Stade de France when the United States mixed 4x400m relay broke the world record to qualify in first place for the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quartet of Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Bryce Deadmon and Kaylyn Brown timed 3 minutes, 7.41 seconds, smashing the previous best of 3:08.80 set when the US won world gold in Budapest last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wanted to come out here and execute good hand-offs," said Norwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We set the tone for the rest of the United States with that world record."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's decathlon, Germany's Leo Neugebauer tops the standings with 4,650 points at the half-way mark, with the second part of the competition to be held the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Dutch long-distance star Sifan Hassan launched her audacious bid for an unprecedented Olympic treble with a confident performance in the opening round of the women's 5,000 metres on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old Olympic champion is aiming to become the first woman in history to win 5,000m, 10,000m and marathon gold at the same Olympics, emulating Czech great Emil Zatopek, who achieved the men's triple at the 1952 Helsinki Games.

 China added a silver and a bronze to their haul in the men's trampoline, while reigning champion Ivan Litvinovich successfully defended his Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Yan Langyu and 18-year-old Wang Zisai were hoping to dethrone Litvinovich, the Belarusian who competed as an "individual neutral athlete" because of his nation's involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, who started third in the eight-man final, briefly led the pack with a score of 61.89 while Yan was close behind in second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were judged by their routine's difficulty, execution, horizontal displacement and time of flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Litvinovich was second last to go, and he withstood pressure to win in 63.09.

 Leon Marchand demonstrated again on Friday why many consider him the best swimmer of his generation as he stormed to his fourth individual gold medal in the pool at La Defense Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French star took command on the backstroke leg of the men's 200m individual medley and never looked back, winning in an Olympic record time of 1 minutes, 54.06 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Duncan Scott won his second straight silver in the event while defending champion Wang Shun of China settled for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand is the first French athlete to take four individual golds, as opposed to team ones, at a single Summer Games and only the third male swimmer to do so after Americans Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's incredible, it was really magical," the 22-year-old told French TV. "The whole stadium was fully behind me and I took advantage of it. It enabled me to win four medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a good night for Australia as the Dolphins came away with two more gold medals from the meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaylee McKeown cemented her place among the greats of Olympic swimming on Friday as she became the first woman to retain both of the backstroke titles with gold in the 200m event in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old world record holder once again overhauled American challenger Regan Smith in a battle royale to claim the win in an Olympic record of 2 minutes, 3.73 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith took silver, 0.53 seconds behind her Australian nemesis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kylie Masse took bronze for Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Australia's Cameron McEvoy took his first Olympic gold medal when he won the men's 50 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Ben Proud took the silver medal, and France's Florent Manaudou the bronze - 12 years after he won gold at London 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel of the United States finished sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McEvoy is the first Australian man to win the shortest distance on the programme. (Reuters)

    Judge suspends Justin Timberlake's NY driver's licence

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Timberlake made a virtual court appearance on Friday in his drunken driving case on Long Island, saying little during the brief proceeding as a judge accepted his not-guilty plea and suspended his right to drive in New York.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police in the seaside village of Sag Harbor arrested Timberlake June 18 after they say he ran a stop sign, veered out of his lane and got out of his BMW smelling of alcohol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former NSYNC singer, who is on tour in Europe, wasn't required by the court to return to the US for his court date. He is performing on Saturday night in Antwerp, Belgium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorney, Edward Burke Jr, has maintained that Timberlake was not drunk and that the case should be dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The facts remain he was not intoxicated,” Burke said on Friday, according to Newsday. “I’ll say it again: Justin Timberlake was not intoxicated and we’re very confident that charge, that criminal charge, will be dismissed.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor Village Justice Carl Irace suspended Timberlake's Tennessee driver's licence in New York state and threatened to impose a gag order on Burke, saying the attorney's comments to the media have been inappropriate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irace set a next court date for August 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake had appeared in court in person previously but his arraignment needed to be repeated because of a paperwork oversight. Burke said the original charging document lacked a police sergeant’s signature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Attorney Ashley Cangro said new documents were filed July 2 to address that flaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was pulled over after leaving a Sag Harbor hotel around 12:30 am, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odour of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardised field sobriety tests,” police said in a court filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake, 43, told the officer he had had one martini and was following some friends home, according to police. He was arrested and spent the night in custody at a police station. (AP)

    Harris secures Democratic presidential nomination

    <![CDATA[<img alt="No other Democrat challenged Kamala Harris for the party's nomination. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764516_1_20240803022813.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris effectively secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination on Friday, confirming her remarkable rise to party standard bearer in November's showdown against Republican Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Harris was the sole candidate on the ballot for a five-day electronic vote of nearly 4,000 party convention delegates. She will be officially crowned at a Chicago convention later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am honoured to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States," Harris, 59, said on a phone-in to a party celebration after securing enough votes by the second day of the marathon vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the two weeks since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Harris has gained full control of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other Democrats stepped forward to challenge her elevation to the top of the ticket, making her confirmation as the first black and south Asian woman ever to secure a major party's nomination a formality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came with Harris preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for a swing across seven crucial battleground states with her newly minted running mate – who is expected to be revealed within days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democratic Party decided on a virtual nomination process – mirroring the pandemic-hit 2020 vote – because of Ohio's August 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The virtual roll call marks the official beginning of the 2024 convention, although in practice the festivities really get going when thousands of party faithful descend on Chicago on August 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will feature ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate in what is expected to be a raucous celebration of her rise from state politics to the top of the ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's White House bid was thrown into chaos on July 21 when Biden, 81, withdrew his candidacy, backing Harris as the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice president has already smashed fundraising records, packed arenas and wiped out Trump's polling leads over Biden, creating momentum that she hopes she can ride through the convention to the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is set to make her first public appearance with her running mate on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state whose Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is among a handful candidates being vetted to potentially join the Harris ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swing will take Harris through all the "blue wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where she will seek to rebuild the coalition that carried Biden to victory in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she will extend the tour to the much more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Georgia, North Carolina Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada as she seeks to shore up the black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats. (AFP)

    Weak jobs data sparks worries about US economy

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data shows US unemployment edging up to 4.3 percent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764508_1_20240803000230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with sustained higher interest rates taking a toll on businesses and consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Friday’s report from the US Labor Department showed that employers added just 114,000 jobs in July – 35 percent fewer than forecasters had expected – and that unemployment, now up to 4.3 percent, was the highest since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news shook financial markets around the world, with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both dropping sharply at the open of trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sturdiness of the US economy — the world’s largest — has been a key driver of global economic growth and the US jobs market is a big reason for it, underpinning the American expansion and giving consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unemployment rate's jump to 4.3 percent in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signalled that the United States is in recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the topsy-turvy post-pandemic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weak jobs report came two days after the Federal Reserve said it would hold off on cutting interest rates until it sees more evidence that inflation is continuing to move down and closer to its 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterised the American job market as healthy, despite growing calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high, to pre-empt a major weakening of the US economy and job market. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mourners and supporters bid farewell on Friday in Qatar to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after his killing in Tehran, blamed on Israel, has heightened regional tensions as the Gaza war dragged on.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of people gathered at the Gulf emirate's largest mosque, where Haniyeh's casket, draped in a Palestinian flag, was taken before leaving again for burial in Lusail, north of Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh, the Palestinian armed group's political chief, played a key role in mediated talks aimed at ending nearly 10 months of war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His killing triggered calls for revenge and raised questions about the continued viability of such negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mourners lined up for funeral prayers inside Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Mosque, while others prayed on mats outside in temperatures that reached 44 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony ended in angry chants, but the short-lived demonstration quickly dispersed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was a symbol, a resistance leader... people are angry," said Taher Adel, 25, a Jordanian student residing in the Qatari capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's predecessor Khaled Meshaal spoke at the ceremony, saying the slain leader had "served his cause, his people... and never abandoned them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday to honour Haniyeh, while Hamas called for a "day of furious rage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan were among the officials at the funeral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ismail Hanyieh is a symbol for all Muslims," said Qatari Ahmed Mahmoud, 48, at the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There must be a reaction. Israel must know we will defend ourselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the president of the United Arab Emirates, said his country – which in 2020 normalised ties with Israel – rejects "violence and political assassination in all its forms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Doha mourners wore scarves that combined the Palestinian flag with a checkered keffiyeh pattern and the message in English: "Free Palestine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on their accommodation in Tehran on Wednesday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said. Haniyeh was in Iran to attend the swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing of Qatar-based Haniyeh is among several incidents since April that have sent regional tensions soaring during the Gaza war, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian officials met with representatives of these groups on Wednesday to discuss the next steps, said a source close to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting and requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met with his visiting British counterpart John Healey on Friday and stressed "the importance of establishing a coalition" to support "Israel's defence against Iran and its proxies," Gallant's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France urged its nationals visiting Iran to leave "due to the increased risk of a military escalation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Gaza war, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire, and did so again on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, the civil defence agency reported several people killed in the territory's north, and Israel's military said it had killed around 30 militants near Rafah, in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's assassination came hours after Israel struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Lebanese Hamas ally Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's deputy, Saleh al-Aruri, was killed in Beirut early this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another high-profile killing, Israel's army on Thursday confirmed that an air strike in July killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "delivered crushing blows to all our enemies," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh in Tehran, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times, citing Middle Eastern officials, has reported that Haniyeh was killed by an explosive device planted weeks ago at a Tehran guesthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the report, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists "there was no other Israeli aerial attack... in all the Middle East" on the night of Shukr's killing in Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said Shukr's assassination – for which Hezbollah said retaliation was "inevitable" – was a response to rocket fire which killed 12 youths last week in the annexed Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian news agency Fars said the US report was a "lie," insisting that the Hamas leader was killed by a "projectile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analyst Hugh Lovatt said Haniyeh's killing at the very least "will mean that a ceasefire deal with Israel is now totally off of the table."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu by telephone on Thursday and affirmed his commitment to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the basis for a ceasefire (in Gaza)... They should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong smashed their way to a gold medal in the mixed doubles badminton event on Friday at the Paris Olympics, beating Kim Won-ho and Jeong Na-eun of South Korea in straight sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Japanese pair of Yuta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino won the bronze medal match to complete the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After receiving her medal on the podium, Huang's boyfriend and fellow Chinese shuttler Liu Yuchen proposed to her in front of an ecstatic crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang made a commanding start with a strong attack to put them far ahead. Kim and Jeong tried their best to defend, but could not overcome the world number one duo in the first game 21-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans stepped up their efforts with more attacks in the beginning of the second game, knowing this would determine their position on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese side’s tactic to target one specific player at a time immediately put them back in the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair's powerful smash shots further widened the gap to end the game 21-11 and earn a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang lost to their Chinese counterparts at the Tokyo Olympics in the gold medal match, but this time around they were able to reach the top of the podium in just under an hour of game play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cap off her already special day, Huang's boyfriend Liu made a surprise appearance at the arena. He came prepared with an engagement ring, and presented it to Huang while on one knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will love you for my whole life. Will you marry me?" Liu asked in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overcome with joy, Huang said 'yes'.

 The double world champion from Chinese Taipei, Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the heart of a gender row, won her featherweight round of 16 bout against Uzbekistan's Sidora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision at the Paris Olympics on Friday.

  The 28-year-old Lin, along with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won her round of 16 welterweight fight on Thursday against Italy's Angela Carini in 46 seconds, have been in the spotlight of the gender row after being cleared to compete in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women's events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing tournament in Paris, has cleared the boxers to compete in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IBA said in a statement the athletes "did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the "specifics" of this test "remain confidential", the IBA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the Olympic body's eligibility criteria was based on the gender indicated on the boxers' passports, but acknowledged that it's "not a black and white issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Lin nor Khelif is known to identify as transgender and both competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in the women's competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The row has expanded outside the ring, with politicians and celebrities weighing in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Khelif-Carini fight was "not on an equal footing", after the Italian fighter was left with a badly hurt nose and in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US presidential candidate Donald Trump declared on his Truth Social network that he would keep "men out of women's sports".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate JD Vance described Thursday's one-sided bout between Khelif-Carini as a "grown man pummelling a woman in a boxing match", adding: "This is disgusting, and all of our leaders should condemn it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Potter author JK Rowling said on X, formerly Twitter, that the Paris Games would be "forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday maintained a steady position in the pack after two more races in the men's dinghy event, with six still to come over the next three days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ranked 28th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 65 net points, compared with 32 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz became the youngest man to reach the Olympic Games men's tennis final on Friday when he thrashed Felix Auger-Aliassime.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, 21, swept to a 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Canadian in just 75 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an objective since the start of the year to try and win the gold medal and now we have one match left to try and get it done," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to have fun in the final and do the business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish star, playing on the same Roland Garros court where he won the French Open in June, broke the 19th-ranked Auger-Aliassime three times in the first set, racing away with six consecutive games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz broke again in the fourth and sixth games of the second set on his way to claiming a fourth successive win over the Canadian having lost the first three of the pair's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very complete performance and I played at a very high level from start to finish," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had very good feelings and sensations, I'm so happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The final is very important for me and the Spanish people but I try not to think about how important it is and will focus on the match," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wimbledon champion Alcaraz is the third Spanish man to reach the Olympic men's final after Jordi Arrese at Barcelona in 1992, Sergi Bruguera in Atlanta four years later and Rafael Nadal who won gold at Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now has the chance to become the youngest men's champion since tennis returned to the Olympics at Seoul in 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz will face Novak Djokovic who reached his first Olympic final in what should be a dream showdown for gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top seed Djokovic, still seeking an elusive Olympic title to sit along his 24 Grand Slams, defeated Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2 in a nail-biting semi-final during which he was handed a code violation for swearing at the chair umpire. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said there were about 160,000 technology crime cases in the first half of the year, a 3.5 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said the total loss incurred in the cases amounted to HK$2.66 billion, and that they noted a surge in the use of blackmail apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Raymond Lam of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said tech crime in Hong Kong is on the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said though hacker groups are operating in the city, most cases involved overseas groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested that companies should be proactive when it comes to updating their devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of systems which the users do not update on time. If software and hardware are not updated on time, it will have a lot of loopholes. Therefore systems should be updated on time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Policy Office, meanwhile, said it checks government systems regularly, and it has not discovered loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Assistant Commissioner Daniel Cheung said they conduct spot checks, and any loopholes will be plugged immediately if any are found.

 Wang Zongyuan and Long Daoyi won the men's synchronised 3-metre springboard event at the Paris Olympics on Friday to claim the nation's fourth gold in diving.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both second-time Olympians, the pair finished on 446.10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, previously won gold in the same event in Tokyo three years ago with Xie Siyi, who is only competing in the individual event as defending champion in this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo trailed after the fourth of six dives, but they rallied on the final two dives to take China's fourth straight gold medal and stay on track for an unprecedented sweep of all eight diving events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long and Wang held off the Mexican team of Juan Celaya and Osmar Olvera with 444.03.

  Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding of Britain took bronze with a score of 438.15. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Friday fought hard for the best rank he could get in the men’s single sculls at the Paris Olympic Games, despite dropping out of contention for a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu began in the second lane of the final group D race, where he was competing for the 19th to 24th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started off second in the first 500 metres, before pulling himself to the front of the pack in the next 1,000 metres. But Quentin Antognelli of Monaco came from behind to overtake Chiu in the end with a time of 6 minutes and 54.93 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we were unable to get a medal, I hope this serves as motivation and inspiration for younger rowers," Chiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want them to fight hard for their dreams and dream big, and we can have higher and faster results in future international events,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who finished second out of six in his race with a time of 6 minutes and 56.65 seconds, ranked 20th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He previously competed in the Rio Olympic Games, where he finished 19th in the lightweight double sculls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Table tennis powerhouse China on Friday secured places in both singles finals at the Paris Olympics, after Fan Zhendong made it through on the men's side while Chen Meng and  Sun Yingsha set up an all-China final in the women's competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, the second seed on the men's side, crushed local favourite Felix Lebrun 4-0 in a little more than half an hour in the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan won 11-8, 11-6, 11-7 and 11-5 to silence the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became China's only medal hopeful in the men's singles after top-seeded Wang Chuqin was stunned by Sweden's Truls Moregard in an earlier round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-seeded Lebrun, who's only 17, did manage a three-point lead in the third game, but was otherwise outclassed by Fan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will face Moregard in the final, after the Swede defeated Brazil's Hugo Calderano 4-2 in a gruelling semi-final matchup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chen has a chance to retain her Olympic singles title, after an emphatic 4-0 trouncing of South Korea's Shin Yubin in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Sun Yingsha, also from China, secured another all-China final after brushing aside Japan's Hina Hayata 4-0 in the other semi-final tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun won 11-6, 11-8, 11-8, 11-2, while not allowing the Japanese to take a lead in the last two games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed his six-day trip to Southeast Asia for allowing him to "meet new friends and strength past relationships", with a total of 55 non-binding deals signed with three countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "[We signed] twelve with Laos, 13 with Cambodia and 30 with Vietnam, covering a wide range of cooperative areas, such as trade and economic partnership, investment, customs collaboration, education, cultural exchanges and tourism promotion," he told reporters in Ho Chi Minh City on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have confirmed the support from the three countries' governments for Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an earlier luncheon with business leaders, Lee pledged to strengthen ties with Asean countries and reiterated his wish for Hong Kong to join the free trade pact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is making good use of the free trade agreement and investment agreement between Asean and Hong Kong to deepen our collaboration with Vietnam and other Asean countries. And we are eager to go beyond those free trade agreements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope, too, to join RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Through RCEP, I'm confident Hong Kong can make an even bigger contribution to the overall economic growth of Vietnam, Asean and the larger Asian region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Vietnamese politicians on his last day, including the chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Phan Van Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other visits included a trip to a Hong Kong-owned garment manufacturing factory, where the firm's chief executive officer was quoted as saying the company will continue to keep its headquarters in the SAR and attract talent from Asean countries to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR delegation was returning to Hong Kong on Friday evening.

<div class="itemFullText">
 It will be a guaranteed gold and silver for the national team as two Chinese pairs advanced to the final in the women’s doubles badminton event on Friday at La Chapelle Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first semi-final match, the pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan beat their Malaysian counterparts 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number one duo easily took the first game, 21-12, against Pearly Tan and Muralitharan Thinaah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Malaysians fought back 21-18 in the second, the first game the Chinese duo dropped in five matches throughout the tournament in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia then repeatedly targeted Tan, winning one point by directing multiple smashes at the Malaysian who managed a couple of acrobatic saves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese eventually prevailed and took the final game, 21-15, to book their place in the final. The two had won silver medals at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other match, Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning won in straight sets, after defeating Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida of Japan 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides fought aggressively in game one. The points were fairly equal until the national team pulled ahead to take it 21-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though the Japanese team managed to win a few points in the first half of the second game, the Chinese pair were able to widen the gap, ultimately winning 21-19.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Brands and Products Shopping Festival features more than 250 stalls and is expected to attract 60,000 visitors. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764428_1_20240802161229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day annual shopping festival kicked off on Friday at AsiaWorld-Expo, with organisers offering free admission to bargain hunters on opening day in celebration of Hong Kong's success at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, visitors and exhibitors at the Brands and Products Shopping Festival, organised by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, pointed to smaller crowds than usual at the fair that runs until August 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, featuring over 250 stalls, was expected to attract 60,000 visitors and generate some HK$60 million in sales revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ivan Sze, the association's vice-president, said he's not worried that sales would be affected by Hongkongers heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists being raised, we hope more mainland visitors will come to the festival to spend," Sze said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For Hongkongers heading north, dining accounts for a large proportion of their spending. But they may not buy too much across the border, because such consumption depends on the products themselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vendor surnamed Ng was selling sparkling wine at the fair and said there were several mainland tour groups visiting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were around 20 to 30 percent of visitors from the mainland. And with organisers offering free admissions, the number of people coming on the first day was about 20 to 30 percent more than last year's opening day," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would already be great for sales this year to match the previous year's levels... I hope the government can introduce more new promotional deals, or stimulate the retail sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor from the Netherlands, who gave his name as Hugo, said he did not see a lot of overseas visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy with the people who are there, but I hope there are more people in the weekend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Macau resident surnamed Lau came to Hong Kong just for the festival and spent around HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere was quite nice, and people were very friendly. The vendors were fair when doing business, and they were courteous," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tseung Kwan O resident surnamed Cheung said it took her two hours to travel from home to the event venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I did not have a voucher [for the festival], I might not have come... It seemed to have few people here. It's only the first day and there were only a handful of people," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An advocacy group on Friday called for more government support for people raising children with special educational needs (SEN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People Service Centre said a survey it carried out involving the caregivers of 175 children with special educational needs found almost 65 percent would like to be able to work, while 80 percent said existing employment support on offer was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social worker Zoe Lam said mothers caring for such children can find their responsibilities overwhelming, while a lack of flexibility in the workplace prevents them from getting a job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “One of our SEN caregivers, she tried to find [childcare] services but she experienced being rejected a number of times because her son was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia,” said Lam
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to 10 percent of the survey respondents said they had been denied childcare services because of their child's emotional or behavioural condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advocacy group called for more family-friendly employment policies, employment subsidies, employer incentives and the improvement of SEN childcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want these four recommendations to be put in the 2024 Policy Address, because now caregivers do not have the choice to choose between personal development and taking care of their families," Lam said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ada Chung says people should be wary of sharing photos and videos of themselves too widely due to a rise in deepfake scams. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764388_1_20240802111958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers should avoid sharing photos or videos of themselves too widely to reduce the risk of scammers hijacking their images, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Chung said fraudsters are using technology to create deepfake images and videos to trick people into handing over money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong employees of two multinational companies have fallen victim to such scams this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If people really like sharing photos and videos of themselves, they should only share it with a specific audience group or privately. This will already make it much safer. They do not have to share it publicly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said her office received around 600 enquiries relating to fraud in the first six months of the year, up nearly 90 percent on the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said most involved phone scams, including cases where callers impersonated employees of various organisations to try to get people to give away personal information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencer Edgar Cheung returned to a hero's welcome from the Paris Games on Friday saying he still can't believe he managed to become the first athlete in decades to defend a men's foil title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who's also the first-ever SAR competitor to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals, was greeted by a crowd of fans as he arrived at the airport
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Never give up trying our best to give everything... because for me, it's what I train for, for the Olympics and every day I train hard to be in a good condition to fence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said his only regret from the Games was that the men’s foil team didn't qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said every SAR athlete gives their very best and they deserve respect regardless of whether they win a medal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he's going to have a big holiday before getting back to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We prepared for the Olympics for the past three years. It was hard, it was tough and physically, mentally, I'm quite tired. So for me now, I just want to have a good rest and to prepare for the next season,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having spent a lot of time in France, Cheung said he was craving Hong Kong cuisine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he had no plans yet on what to do with his HK$6 million prize money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on Italy's complaint and suggestions of bias over his victory against Filippo Macchi, Cheung said referees always follow fencing rules, even if they sometimes have different interpretations. He added that the referees in Paris were all professional and experienced.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index on Friday was down about 1.4 percent, or 240 points, in early trading at 17,064.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off came after Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday following weak manufacturing data, sparking worries about a US recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, European stocks had slumped on disappointing bank earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US indices finished decisively lower, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index falling the most at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets will get another key US economic data point on Friday with monthly jobs data. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For any Olympian, there's no shame in losing to the world's best player. There's even less shame when that player wasn't even born when you first competed at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But that's exactly the situation that 61-year-old table tennis player Ni Xialian found herself in in the women's singles in Paris. The Shanghai native, who represents her adopted country of Luxembourg, has been winning hearts as she proves that age is but a number ... even when it comes to playing a sport at the very highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni wrote herself into Olympic history as the oldest competitor to win a table tennis match when she beat Sibel Altinkaya of Turkey 4-2 in the round of 64 in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni, who won a mixed doubles world championship for China in her youth before moving to Europe, said she has already reached her goal of being able to compete at the Olympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Olympics has its own difficulties, but every time is exciting and a wonderful experience. For the technique part of the game, it depends on the draw," she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important. If you have some difficult draw, it's difficult. But of course, my age, you cannot against the nature. Every year getting more difficult, that's a fact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni's Olympic journey ended on Wednesday after being edged out by world number one Sun Yingsha of China, who is 38 years younger than her. Sun was born just a couple of months after Ni's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy to have this opportunity and not every day have such a chance, she's number one and people say I'm the only one, so I think it's a very happy, interesting game and we are showing Chinese table tennis [to] the world," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's such a strong, different generation and different area, and I hope I can offer a wonderful game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though Ni has completed her Olympic journey - at least until 2028 - she has won the hearts of many fans for her youthful spirit, becoming a social media hit after her inspiring performance at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people expressed their respect for her performance, while many others commented on the athlete's cuteness when she deployed spin to return her opponent’s shots.

 No medals for Hong Kong, China on Day 6 of the Olympic Games in Paris, although the SAR's athletes saw action in the pool and on the waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were more golds to celebrate for China in men's shooting and women's athletics, plus an historic result for Zheng Qinwen who beat the world number one to reach the women's Olympic tennis final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of the day, China top the medals table with 11 golds, with the US in second place. Hong Kong are now ranked 14th with two gold and two bronze medals.

  Here's what happened.

   Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the women's event, Ma fell two places to finish 14th overall and was also out of the competition.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kate Douglass underlined her remarkable versatility with gold in the women's 200 metres breaststroke at the Paris Olympics on Thursday, beating Tokyo champion Tatjana Smith who bows out of a stellar swimming career with a silver medal in her final race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking full advantage of her turning prowess, American Douglass nudged ahead of Smith after every length and held off the South African to touch the wall in 2:19.24 at La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really excited. I feel like for a while I wasn't sure if Olympic champion was going to be possible for me to say, and now it's just really exciting to see it happen," Douglas told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Tes Schouten won bronze for the Netherlands, her first Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's finals, Hubert Kos took Hungary's first swimming gold of the Paris Olympics when he won the men's 200 metres backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Apostolos Christou took the silver and Switzerland's Roman Mityukov the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia rounded out the evening with victory in the women's 4x200 metres relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holders didn't have it all their own way though, as they were pushed hard in the first three legs by the US and defending champions China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, world record holder Ariarne Titmus anchored the Aussies to an Olympic-record winning gold while the US took silver and China the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US silver meant also that Katie Ledecky became the most decorated female swimmer of all time with 13 Olympic medals. (Agencies)

    Wall Street ends down on jitters over manufacturing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street initially opened stronger, but changed direction after manufacturing data raised concerns about the economy. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764341_1_20240802042650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks kicked off August sharply lower after a round of economic data on Thursday spurred concerns the economy may be slowing faster than anticipated while the Federal Reserve maintains a restrictive monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities initially opened higher, partly lifted by Meta Platforms after its quarterly results topped expectations and the Facebook parent issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the early gains evaporated after data showed a measure of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) dropped to an eight-month low in July at 46.8, signifying contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What you’re seeing now, and you will probably see it for the next month or two, is some kind of consolidation and sideways price action," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bigger picture bull trend is intact ... But we're in a period now where the market is kind of digesting its gains sideways, back and forth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 lost 75.62 points, or 1.4 percent, to end at 5,446.68, the Nasdaq Composite lost 405.26 points, or 2 .3 percent, to 17,194.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 494.82 points, or 1.2 percent, to 40,347.97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  August is typically one of the weakest months of the year for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other data showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labour market, although seasonal factors also played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will eye government payroll data later on Friday for signs of further weakness in the labour market. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Yufei came up short in her title defence of the 200m butterfly, coming back third while relinquishing her Olympic record to eventual champion Summer McIntosh of Canada.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang, who earlier took bronze in the 100m butterfly, was in the chase at the halfway mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But McIntosh powered into a decisive lead by the final turn of the pool, while American Regan Smith also caught up with Zhang down the stretch to clinch silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh touched the wall after two minutes and 3.03 seconds, smashing the previous record set in Tokyo by more than eight-tenths of a second. Zhang came back over two seconds later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Jiangsu native has one more shot at gold in the 50m freestyle, which starts on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday evening, China added a bronze in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Junxuan and Li Bingjie, who were part of the quartet who struck gold in Tokyo, were joined by Ge Chutong and Liu Yaxin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finished at just over seven minutes and 42 seconds, around four seconds behind winners Australia, while the United States took silver.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong scraped through to the men's singles semi-final after a pulsating contest against Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who bagged silver in Tokyo, erased a two-game deficit before outlasting his opponent 4-3 in 68 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was a major relief for Chinese fans, after top seed Wang Chuqin suffered a shock exit in the round of 32 yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan's defeat would be a huge disappointment for China, as they have finished on the podium of the men's singles in every Games since 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I didn't perform particularly well today, and allowed my opponent to dictate the rhythm," Fan told RTHK after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to break through, and kept my confidence. Eventually I found a way while keeping the score close, and waited for the momentum to shift."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will next take on 17-year-old French prodigy Felix Lebrun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Sun Yingsha reached the last four in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed has not dropped a single game so far in Paris, going 16-0 following her latest victory over Chinese Taipei's Cheng I-ching in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, who already bagged a gold in the mixed doubles, will next face Hina Hayata of Japan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles clinched her sixth Olympic gold medal in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Paris Games on Thursday, reasserting her status as the number one all-around gymnast three years after she withdrew from the same final at the Tokyo Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight race between Biles and Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, the American was surprisingly left trailing in third place after a flawed performance on the uneven bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she was back on top after a solid performance on her next apparatus - the balance beam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she waited to perform last on the floor, she knew the gold would be hers if she avoided any unexpected slip ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She executed an electrifying routine to secure the gold with a total of 59.131 points, just 1.199 points ahead of her Brazilian rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrade earned a second successive silver in the competition where each gymnasts needs to show off their skills on all four women's apparatus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles' teammate Sunisa Lee, the Tokyo all-around champion, fought back from a disappointing start on the vault to claim thee bronze with 56.465 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles captured her second gold medal of the Paris Games, and her second all-around Olympic title after also winning the individual event in Rio in 2016. She also claimed the team gold earlier this week. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate for the first time since the pandemic broke out in 2020, as British inflation has retreated in recent months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight 5-4 vote, BoE policymakers agreed to reduce borrowing costs by a quarter-point to 5.0 percent, the central bank announced following a regular meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Andrew Bailey joined four other policymakers in bringing the rate down from a 16-year high, which will ease pressure on borrowers while denting interest earned by savers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail banks tend to mirror the direction of BoE policy when setting their own interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inflationary pressures have eased enough that we've been able to cut interest rates," Bailey said in a short statement. "But we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's annual inflation rate has returned to the BoE target of two percent, after soaring to a four-decade high above 11 percent in late 2022.

  <br/>
  The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its key lending rate unchanged, but noted "some further progress" had been made in bringing inflation down. It is expected to cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the BoE's action Thursday, analysts said they expected the British central bank to cut again this year, but maybe not as early as next month. That helped the pound claw back earlier losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, the European Central Bank has started to trim rates as gains to prices of global goods and services have largely slowed in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday hiked borrowing costs for only the second time in 17 years amid a pickup in the country's inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's rate cut comes less than one month after the country elected a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour administration has vowed to grow the UK economy but has already warned that state spending will be hampered by tight finances. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese weather authorities said July was the country's hottest month since records began, state media said on Thursday, as extreme temperatures persist across large parts of the globe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last month was "the hottest July since complete observations began in 1961, and the hottest single month in the history of observation", state broadcaster CCTV said, citing weather authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average air temperature in China last month was 23.21 degrees Celsius (73.78 degrees Fahrenheit), exceeding the previous record of 23.17 C in 2017, CCTV reported the weather authorities as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mean temperature in every province was also "higher than the average for previous years", with the southwestern provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan logging their highest ever averages, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has experienced by extreme weather this summer, with heat waves scorching parts of the north while torrential rains have triggered floods and landslides in central and southern areas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma have both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng entered the day ranked ninth overall out of 24 men's entrants, having won a race yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two remaining races were scrapped, meaning the 24-year-old had no chance to make up lost ground. Only the top 10 surfers would reach the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma, on the other hand, fell two places to finish 14th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was disqualified on the first race on Thursday, and placed 15th and 10th in the ensuing two. Like the men's competition, the two final women's races were cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday has a lot of catching up to do after the opening day of dinghy competition in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Olympic debutante is placed 28th out of 43 after two races, with eight still to come over the coming four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner for each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday is now on 49 points, compared with 27 for Jean-Baptiste Bernaz of France in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy's Lorenzo Musetti knocked defending champion Alexander Zverev out of the Olympic Games tennis tournament on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Musetti triumphed 7-5, 7-5 over the German world number four in the quarter-finals and will face either top seed Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz of Spain stormed into the semi-finals with an imperious display of tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, playing on the same Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros where he captured the French Open in June, saw off 13th-ranked Tommy Paul of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz recovered from a break down in the second set to defeat Paul, having also beaten the American in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on his way to the title at the All England Club last month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan are expected to be released by Russia as part of one of the biggest East-West prisoner swaps since the Cold War, according to US media on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CNN and other US networks reported the news, with ABC News reporting that the swap involved numerous countries and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate confirmation from US officials. The Kremlin declined to comment on any exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still have no comment on this topic," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March 2023 and convicted in July on spying charges in a fast-track trial denounced as a sham by the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of an imminent prisoner swap had picked up momentum on Thursday, amid reports a plane used in a previous exchange deal had landed in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopes had also risen in recent days days after a number of high-profile prisoners in Russia, including Whelan, went missing from prisons where they were serving long terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those expected to be returned to Russia in exchange is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian citizen imprisoned in Germany for killing a former Chechen rebel commander in a brazen assassination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exchange would be a victory for US President Joe Biden, whose vice president, Kamala Harris, faces Republican Donald Trump in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would be the first prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since star US basketball player Brittney Griner was swapped in return for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen of China stunned women's world number one Iga Swiatek on Thursday to become the first player from the nation to reach an Olympic Games tennis singles final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventh-ranked Zheng triumphed 6-2, 7-5 and will face either Croatia's Donna Vekic or Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel more than just happy – happy isn't enough to describe how I feel," said Zheng, who had played back-to-back three-hour matches to make the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you ask me to play another three hours for my country, I would. It was an amazing match. To beat Iga is not easy, as it's an important event for her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion at Roland Garros, went into Thursday's match at a sweltering Court Philippe Chatrier on a 25-match win streak in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old had defeated Zheng in all of their six previous meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the mixed doubles, the Chinese pair of Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen reached the final after defeating their opponents from the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Zhang were slow off the block in the semi-final, conceding the opening set 2-6 to Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese pair levelled the match at one set apiece by winning set two 6-4, before clinching the tie-break 10-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will face the winner of the other semi-final between the pairs from Canada and the Czech Republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final is scheduled on Saturday morning, Hong Kong time at Roland Garros. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department on Thursday said it conducted around 6,900 checks at about 700 old residential and commercial buildings as of the end of last month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said inspections were stepped up after a fatal fire in a Jordan residential block in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Fire Officer Michael Yung said the common hazards identified during the inspections included defective smoke-stop doors and obstructed escape routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the department will take legal action against those who ignore warning notices and fail to carry out improvement works.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For these inspections, we have issued about [5,000] fire hazard abatement notices, and we will likely take legal action against 264 offences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung added the department aims to inspect 1,000 high-risk old buildings by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the department prosecuted over 1,000 cases for non-compliance to fire safety directions in the first half of the year, a threefold increase compared to the previous year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Hong Kong swimmers on Thursday failed to make it out of the heats at Paris La Defense Arena, bringing their Olympic journeys to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cindy Cheung, the youngest member to represent the SAR in swimming, competed in the women’s 200m backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old maintained a steady pace in her heat against two others, finishing in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She clocked 2 minutes 17.32 seconds, more than 4 seconds behind the winner Tatiana Salcutan of Moldova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who came 26th overall among 27 swimmers, said she was not happy with her performance but that her experience in Paris had been invaluable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the end, this was a very good learning experience. I got to see how the Olympic Village was like, and experienced what it was like to compete at such a high level – the feeling is very different," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though my finishing time was not up to my expectations, this was an experience that's hard to come by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men’s side, Ian Ho also concluded his second Olympics in the pool after he failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the men’s 50m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old came last in his heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really can’t complain. It’s been a good Olympics for me, and to have such a different experience from last time...Really, I’m grateful for what I’ve been able to do," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and Ho were eliminated from the women’s 100m backstroke and the men’s 100m freestyle earlier.

 Retail sales fell 9.7 percent to HK$29.9 billion in June, government data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, total retail sales were down 6.6 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman attributed the decline to changing consumer behaviour among both visitors and residents, as well as the strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said the rate of decline narrowed further in June, signalling a stabilisation in retail activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the spokesman pointed to ongoing challenges for the sector in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said central government initiatives benefiting Hong Kong and the SAR government's efforts to support the retail sector through mega-events would help retailers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An alert that warns people using the Faster Payment System (FPS) they could be about to lose money to fraudsters is being extended to transactions made in banks or via online banking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From August 4, bank customers will receive an alert if they are on the verge of making a transfer to a recipient flagged as high-risk by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Chu, executive director in banking supervision at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said the extended alert system will offer people more protection from scammers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After this expansion, the coverage of bank transfer transactions will increase from 35 percent to 84 percent. It basically has a wide coverage of the fund transfer transactions, and it will enhance the protection to customers to send the high-risk alerts to them to warn them before they execute a transaction," Chu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Lam from the police's Cyber Security and Technology Bureau said the fraud alert system has been effective since its launch in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of the end of June this year, our system has issued more than 650,000 high-risk alerts. That is an average of one warning for every 30 seconds, which is effectively reminding people of the risk of a scam," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Projected from the average loss of about HK$1,500 per each scam case, and we anticipate the high-risk alert has so far issued a warning of scams [involving] nearly HK$1 billion."
