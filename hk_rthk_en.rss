<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain on Wednesday paid tribute to those who took part in D-Day, promising to "always remember" the sacrifices made by the Allied soldiers who invaded France by sea and air to drive out the forces of Nazi Germany in the World War II operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With guests waving British flags, appearances from veterans, recollections and readings - and some tears in Queen Camilla's eyes - the British ceremony took place in Portsmouth, the main departure point for the 5,000 ships that headed to Normandy on June 6, 1944.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we come together to honour those nearly 160,000 British, Commonwealth and Allied troops who, on 5th June 1944, assembled here and along these shores to embark on the mission which would strike that blow for freedom and be recorded as the greatest amphibious operation in history," King Charles said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, as we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory, whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us, once again, commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day and to live up to the freedom they died for."
  <br/>

    New teaching kit to help autistic teens make friends

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two social welfare groups on Wednesday introduced a new teaching kit to help teenagers with autism make friends, saying they often find it hard to fit in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Family Planning Association and Wai Ji Christian Service worked together to design games and story cards that teach autistic teens to interact with others in different social scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Fung, a clinical psychologist with the Christian group, said autistic children struggle to read other people’s emotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Their main difficulty is they don't really recognise the facial expression or the reaction from others. Therefore, they might have a lot of difficulties recognising their reaction and coming up with an appropriate response to them,” she said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, said the teaching kit helps them understand what's expected in social situations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With these stories shown to them, they can actually say, 'Oh, this is what people expected, this is what's going wrong.' So they can learn from seeing. They can learn from understanding,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published by the Census and Statistics Department showed that 22,400 people are living with autism in Hong Kong as of 2020, making up 0.3 percent of the total population.

    Subpar taxi fleets could be banned: authorities

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government hopes new taxi fleets will drive up service quality. File photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756208_1_20240605164135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fleets set to hit the streets of Hong Kong could be suspended from doing business if their service quality isn't up to scratch, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department is currently vetting 15 applications for taxi fleet licences, with up to five successful bidders expected to be announced in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to questions from lawmaker Edward Leung, Acting Transport Secretary Liu Chun-san said taxi fleet operators will need to take part in a mid-term appraisal and their performance would be taken into account should they wish to renew their licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport commissioner would be able to initiate an inquiry should a fleet fail to meet the required standards and a number of sanctions would be available, such as a licence suspension or withdrawing certain taxis from the fleet, Liu said in a written reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year saw a 75 percent surge in complaints against taxi drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of the 1,006 cases filed to the authorities were related to drivers refusing hire, while another 340 cabbies were accused of overcharging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But authorities cautioned that the jump in complaints came against a low base of comparison in 2022, when Hong Kong was still curtailed by Covid restrictions.

 Hong Kong stocks closed in negative territory on Wednesday as US data showing a bigger-than-expected drop in job openings was offset by growing worries about the outlook for the world's top economy.

    Five arrested over suspected fake drugs, cosmetics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Wednesday said they had arrested five people on suspicion of selling counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetic products in Mong Kok worth around HK$620,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were suspected to have violated the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested were three men and two women aged between 28 and 90.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An investigator from the Customs and Excise Department, Kenny Chan, said that salespersons, working for a supplier, brought the goods to retailers to sell at low prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspected counterfeit items were found in an operation on Tuesday, when officers searched three retail outlets in Mong Kok and a warehouse in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said it was difficult for customers to tell the difference between genuine and counterfeit goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he noted that while the packaging and bottles of the suspected counterfeits looked real enough, some of the anti-counterfeiting features were not done in a detailed manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you compare the real goods to the counterfeit ones, the pattern at the bottom of the bottles is different. It's smooth for the genuine goods and relatively rough for the fakes," Chan said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can also see that the trademarks printed on the genuine goods are clear whereas for the counterfeits they are not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan believed that some of the counterfeit goods had already been sold on the market, but officers had not received any complaints from the public so far, such as the products causing skin rashes or other more serious issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said samples of the goods would be sent to the government laboratory for tests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tourism project involving the use of augmented reality (AR) technology has been expanded to Lei Yue Mun, allowing people to learn more about the cultural and historical development of the area famous for its seafood.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Visitors can use a mobile app to scan AR markers at six locations along the harbourfront to see a panorama mixing photos from the past and drawings of what the surroundings looked like from the 1920s to the 1970s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Narrative texts describe the changes to iconic landmarks, such the Tin Hau Temple, Sam Ka Tsuen and the past quarry zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "City in Time" project was launched by the Tourism Commission in 2021, with the initial phase featuring popular tourist spots like Central, The Peak and Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Project manager Yip Tsz-lam said the programme has now been extended to other communities rich in culture or history, such as Lei Yue Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most people know Lei Yue Mun as a seafood paradise, but through our research, we discovered that there are many other interesting historical values in Lei Yue Mun, like the quarrying history, the Hakka culture and also the Tin Hau Temple,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about the panoramic artwork. Visitors can also gain in-depth understanding through the historical narratives and also the old photos.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said it took the research team half a year to gather about 300 old photos to recreate a realistic scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are not many old photos available from universities or any other sources. We rely on the descriptions from villagers and they also provided us with a lot of photos from their family albums,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we're very grateful that a restaurant owner provided us with a photo of him and his father in the 1970s. We provided that photo to the artist and the artist drew them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip added that the programme will later be expanded to Tai Hang and Kowloon City.

    Courtesy ambassadors to improve taxi relations
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Courtesy ambassadors will be stationed at some of the SAR's busiest taxi stands. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756179_2_20240605140015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Taxi Council on Wednesday said that courtesy ambassadors would be stationed at some of the SAR's busiest taxi stands, including at checkpoints and the airport, from June 6 to August 27, to distribute leaflets and souvenirs to passengers and drivers to encourage better service.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The exercise is part of this year's annual taxi courtesy campaign in conjunction with the Tourism Board's hospitality campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, the Taxi Council's chairman Ryan Wong said he hopes this new measure could improve the image of taxi drivers, and also improve communication between drivers and passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have hired university students to be our courtesy ambassadors. Our council has provided them with some training so that they understand the purpose of our campaign and also the services they will provide," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, in addition to our courtesy ambassadors, members of the council will also be on site. If there are questions that the students cannot answer, like industry-related questions, our members can help can help out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick added that service would also be enhanced with more taxis incorporating electronic payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that there are several systems that are available and [are being] installed in the taxi fleets now," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By the introduction of the taxi fleet management scheme by the government, they are required to put this electronic payment system in there, so I'm sure that the situation will start to improve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who RTHK spoke to said that taxi services have improved over the years, but there are other aspects that could make journeys more enjoyable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daria, who takes a taxi two to three times a week, said a lot of old taxis have been replaced with more comfortable and newer vehicles, but said it is difficult to hail a cab, especially during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe have a better app, but right now, it doesn't work properly so for me, I cannot really order a taxi. The taxi drivers never pick up my order, so if they can [provide] more digital [options] to find taxis faster, it would be great," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, I've never experienced any rude behaviour to be honest, but also I know on the news, there are a few accidents involved where taxi drivers are quite old. I think authorities should limit the age as well because it might be dangerous for both the passenger and for the taxi driver."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krauchi, who takes a taxi to work every day, said it would be better if cabs accepted electronic payments, especially with rival Uber being cashless.

    Tickets for overnight trains to mainland go on sale

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for new overnight high-speed trains to the mainland went on sale on Wednesday, with the first service to Beijing selling out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains to the capital and Shanghai will run Friday-Monday from June 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queues for tickets formed at West Kowloon Station, while mainland app 12306 showed no places left for the first train to Beijing, although people could join a wait list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were really happy when we saw the news [regarding the new services], so we immediately decided to travel to Shanghai," a woman told RTHK at West Kowloon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The journey time was 19 hours before, and it's only 11 hours now. The duration is eight hours shorter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman said she arrived at the station 90 minutes before tickets went on sale, to book a spot on a train to Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the price, it's a bit expensive. Our tickets cost one thousand dollars each. But it's not convenient for us to travel by plane. We're old people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man said he normally drives to the mainland, but wants to try the overnight train instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically, I have to go to Beijing once a year and I like trying new things," he said.

 Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Eddie Yue on Wednesday said authorities are looking into the feasibility of further widening a wealth connect scheme to attract large sums of capital from the Greater Bay Area to the SAR.

  Speaking at a wealth summit, Yue noted that the city’s de facto central bank upgraded the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme” to a 2.0 version in February, to cover a greater variety of investment products and enabling more mainland investors to trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said the authorities are now studying whether the scheme can be upgraded to a 3.0 version, so the city can better cater to private banking customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s still in the early days, [but] we are talking to the industry very closely about what's needed. Is it the quota? Or is it the scope of products? Or is it the selling process?” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, the quota. Currently, the individual quota is up to three million renminbi, but that's actually not quite enough for private bank clients. Is there a way to have a separate channel to capture the private bank clients?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The selling process has been a lot easier and smoother than before. But can it be further streamlined? Or can the marketing be made more active? Can the education be done better? I think there are still areas that we can look into in terms of improvements,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue added that a significant increase in capital inflows from the north to the SAR was observed following the previous upgrade, and indicated that a further expansion could potentially attract more middle-class investors in the development zone who have the greatest need to diversify their assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme, launched in September 2021, was Beijing’s first tailor-made plan to boost sales and capital flows between Hong Kong, Macau and the nine other cities in the Greater Bay Area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Wednesday said the government's financial situation doesn't allow it to give staff pay rises as high as levels indicated by the latest pay trend survey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a proposed 3 percent increase for all civil servants, after the survey pointed to rises of between 4.01 and 5.47 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said on RTHK that the decision to give an across-the-board rise wasn't made out of convenience, and many factors were considered, including a budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under such a situation, we hope the pay rise can be a form of recognition of the work of civil servants, regardless of which grade they belong to," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also hope to maintain everyone's morale, or go even further and boost morale. We think this is the appropriate level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same programme, the chairman of the Civil Servants General Union, Fung Chuen-chung, said people who think civil service pay should be frozen because of the deficit are missing the point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there's an important point that society at large has overlooked. For quite some time, there's been a high turnover rate for civil servants. It's also very hard to hire new people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So [the proposed 3 percent rise] hasn't taken these important factors into account."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said lower-ranking civil servants are particularly disappointed, because the survey pointed to a 5.47 percent increase for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said she understands that such workers had hoped for more, but said in 18 of the past 31 years, lower-ranking workers received the same increases as middle-ranking staff, even when the survey indicated smaller rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An honorary chairman of the Senior Government Officers Association, Lee Fong-chung, also expressed disappointment that the proposed rise doesn't match the pay trend survey levels, but said at least it will help staff cope with inflation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rising Chinese long jump star Zhang Mingkun said he is determined not to let the pressure get to him as he seeks qualification for the upcoming Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old said he is going to keep his mind at ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During a jump, your mind really goes blank. All you do is to enjoy it,” Zhang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long jumper, who has a personal record of 8.13m, has been striving to reach the 8.27m entry standard for the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll find out in about a month's time on whether his dream would come true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the rest of the track and field team, the sprinters have been training with a new foreign coach ahead of the Games, and they see the benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Here, our training is relatively traditional... but it’s more scientific overseas,” said runner Wang Shuang from Jiangsu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Female sprinter Huang Ziting knows that the odds are against them, but reaching the Olympic stage remains the ultimate goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m certain every athlete would want to stand on the Olympic podium, but it feels like it would be more difficult for Asians [to achieve that],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sprinter, Chen Jinfeng, said getting to Paris requires not only strong performances but a bit of luck as well.

    Farage hit by soft drink after saying he'll stand

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Reform Party leader had just launched his campaign in the seat of Clacton-on-Sea. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756133_1_20240605081816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, new leader of Britain's right-wing Reform Party and thorn in the side of the governing Conservatives, was doused with a soft drink on Tuesday in his first full day of campaigning for a seat in parliament in the July 4 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Farage produced the biggest shock of the campaign by announcing he would head Reform and run in the election, a major blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose Conservative Party trails Labour badly in surveys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage is best known for helping to lead a successful campaign in 2016 for Britain to leave the European Union, and his popularity has put pressure on a succession of Conservative leaders to be tougher on immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after he launched his campaign in the seat of Clacton-on-Sea, southeast England, a woman threw a large cup of soft drink over him as he left a pub, footage posted on social media showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He appeared unharmed as he was led away by security and later posed smiling in a video posted on X holding a McDonald's cup and joking: "My milkshake brings all the people to the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Tice, chairman of Reform, called the attacker a "juvenile moron", saying his party would not be intimidated and the incident would help it win hundreds of thousands more votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they had arrested a 25-year-old woman on suspicion of assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister James Cleverly condemned the incident as unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former commodities trader who is often pictured with a cigarette and pint of beer in hand, Farage has for three decades been the figurehead of euroscepticism in Britain, and is no stranger to controversy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charismatic and divisive, he has in the past made comments that his opponents have called racist. During the Brexit campaign, Farage appeared in front of a poster showing lines of migrants under the slogan "Breaking Point"; last month he said Muslims did not share British values.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was doused in milkshake in 2019 while campaigning for the Brexit Party, Reform's predecessor, in Newcastle before a European Parliament election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, his attacker was ordered to pay for his suit to be cleaned after pleading guilty to common assault and criminal damage. (Reuters)

    Sunak, Starmer clash in first UK poll debate

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756124_1_20240605055114.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour challenger Keir Starmer went head-to-head on Tuesday over how to boost Britain's economy, with the PM accusing the opposition party of wanting to increase taxes if it wins power at a July 4 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Sunak, a Conservative, and Starmer stuck to their campaign lines in their first debate just weeks before a general election opinion polls suggest Labour is set to win, with Sunak saying only he had a plan to spur Britain's paltry economic growth and Starmer portraying the Conservatives as presiding over 14 years of economic chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a heated debate – a recent feature in Britain and one which sees more voters tune into politics – the two leaders battled over how to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, growing waiting lists in the public health service and reducing immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the questions illustrated what many voters are contending with: a cost-of-living crisis when some struggle to pay their household bills, long waits for the health service and lower standards in the education system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little new was gleaned from their answers, but an opinion poll taken immediately after the debate suggested Sunak had won the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Keir Starmer is asking you to hand him a blank cheque when he hasn't said what he'll buy with it or how much it's going to cost you," Sunak said in his closing comments. "In uncertain times we simply cannot afford an uncertain prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer responded saying he would never offer "the gimmicks or unfunded promises that Rishi Sunak does".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Imagine how you would feel waking up on July 5 to five more years of the Conservatives, five more years of decline and division, the arsonists handed back the matches," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now imagine turning the page with a Labour government that rolls up its sleeves and gets on with the job... The choice at this election is clear: more chaos with the Conservatives or the chance to rebuild Britain with a changed Labour Party." (Reuters)

    Wall Street up as jobs data boosts rates hope

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended a shade higher on Tuesday following softer-than-expected labor market data that reaffirmed expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Tuesday showed that US job openings fell to their lowest level in more than three years in April, signaling an easing in labour market tightness that supported a Fed rate cut this year. The US Treasury yields slipped following the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's main indexes gained ground after paring earlier loses. Equities in real estate and consumer staples sectors advanced ahead of others, while materials and energy stocks were the biggest losers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The labour market data was the latest in a string of recent reports that pointed to cooling US economic growth. Data on Monday showed that US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we've seen in the data so far this week is that it's been relatively weak, starting with manufacturing PMI and job openings today," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in Santa Monica, California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That has had a total effect of helping the rally in the bond market; but for the stock market, it's a double-edged sword because they're looking for a rate cut announcement, which has a rising probability with weaker data," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.36 percent, to 38,711, the S&P 500 gained 0.15 percent, to 5,291 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.17 percent, to 16,857.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacap technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, ended higher after losing ground early in the session. Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron fell 1.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, as demand concerns weighed on crude prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bath & Body Works slumped 12.8 percent after a lower revision to its quarterly profit forecast. Axos Financial dropped after Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in the lender. (Reuters)

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756115_1_20240605043215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong once again has three universities in the world's top 50, with two more narrowly missing the cut, organisers of the QS World University Rankings revealed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University ranked higher than ever before, while the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology returned to the top 50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU was up nine places at seventeenth overall while CUHK climbed eleven places to 36th in the world. Meanwhile UST rose 13 places, ranking 47th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ranking is based on a study of 1,500 universities around the world. Evaluators consider nine indicators, including academic reputation, what employers think of an institution, the ratio of students to faculty and whether the university has many international students, staff and global networks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CUHK saw its scores improve in most areas, most notably sustainability, where it finished 132 places higher than last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said in a statement that it is highly regarded for its environmental concepts and leadership in creating and applying sustainable development solutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CUHK also earned a perfect score for its ratio of international faculty and a high score for academic citations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its president, Rocky Tuan, said the results demonstrate CUHK's commitment to academic excellence and ability to compete with world-class universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, HKUST said that despite being a newer institution, its embraces innovative teaching methods and resources that adapt to evolving societal need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was making the most of new technologies like artificial intelligence to enhance student learning and promote the SAR's goal of becoming an international innovation and technology centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Polytechnic University ranked 57th, continuing a climb in recent years, while City University was 62nd. Two other local universities were also ranked: Baptist University was placed joint 252nd while Lingnan University was in the 711-720 band.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was first overall, ahead of Imperial College London and Oxford University. The National University of Singapore ranked best in Asia and eighth overall. Peking University was China's best, finishing 14th in the world.

    No deal without permanent ceasefire: Hamas

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, speaks at a news conference. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756113_1_20240605025603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas cannot agree to any deal unless Israel makes a "clear" commitment to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a senior official from the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Qatar, which alongside the United States and Egypt has been mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, has also urged Israel to provide a clear position that has the backing of its entire government to reach a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot agree to an agreement that doesn't secure, guarantee, and ensure a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and completing a real serious swap deal accordingly," Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, told a televised press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-phase proposal presented by US President Joe Biden on Friday involved in its first phase a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from "all populated areas" of Gaza and some hostages – including the elderly and women – would be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under that plan, Hamas and Israel would negotiate in the same phase a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last "as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamdan said: "Israel only wants one phase where it takes all its hostages, then it resumes its aggression and war on our people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We ask mediators to get a clear position from the Israeli occupation to commit to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has previously said it viewed the contents of the proposal positively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States said on Sunday that if Hamas accepted the proposed plan it expected Israel to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third phase in the proposal would include a major reconstruction plan for the enclave, which has been devastated by eight months of war, and the return of the remains of dead hostages to their families.  (Reuters)

 Japanese baseball great Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty on Tuesday to stealing nearly US$17 million from the athlete's bank account to pay off his own gambling debts, according to US prosecutors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ippei Mizuhara, the onetime translator and de facto manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers' power-hitting pitcher, pleaded guilty in a deal that had been announced last month, a US Attorney spokesperson said. Sentencing will be on October 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was previously filed in US District Court in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offence punishable by up to three years behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly US$17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former interpreter's lawyer declined to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ohtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. (Reuters)

    US sets new rules for migrants at Mexican border

<div class="itemFullText">
 Migrants caught illegally crossing the US-Mexico border could be denied the chance to claim asylum and quickly deported or turned back to Mexico under new restrictions announced on Tuesday, part of a sweeping enforcement effort by US President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new measures will take effect immediately and will have exceptions for unaccompanied children, people who face serious medical or safety threats and victims of trafficking, a senior official said on a call with reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat, has toughened his approach to border security as immigration has emerged as a top issue for Americans in the run-up to November 5 elections where he will face/ Republican Donald Trump in a rematch of the 2020 contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new asylum restrictions are not permanent, the US official told reporters. They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deterrent measures "will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully," the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.

    Injured Djokovic pulls out of French Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Novak Djokovic is saying goodbye to this year's French Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756102_1_20240604235342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic's disappointing season continued on Tuesday when the defending French Open champion was forced to pull out of the Grand Slam before his quarter-final due to a knee issue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The injury, sustained in his fourth-round win over Francisco Cerundolo, ended the Serb's quest for a record-extending 25th Grand Slam trophy and will result in him losing the world number one ranking to Jannik Sinner later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to a torn medial meniscus in his right knee (discovered during an MRI scan), Djokovic, who was supposed to play Casper Ruud in the quarter-finals tomorrow, has been forced to withdraw from the Roland Garros tournament," organisers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year's runner-up and seventh seed Ruud will now advance to the semi-finals, where he could face fourth seed Alexander Zverev or 11th seed Alex de Minaur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's marathon match was the second straight clash in which Djokovic was taken to five sets after his epic against Lorenzo Musetti and he has spent over nine hours on court in the last two rounds at the year's second major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb said he had been carrying an injury for a couple of weeks and that the problem had flared up when he slipped during his match against Cerundolo. The injury could also cast doubts over his fitness for next month's Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been a season to forget for Djokovic after his bid for a record-extending 11th Australian Open title was ended by eventual champion Sinner in the semi-finals, before he lost to lucky loser Luca Nardi early at Indian Wells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having been stunned by Ruud in the Monte Carlo semi-finals, Djokovic was thrashed 6-2 6-3 by Alejandro Tabilo in the third round in Rome last month, two days after being hit on the head by a fan's water bottle while signing autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic is still without a trophy this season after one of the most dominant seasons of his career in 2023 during which he claimed three of the four Grand Slam titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Sinner stepped up his bid for a second Grand Slam title by securing a 6-2 6-4 7-6(3) victory over Grigor Dimitrov, minutes after it was confirmed he would be the new world number one. A trickier test could await, however, as he faces a potential clash against fellow young gun Carlos Alcaraz who meets Stefanos Tsitsipas later. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Tuesday that they’d made four arrests around Causeway Bay in connection with offences including breaches of national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a 68-year-old woman was arrested for alleged offences relating to seditious intention under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance after shouting slogans on Yee Wo Street in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said a 24-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman were arrested on the same street. The man is suspected of assaulting two police officers while the woman was held for disorderly conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile a 23-year-old man was arrested at Hing Fat Street on suspicion of assaulting two park security guards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had increased their patrols in Causeway Bay and Victoria Park, with officers taking aside a number of people throughout the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the afternoon, an officer warned a man – who was holding up a large poster near Sogo department store – that he was disrupting public order, and demanded that he stop. The man was then brought to a police vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At night, officers patrolled East Point Road and also brought a number of people to police vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, police presence was also stepped up at Victoria Park, where they set up a tent. Officers requested some people in the park to enter the tent. They were released after being searched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to queries, the force said it would make appropriate operational deployments in light of threats to public safety, public order and national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police said three men and two women, aged between 27 and 88, were taken back to the station on suspicion of breaching public peace. All were later allowed to leave.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="According to evening vote count trends, Modi's BJP has unexpectedly fallen short of a majority, raising its reliance on allies to be able to form the next government. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756092_1_20240604213123.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two key regional allies in Narendra Modi's coalition have endorsed him as India's next prime minister, their spokespeople said on Tuesday, after trends showed Modi's party was falling short of a majority in a general election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal (United) said their pre-poll alliance with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)was intact and they would form the next government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their comments came after media speculation that the opposition alliance, which is doing much better than expected, was also in touch with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP is leading in 244 of the 543 seats in the directly elected lower house of parliament, according to evening vote count trends, unexpectedly falling short of a majority and raising its reliance on allies to be able to form the next government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, based in the southern coastal state of Andhra Pradesh, is currently the second-biggest party in Modi's National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the BJP. Naidu, who allied with the opposition the last time, has in the past spoken about loan waivers for farmers and privatisation of air and sea ports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "TDP has a pre-poll alliance with NDA and it will continue, no doubt about that," said party lawmaker K. Ravindra Kumar. "PM Modi and Naidu have congratulated each other."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party spokesperson Jyothsna Tirunagari said: "TDP has always shared a vision with PM Modi and he remains our PM face."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of the poor state of Bihar, has often switched sides and returned to Modi's alliance in January, having earlier helped form an opposition alliance of more than two dozen parties for the general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are formally with this NDA alliance and will participate in making the government," JD(U) spokesperson Abhishek Jha said. On being asked if the party would support Modi as NDA's prime minister, he said: "Definitely."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party focuses on issues of Bihar, especially for financial aid and investment to create jobs for its millions of young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two allies ... need stability at the centre to run their own states, but they will take their own pound of flesh," said Yashwant Deshmukh, founder of polling agency CVoter. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said tickets for overnight high-speed trains between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong would be available for sale from Wednesday noon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overnight trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and West Kowloon Station from June 15 from Fridays to Mondays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR said tickets would be available from Wednesday noon on the mainland's 12306 ticketing website or mobile app, and at ticket counters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares for one-way trips between Hong Kong and Beijing would be approximately between HK$937 and HK$1,448, while those between Hong Kong and Shanghai would be approximately between HK$682 and HK$2,128.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung welcomed the new arrangements which enhanced the services provided by the Hong Kong section of the express rail link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new sleeper trains...tailored to meet the passenger needs and provide them with a more convenient, comfortable and high-quality cross-boundary rail service, enhancing the travel experience for both business and leisure passengers," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Beijing resident said the new arrangement further encouraged him to visit Hong Kong one day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't like to travel by plane, so if high-speed trains have sleeping coaches, I won't feel tired even it's a long trip," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who's visiting Hong Kong, said she could manage time better if she travelled by high-speed trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to weather conditions these days, the situation of flight delays is very serious. My flight was delayed for almost eight hours, so travelling by high-speed trains may be more convenient," she said.

    Mainland tourism delegation wowed by HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Tuesday said an ongoing visit from a mainland trade delegation will provide more opportunities for the tourism industry and boost Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Representatives from eight mainland cities recently added to the Individual Visit Scheme are visiting the SAR to familiarise themselves with the city, to help them promote it as a destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delegation member Huang Ning, deputy general manager of a Harbin travel agency, said the group's visit will bring new momentum to the tourism market and foster economic and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The flight time from Harbin to Hong Kong is five hours. In the past, most of us would usually spend a night in Shenzhen before arriving in Hong Kong, but direct flights make it more convenient for passengers and more attractive to go straight to Hong Kong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People can go whenever they want. The launch [of Harbin's inclusion in the scheme] plus direct flights have really facilitated the desire for Harbin people to visit Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Xiaochun, general manager of Gansu Legend Travel Co. Ltd, said the shopping experience in Hong Kong is incredible, adding that she hopes the duty-free allowance for visitors can be increased from the current 5,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone is very friendly. This time we really felt that they were very hospitable. I really hope that the cap for the allowance can be increased. Our time here yesterday was too short. We felt that we didn't have enough time to go shopping," she said.

  <br/>
  "The shopping experience is very pleasant here. We bought so many sports brand products here and also a lot of Hong Kong delicacies and snacks. The snacks here are very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang Tenghong, executive director of Tibet Tourism Investment and Tourism Service Co. Ltd, said he was impressed by the attractions the delegation visited, including Central Market and Tai Kwun, adding that the SAR offers great food and scenery.

    Legco supports expanded sex offender checks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday expressed support towards the government's plans to expand checks on sex offender records to gradually cover the self-employed, volunteers and existing workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The current system allows voluntary checks on prospective employees seeking jobs related to children and the mentally incapable, meaning the employer needs the consent of the job-seeker to perform the check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials now want the scheme expanded in the fourth quarter of this year, first covering self-employed persons such as sports coaches, music teachers and tutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of next year, the scope would expand to cover volunteers, and eventually at an unspecified date, all existing employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco security panel meeting, legislators said they supported the plan, saying it was necessary to better protect children and the mentally challenged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legal sector lawmaker Ambrose Lam asked whether the SAR would follow the UK system, known as the Sarah's Law, under which parents can seek records on a person who can come into contact with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in Hong Kong, parents sometimes ask a friend to help pick up their children from school, and the SAR should be forward-thinking in preventing potential abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, security chief Chris Tang dismissed the idea, saying the two places are different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong this is too broad a scope. At the moment, friends would not be included under this [expanded] scope," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others expressed concern the expanded scheme would add more work for the police force, and that people who sought the checks would have to wait for a long time at police stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of lawmakers, including New People's Party's Dominic Lee, asked if officials could handle the applications electronically, such as using the government's iAM Smart mobile app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Tang said the app cannot replace the stringent checks on the conviction records required, because it involves fingerprints of all fingers and thumbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials would conduct loading tests before the new system is up and running, which is capable of handling more than 210,000 new applications a year. Last year, there were around 83,000 ongoing requests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said six police stations planned to set up designated kiosks, allowing people to have their fingerprints collected throughout the day to help speed up the process.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's military on Tuesday said it would resume all military activities along the demarcation line separating the two countries and the North West Islands after suspending an inter-Korean military agreement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspension of the military agreement with the North, which South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol approved earlier on Tuesday, was in response to North Korea's decision to send hundreds of balloons carrying trash over the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The South Korean military makes it clear that it will take all necessary measures to protect the lives and safety of its people in response to North Korea's provocations," a defence ministry official said in an emergency briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The large-scale spraying of filth balloons has "seriously threatened the safety of our people and caused property damage," the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang on Sunday said it had sent up 15 tonnes of wastepaper using 3,500 balloons, while Seoul vowed "unendurable" measures against the North in response, which could include blaring propaganda from loudspeakers directed at the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the military pact, both countries agreed to "completely cease all hostile acts against each other" that are the source of military tension and conflict, through measures such as the two sides ending military drills near the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the most substantive deal to come out of months of historic summit meetings between the two Koreas in 2018, but had been all but scrapped when Pyongyang declared last year it was no longer bound by it. (Reuters)

    Modi eyes triumph as India counts votes

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756050_1_20240604154917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election on Tuesday, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, TV channels showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The early see-saw trends spooked markets with stocks falling steeply and the rupee also fell sharply against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, where 272 is a simple majority, in early counting at 2pm Hong Kong time. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's centrist Congress party was leading in over 220 seats, higher than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TV channels showed BJP accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, short of a majority on its own, compared to the 303 it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third Modi term with a slim majority for BJP – or having to depend on NDA allies for a majority – could introduce some uncertainty into governance as Modi has ruled with an authoritative hold over the government in the last decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, politicians and analysts said it was too early to get a firm idea of the voting trends since a majority of ballots were yet to be counted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a fair assessment to say 400 at the moment certainly looks distant," BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli told the India Today TV channel, referring to some projections that gave 400 seats to the NDA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we need to wait...to have a final picture of the seats because the exit polls speak of a massive sweep, [and] the counting trends currently don't seem to match that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The BJP-NDA will form the government, that trend is very clear from the start," he added. (Reuters)

    Exco backs three percent pay rises for civil servants

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a Civil Service Bureau proposal to give staff of all ranks a 3 percent pay rise this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The increases would be lower than the rises of up to 5.47 percent indicated by the recent Pay Trend Survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said Exco considered various factors when agreeing to the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Executive Council has, in accordance with the mechanism governing the adjustment of civil service pay, considered six factors, namely the state of Hong Kong's economy, changes in the cost of living, the net pay trend indicators, the government's fiscal position, the pay claims of the staff side, as well as the civil service morale," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this is a balanced decision, taking into account all those six factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that while one in 10 civil service positions are vacant, salary is not the sole factor when it comes to retaining or attracting workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the pay rise proposal will be discussed with staff representatives on Wednesday before a final decision is reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, senior civil servants received a salary increase of 2.87 percent, while mid-ranking and junior staff had rises of 4.65 percent.

    Pair launch first civil action against JPEX
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two victims of alleged fraud cases involving the cryptocurrency trading company JPEX have lodged claims at the District Court to recover funds, in the first civil action against the platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The writ of summons, filed by plaintiffs Chan Wing-yan and Herbert Lee on Monday, listed JPEX Crypto Asset Platform as the first defendant, and locally-registered Web 3.0 Technical Support as the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three others, who appear as "holder of wallet address" for the three accounts on the trading platform, were also named as defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Chiu, a general manager of the over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange Coingaroo, is listed as the sixth defendant. The pair are also suing "any persons who carried out or assisted in the scheme".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the plaintiffs, Chan, said she invested with JPEX after being led to believe that the platform was a licensed cryptocurrency exchange upon attending seminars and reading posts from social media influencer Lam Chok, according to the legal document.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also claimed that she paid and transferred a total of HK$1.85 million to Chiu, intending to purchase USDT, also known as Tether, between July and August in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair found assets of more than 247,400 USDT were transferred away "within five minutes after each of the deposits was being made" without authorisation, and subsequently moved to "many other wallets of unknown holders" before they looked into their accounts on September 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plaintiffs are seeking to recover the lost funds and are asking the court to grant an injunction to bar the defendants to deal with the assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Chu, a lawyer handling the pair's claims, pointed to the far-reaching impacts of the civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the criminal investigation into the perpetrators continues, victims should also pursue civil proceedings to recover their lost assets. This dual-track approach is crucial, as the police are unable to return any seized funds without a court order from the civil case," he said in a statement to RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Notably, the findings from the civil proceedings may potentially bolster the parallel criminal investigation against the suspects, underscoring the importance of this multifaceted legal strategy for the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng, for his part, described the case as a "milestone", and that he understood that more victims have considered taking civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On my end, around 10 people have plans to make claims. Of course, I believe there might also be people who have yet to contact us [wanting to take action]," Ng said.

    AI biotech firm in first listing under Chapter 18C

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wen Shuhao, chairman of QuantumPharm (centre), says the introduction of the Chapter 18C rule shows the SAR's capital markets value the technology sector. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756023_1_20240604124200.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland artificial intelligence drug research firm QuantumPharm on Tuesday said it plans to raise up to HK$1.13 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), as it becomes the first company to take advantage of a new rule designed to entice technology firms to list in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tencent-backed firm, also known as XtalPi, is offering 187.37 million shares, 95 percent of which will be issued internationally and five percent of which will be issued in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price range of the shares will be between HK$5.03 and HK$6.03, with an “entry fee” of HK$6,091. Trading will begin on June 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The listing is under the Chapter 18C rule introduced by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in March last year, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies with a valuation of at least HK$10 billion are allowed to sell shares in IPOs even if they are yet to generate revenue. For firms that have generated revenue, the valuation threshold is reduced to HK$6 billion if they had at least HK$250 million in sales in the financial year prior to their IPO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the firm’s chairman, Wen Shuhao, said the introduction of Chapter 18C shows the city’s capital markets value the technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company plans to bring in eight cornerstone investors with a combined contribution of nearly HK$338 million to subscribe for the shares, including Peter Lee, the chairman of Henderson Land Development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Tam, QuantumPharm's chief financial officer, said he believes the Shenzhen-headquartered firm will be able to generate profits in the near term, despite seeing losses over the past three financial years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chapter 18C rule applies to applicants in high-tech, advanced hardware and software, new materials, new energy, as well as food and agriculture technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other firm which has applied to list under the rule so far is Black Sesame International Holding, which produces chips for autonomous driving.

    Overnight high-speed trains to run from June 15: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said overnight high-speed trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong from June 15, making transportation more convenient and cost-effective for passengers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Intercity passenger services, running at normal speed, used to carry travellers between Hung Hom and mainland cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but all services were suspended following the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said high-speed trains would be used to replace the normal-speed trains, and trains would run to and from West Kowloon Station instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the overnight trains would run from Friday to Monday, and would feature sleeping coaches for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are departures at night time, meaning that you board the train at night, and you arrive at your destination the next morning. Passengers spend the evening on the train, and there are also sleeping coaches, so after a night's sleep, you will arrive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very convenient, with a shortened journey time. You cut your travelling time by about 12 hours. You can also save on hotel accommodation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the journey time for overnight trains from West Kowloon Station to Shanghai and Beijing would be about 11 hours and 12.5 hours respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people would also be able to travel between Hong Kong and Hunan Province from June 15, with six new destinations including Zhangjiajie and Fenghuang Ancient Town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there would be more short-haul train services as well.

    Govt urged not to increase water charges

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has been urged to abandon the idea of increasing charges for water, with a community campaigner warning that some people can't afford to pay any more.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials note that Hong Kong's water charges haven't gone up for almost three decades and are much cheaper than in other advanced cities. They say any increases – to help plug a budget deficit – would be gradual and mild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Sze Lai-shan from the Society for Community Organization told RTHK on Tuesday that low-income households would struggle to cover higher water bills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the authorities should consider waiving water charges altogether for people living in sub-divided flats, or provide them with a subsidy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung, a member of Legco's development panel, said the Water Supplies Department should consider implementing cost-cutting measures before increasing charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are some new technologies, equipment, and materials. They can also simplify work procedures and outsource some tasks. Implementing these measures can reduce costs," he said
  <br/>

  "Right now they're running out of money, and need more income. Shouldn't they explore these options before they do what some people have described as 'pulling a knife on them?' Wouldn't this approach result in greater acceptance from the public?"

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing head of the Law Society, CM Chan, has said the body would soon announce a reform package on disciplinary proceedings for solicitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During his tenure as head of the regulator for solicitors, the society handled a number of high-profile complaints, with some still unfinished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes 16 cases the national security police referred to the body for alleged professional misconduct regarding the now-defunct 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund - which provided legal and other support for people arrested during the 2019 protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another unsettled probe is one against a law firm taken over by the society in 2020, after it was accused of violating solicitor accounting rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Ming Pao Daily newspaper published on Tuesday, Chan said the Law Society hasn't undertaken major reforms in decades and has to "move with the times and make improvements in many aspects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the aim is to improve efficiency and shorten the time needed for investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said while some people "find the wording and red lines of the national security laws to be vague", he thinks the public should read relevant judgments more to understand the reasoning and not just the verdicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong is a co-host of the National Games next year and Chan told the Sing Tao Daily that the SAR could make use of this to develop sports arbitration and promote relevant legal work.

    National security threats are very real, CE says

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has warned that Hong Kong must remain on guard against attempts to endanger national security or disrupt public order.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said that a landmark subversion ruling handed down by a local court last week demonstrated that national security threats are very real.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen people were found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion by taking part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government. Another 31 people had earlier pleaded guilty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked how the authorities would deal with people marking June 4 in public, Lee said all activities must be conducted according to the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should not forget the pain that we all went through in the attempted colour revolution which took place in 2019," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acts which endanger national security can happen "all of a sudden", and perpetrators may use different excuses to disguise their intentions, he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law enforcement agencies will take action according to existing provisions, Lee stressed, including the Public Order Ordinance and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

    Education officials to look into HKU reshuffle: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education authorities are to look into reported infighting within the governing council of the University of Hong Kong after it reportedly approved changes to senior staff without consulting its president, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the university's president and vice-chancellor, Zhang Xiang, is seeking legal advice after being kept in the dark about the appointment of several interim vice-presidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes reportedly include a demotion for Richard Wong, Zhang’s right-hand man and deputy vice-chancellor, who has been serving as the university’s interim provost since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that Wong has been appointed as a vice-president and will oversee institutional advancement, while his original post will be taken up by Vivian Yam, a professor at the science faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee, who is chancellor of the university, was asked what will be done to protect the institution's reputation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "HKU is a successful university that belongs to the Hong Kong SAR. Hong Kong citizens and I myself, of course, have high expectations of good governance in HKU," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have tasked the Education Bureau to learn more about what is happening. They will report to me, and then I shall discuss with them about the way forward."

    Chang'e-6 lunar probe successfully lifts off from moon

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said a spacecraft carrying rock and soil samples from the far side of the moon lifted off from the lunar surface on Tuesday to start its journey back to Earth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ascender of the Chang’e-6 probe lifted off and entered a preset orbit around the moon, the China National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 probe, comprising an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner -- like its predecessor Chang'e-5 -- was launched on May 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its lander-ascender combination touched down at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on June 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Missions to the moon’s far side are more difficult because it doesn’t face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During its mission, the probe adopted two methods of moon sampling, including using a drill to collect subsurface samples and grabbing samples on the surface with a robotic arm. It automatically gathered diverse samples at different sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The samples collected will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the Inner Mongolia region on June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission is the sixth in the Chang’e moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang’e-5, which did so from the near side in 2020. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of China's top gymnasts said they have different ways of dealing with the pressure that comes with intense training ahead of the Paris Olympics, as they shared with RTHK their journeys to reach the highest level of their sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xiao Ruoteng, who won silver in the individual all-around and bronze in the floor event at the Tokyo Olympics, said he has been battling injuries, including shoulder, wrist and ankle problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old stressed the importance of pushing himself to the limit, adding that he still sees himself as a young athlete hungry for success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no going back if we want to get to the top. We have to do what ordinary people can't do... Although this will be my second time at the Olympics and people might think I'm experienced... my mentality is that of a first-time Olympian. I'm excited about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xiao noted that the national team would focus on the team competition as a crucial opportunity to win the gold medal, which will then give them momentum in the subsequent individual events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan won gold on the parallel bars at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou acknowledged the pressure that comes with being in the spotlight, but said he got help from his teammates in handling that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all under pressure. Athletes need confidence during competitions, regardless of the pressure. Other athletes are under pressure too and I try to learn from my teammates. If they can handle it well, what can I do to be like them?" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qiu Qiyuan, a promising 16-year-old specialising in the uneven bars, said support from her coach and family helped her overcome the pressure and injuries she has faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pressure is definitely there, but we have to turn that pressure into motivation because if we can't take that pressure, there's no way we're going to fight for Olympic gold," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had this injury two years ago and I had an operation. It's not a big problem. I'm recovering well. Now I have adjusted mentally. My coach and my family are helping and encouraging me."

    Djokovic sows doubt after hurting knee in thriller

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Novak Djokovic reacts after falling during his fourth-round match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755977_1_20240604063503.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic sparked concerns about his injured knee for the rest of his French Open title defence, with the top seed saying he briefly considered pulling out midway through his five-sets win over Argentine Francisco Cerundolo on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old had to dig deep for a second straight match after a third-round marathon against Lorenzo Musetti and needed medication during a 6-1, 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 win over Cerundolo that sent him to the quarter-finals after four hours and 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic said he had been experiencing slight discomfort in his right knee for a couple of weeks and the issue flared up as soon as he slipped and tweaked it during the third game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At one point I didn't know whether I should continue or not with what's happening. I got the medications and then, after the third set was done, I asked for more medications and got them," said Djokovic, who also had his knee worked on by a trainer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, who also took a tumble late in the contest, said drier conditions after a week of rain had affected the clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The injury that I had today with the knee happened exactly because of that, because I slipped and slid a lot," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone slides on clay, but I slipped way too many times. That is quite unusual. I do, because I have an aggressive kind of movement, dynamic change of directions. It's normal for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've slipped and fallen on the clay many times in my life, and on grass as well, but this was just too many times today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic said his team were having a conversation with tournament officials about why his requests to have the courts swept more frequently were being denied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up next for him is seventh seed Casper Ruud in a rematch of last year's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I injured myself. I survived. I won the match. Great. But will I be able to play next one? I don't know," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know the severity of the injury. But could have this injury be prevented? Possibly, if there was just a little bit more of frequent care of the court during the set." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged higher in a choppy session on Monday amid soft manufacturing sector data and as a glitch on the NYSE briefly caused trading halts in dozens of equities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange had triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold. Trading in at least 60 NYSE-listed stocks was halted due to the volatility, before the bourse fixed the technical issue and activity resumed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished higher after paring earlier losses on the sesson, while the Dow lost ground. Technology stocks were the biggest gainers, while energy equities were the biggest drag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets had weighed data showing US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month, raising concerns of weakening economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of those days where people are waiting for the next catalyst with a choppy move after earnings," said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's bit of a tug of war between the market seeing weakening data and the expectation that the Fed may cut rates," Lerner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.30 percent, to 38,571, the S&P 500 gained 0.11 percent, to 5,283 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.56 percent, to 16,829.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia rose 4.9 percent after CEO Jensen Huang revealed that the company's next-generation AI chip platform would be rolled out in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of other megacaps, including Apple, Amazon , Alphabet, and Meta closed higher. Microsoft and Tesla finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop soared 21 percent after a weekend Reddit post from stocks influencer Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty", showed a US$116 million bet on the gaming retailer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will be eyeing a data-packed week that includes surveys on the services sector, factory orders and Friday's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, which could provide clues to the Fed's likely course of action with regards to rates. (Reuters)

 The Israeli military said on Monday that four more of the Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 have died in captivity and that their bodies are being held by the Islamist group.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The military identified the four men as Chaim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper, and Nadav Popplewell, all of whom were filmed alive in hostage videos posted by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that new intelligence led to confirmation of their deaths. Hamas had posted a video of Popplewell last month and said that he had died of wounds sustained during an Israeli air strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We estimate the four of them were killed together in the area of (the southern Gaza city) Khan Younis a number of months ago while being held by Hamas terrorists, at the time IDF forces were operating in Khan Younis," Hagari said in remarks that were broadcast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are thoroughly examining the circumstances of their deaths and checking all possibilities. We will present soon the findings, first to their families, and then to the public," he said. "We will present them with transparency, as we have done until now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the more than 250 people abducted on October 7, about 120 remain in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Many have been declared dead by Israeli authorities. (Reuters)

    Mbappe completes Real Madrid deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France forward Kylian Mbappe has joined Real Madrid as a free agent on a five-year contract, the LaLiga club said on Monday, ending a transfer saga that rumbled on for years before the European champions captured their newest "Galactico".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Real Madrid CF and Kylian Mbappe have reached an agreement whereby he will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons," the Spanish champions said in a statement, fresh off their 15th European Cup triumph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old captain of the French national team had announced he was leaving Paris St Germain in a video posted on social media platform X on May 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe will move to Real Madrid in July when his PSG contract expires on June 30 but the forward will be unveiled before joining up with the France squad for the European Championship in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe joins a star-studded side in Madrid with the likes of Ballon d'Or favourites Vinicius Jr. and Jude Bellingham, led by Italian Carlo Ancelotti – the most successful coach in Champions League history with five titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Mbappe won several trophies at PSG, often completing domestic doubles and trebles, the Champions League has eluded him and remains the only major honour left to complete his sparkling resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe leaves PSG after seven years at the club where he won six Ligue 1 titles and four French Cups, finishing his career in the capital city as the club's all-time top scorer with 256 goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2018 World Cup winner surprised PSG last year when he sent a letter stating he would not take up the option of a one-year contract extension when it expires in June. The letter led to a standoff with the club and Mbappe was omitted from the first-team squad before being reinstated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Allowing Mbappe to run down the final year of his contract meant PSG were unable to recoup any of the 180 million euro (US$195.95 million) transfer fee they paid in 2017 to sign him from AS Monaco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid had courted Mbappe in the past but failed to land the player, who signed a contract extension with PSG in May 2022 when the Spanish club had a bid rejected. (Reuters)

    Technical fault sees Berkshire Hathaway shares plunge

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755960_1_20240604010544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold, and trading halts in dozens of other companies on Monday, before the bourse fixed the problem.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange, by late morning said on its website it had resolved a reported technical issue and that the impacted stocks had resumed trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 60 stocks listed on the NYSE were halted due to volatility and some stocks showed unusual outsized movements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold shares were shown to be down 99.97 percent and 98.54 percent, respectively, due to the technical issue, before those trades were corrected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NYSE said the problem was related to Limit Up-Limit Down bands meant to prevent extraordinary market volatility and extreme price movements in individual stock by preventing trades outside of specific price ranges that are updated throughout the trading day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price band for each security is set at a percentage level above and below its average price in the preceding five-minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bands were developed as part of the response by financial regulators and exchanges to the "flash crash" of 2010, which wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in market capitalisation in a few minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Technical issues on exchanges can hit markets, impact traders' confidence and attract scrutiny from regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think the overall market is reacting," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. (Reuters)

    Brexit champion Farage to fight UK general election

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nigel Farage speaks at a Reform UK launch event in London. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755957_1_20240603233903.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, the colourful politician who helped champion Britain's departure from the European Union, said on Monday he would stand as a candidate in next month's election and will lead the Reform Party in a blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by Farage, now a TV host and previously honorary president of Reform, will boost his movement's profile and challenge Sunak's governing Conservatives for the support of right-leaning voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage, 60, had previously said he would not stand in the July 4 vote in order to help his friend Donald Trump fight the US election later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I’ve decided I’ve changed my mind," Farage told a news conference. "It’s not always a sign of weakness, it could potentially be a sign of strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage has stood unsuccessfully for parliament seven times but is still one of the most influential British politicians of his generation, putting pressure on a succession of prime ministers to take tougher positions on Europe and immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the last general election in 2019, Farage's party decided not to contest seats held by the Conservatives, then led by Boris Johnson, to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls suggest the opposition Labour Party is on course for victory this time, with the Conservatives staring at one of the worst results in their history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support for Reform runs at about 10 percent nationally, giving the party the third highest vote share, polls show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But under Britain's winner-takes-all system, the party had not been expected to win any seats. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea have appointed Enzo Maresca as their new head coach on a five-year contract, the English Premier League club said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian will leave Leicester City, whom he led to promotion back to the Premier League in his first season in charge, and begin his new role on July 1, Chelsea said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has proven himself to be an excellent coach capable of delivering impressive results with an exciting and identifiable style," said Chelsea's sporting co-directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley. His ambitions and work ethic align with those of the club."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leicester were disappointed to see Maresca leave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With Enzo’s decision made and the board’s terms for his departure met, we wish him well in his future endeavours," they said in a statement. "He leaves with the appreciation of everyone at the Club for his work in helping us to achieve an immediate return to the Premier League."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old replaced Mauricio Pochettino, who left the club last month after one season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Argentine Pochettino, the west London side put together a strong run late in the season to finish sixth and secure European football, a marked improvement on their 12th-placed finish in the 2022-23 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca will be tasked with returning Chelsea to the Champions League which they won for the second time in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old previously coached Manchester City's youth team and was the senior side's assistant coach under Pep Guardiola during their treble-winning season. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary has set June 25 to be the starting date for a mitigation hearing for Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hearing will start at 10am, and is expected to last for three days at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan last week passed judgement in the case, finding 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion, while acquitting two. Thirty-one others had earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice had announced its intention to appeal against the acquittals.

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755943_1_20240603205235.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan high court on Monday overturned a treason conviction against former prime minister Imran Khan, who remains in jail on other charges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The conviction was one of three slapped on Khan in the runup to February elections, which he claims were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision by a two-member bench at Islamabad High Court was announced by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the first big case which was part of the political victimisation against Imran Khan and Shah Mahmood Qureshi which has been dashed to the ground," Salman Safdar, a lawyer for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was convicted along with Qureshi, his former foreign secretary, of making public a classified cable sent to Islamabad by Pakistan's ambassador in Washington in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had touted the cypher as evidence that the United States had conspired to force him from power in 2022, when a no-confidence vote saw him replaced by the opposition. The United States and Pakistan's military have denied the accusation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan remains jailed on a seven-year sentence for breaking Islamic law by marrying his wife Bushra Bibi too soon after her divorce. He has also been found guilty of graft over gifts he received in his time as premier between 2018 and 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While his 14-year sentence was suspended in April, the conviction still stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was ousted by a parliamentary no-confidence vote after falling out with the top generals, and in opposition he waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts regard Pakistan as a "hybrid regime", where the military establishment wields immense power to determine the course of ostensibly democratic politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan later found himself tangled in more than 200 court cases, massively complicating his attempts to mount a comeback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite that, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party in the February elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A broad coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military kept the MPs from power. (AFP)

    HK boosts hospitality to promote tourism

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kevin Yeung says improved hospitality could help provide better services to tourists. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755935_1_20240603182037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Monday launched a campaign to promote good hospitality in the SAR and provide better services to visitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he hopes to make courtesy and good services a priority in all sectors after noting a few cases online of tourists being treated rudely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said authorities will produce training videos and recruit more people for the Hong Kong Pals Volunteer Programme – dedicated to sharing recommendations and tips with visitors – in hopes of making Hong Kong the best tourist destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most important thing is to make our tourists feel welcome. We can do that with a smile, or by asking a few questions or just making them feel cared for," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want their needs to be met. I'm confident that Hongkongers are hospitable by nature. We're polite. We need to do more to remind each other so that we can do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrangements of the Waterbomb music festival, Yeung said he does not want an isolated incident to make people think that Hong Kong can't host events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People had to wait for hours in heavy rain after bad weather caused chaos at the K-pop and hip hop music festival over the weekend. Many fans were upset that they missed performances because of a storm signal, and were forced to wait for hours to retrieve their belongings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Organisers need to offer high-quality services so their customers feel they're spending their money well. With outdoor events, we always remind organisers to be cautious and to be prepared for extreme weather, which is quite common in Hong Kong from May to October. They need to consider what measures to take to deal with these contingencies," Yeung said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people in connection with the unlawful movement of a dead body outside a factory building in To Kwa Wan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they received a report on Sunday that a man was drunk, lying unconscious outside Merit Industrial Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unconscious man was sent to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deceased, 40, did not sustain any obvious injuries. An autopsy will be conducted to verify the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing on Monday, chief inspector Law Chin-hon said the three suspects, aged 35 to 40, allegedly moved the body to the scene with a trolley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The four people had been hanging out in a unit at the factory building in which someone had alcoholic drinks. Later on, the deceased felt uncomfortable and became unconscious. The other three men used a trolley to move him to the place where the report was made and then fled the scene,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said all four people involved were mainland-Chinese and came to Hong Kong through two-way permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that one of the suspects was found to have overstayed their visa and was also arrested on breach of condition of stay.

 China believes all efforts should be recognised in supporting peace measures around the Russia-Ukraine war, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China has never "fanned fire or fuelled the flames", said Mao Ning, addressing a question on a peace summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia and China of attempting to undermine his planned global peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China attaches great importance to its relations with Ukraine and remains its largest trading partner, Mao said, adding that China's position on the peace conference is very "open and transparent".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that we can get the understanding and support of all parties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland is seeking a broad-based turnout from different parts of the world for the summit, which Bern hopes will lay the groundwork for a peace process in Ukraine. (Reuters)

    Collaboration needed to boost tourism and consumption

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Representatives from the catering, hotel and retail industry on Monday urged the government to implement new measures including AI-generated itineraries and "island-hopping" activities, as a means of boosting consumption and tourism given that many of sectors had not fully recovered from the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Eunice Yung said authorities should take advantage of the summer vacation period to attract tourists. She said a big data platform would allow sectors to better understand tourists' needs, adding that an "AI-tourism ambassador" would also personalise the vacation experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need a big data platform to keep all these mega events or what we can [do] to provide support for these mega events. We need an AI travel ambassador to promote and to give a good and accurate routine or travel itinerary for the tourists even if they want to stay for a longer time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said the government should consider dispersing mega events to different parts of the SAR so that more businesses can benefit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that authorities can also take advantage of Hong Kong waters for tourism activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can have some activities on those [outlying] islands, but if we can link up all these islands so that Hong Kong can be a hub for hopping to different islands. Each island can have different activities, but this is a long-term project and we have to put a lot of investment in that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't find any similar places in the world, which has so many islands, which we can use it as an aquatic hub for tourists and also for people in Hong Kong. If we are close to the sea, we have to think of something with the activities, which is related to the sea."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caspar Tsui, executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, hopes the government could get the sectors more involved with mega events in the SAR after the government announced an increase in these events from 150 to 210, adding that Hong Kong offers the "best package" for tourists with high-quality hotels, retail and restaurants.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National security police on Monday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said seven people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested last week in connection with seditious posts published on social media ahead of what officials described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow continues to be remanded at Tai Lam Centre for Women. The other six have been released on bail, with police accusing one of them of funding fugitive Nathan Law and other individuals through an online subscription platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's understood that a 62-year-old man arrested in Sha Tin on Monday is Chow's uncle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He's detained for further investigation.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Results showed Claudia Sheinbaum was the clear winner in Mexico's presidential vote. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755895_1_20240603170500.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Results on Monday showed Claudia Sheinbaum was elected Mexico's first woman president by a landslide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Electoral Institute announced after a quick count that Sheinbaum won around 58 to 60 percent of the vote, more than 30 percentage points ahead of her main opposition rival Xochitl Galvez, also a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum later announced that her opponents had conceded the race to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory for Sheinbaum was a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture and home to the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum was also the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election was also the biggest in the country’s history. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions were up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has vowed to improve security but has given few details while the election was the most violent in Mexico's modern history with 38 candidates murdered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many analysts say organised crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during outgoing President Lopez Obrador's term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico's modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong's economy would continue to grow despite the challenges brought by geopolitical tensions and changes in consumption patterns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting on financial affairs, Chan said growth in employment income and a recovery in the stock market should help increase private spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho asked what would be done to help the struggling retail sector after sales dropped in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was in talks with central authorities for measures to boost the local economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are indeed looking into increasing the duty-free allowances for visitors returning to the mainland right now. The HK$5,000 figure has been in place for quite some time. We have been liaising with the central authorities on this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have recently included eight other cities in the individual visit scheme, and we will seek to expand the scheme even further. While we do understand that we should have more such policy support in place, we should be prudent in the effects or potential impact of these measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election committee lawmaker Tan Yueheng was concerned over whether there would be measures to reverse the trend of Hongkongers heading north to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may be hard to compete in terms of prices, but we can enhance the quality of services in Hong Kong. So how can we promote two-way consumption to enhance the contribution of consumption to GDP in Hong Kong?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Chan said the city should look for ways to improve product and tourist experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our unique attractions. We never compete with others in terms of price. We compete with others in terms of the quality of services. We compete with others in terms of the quality of our goods and services and the experience we offer," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think various sectors, be it retail or catering, we all need to transform and enhance our competitiveness and increase the cost to value of their products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief noted that property prices have stabilised after the scrapping of all "spicy" property cooling measures, adding the SAR would think of ways to avoid getting caught up in the cross-hairs of Sino-US tensions.

    Govt says water bill rises would be 'gradual and mild'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of water supplies said the government plans to raise water bills in a gradual and mild manner, noting there was a need to make a timely adjustment as the charges have stayed the same for nearly three decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials have been reviewing the charges since the start of the year, as part of a wider study on the cost recovery of public services amid a budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Sing Tao Daily newspaper published on Monday, the Director of Water Supplies, Roger Wong, said besides recovering costs, the users' pay principle would also be a basis for the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the recovery rate of the water services operating accounts was at an historic low of 79 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water bills in Hong Kong, Wong added, made up around 0.1 to 0.2 percent of household expenditure, roughly a tenth of that in other advanced cities around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director stressed that people's affordability was a major consideration, but he didn't say when an adjustment might be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Laundry Association chairman, Chau Hon-keung, said on RTHK that he thinks now is not the time to add to people's burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said if charges are raised, the costs would surely be passed on to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have told the director [in a meeting] that if you haven't raised charges for so long, it's fair enough to increase them. But we don't think it's good timing, because everybody is finding things tough at the moment," Chau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's no other way, then do it softly. Don't raise it by double digits as some organisations have done in the past...we hope the increase will be about five percent - rather than close to 10 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said on the same programme that any minor increase would add tremendous pressure on the catering sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although water bills are not a big part of our operating costs, we are really worried [an increase] would lead to a chain reaction, such as raises in power bills, management fees and others that cause inflation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said as some Hongkongers had been making trips north of the border for retail and dining, he thinks caterers wouldn't dare hike their prices if water bills went up.

    National team eye sweep of Olympic diving golds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will be looking to complete a sweep of the gold medals in diving in the upcoming Paris Olympics, after falling just short in Tokyo three years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Zongyuan, who took gold in the men's synchronised 3m springboard at the Tokyo Games, said the national team are training hard, both physically and mentally, so they would make waves again in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China came first in seven of eight diving events in Tokyo, and Wang said it's the national team's dream to do even better this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First of all, it is the entire diving team's dream to win all eight gold medals at the Olympics, but we have to do our best and work hard to keep on polishing our technique with just two short months before the Games begin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That way, we can thrive in the face of pressure and perform to the best of our abilities to hopefully capture those eight medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teenager Quan Hongchan, meanwhile, will be looking to defend her 10m platform title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guangdong native, as a 14-year-old, secured three perfect 10s to finish with an Olympic record 466.20 points in Tokyo, more than 40 points ahead of compatriot and silver medallist Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan said she will perform to the best of her ability in Paris, adding that a gold for either her or teammate Chen will bring honour to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For now, what I mainly want to do is perform my best dive, and not think of other issues. I will just think about my movements, how to do it, and how to dive well," Quan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, I do have confidence. No matter who wins gold between the two of us, as long as it’s a Chinese winning, that’ll be fine.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen, who brought home a gold in the synchronised 10m platform event with Zhang Jiaqi in Tokyo, said members of the national diving team are very supportive of one another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since everyone is representing China, we should collectively aim to bring glory to our country. Whether it’s an individual or a pair event, we should fight hard and aim to bring honour together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the Olympics, we hope that everyone on the team can show their capabilities, their strength and their spirit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three athletes said their families, friends and fans have all been a big part of their athletic careers, so they want to do well to repay them.

 A lawmaker on Monday urged the government to set up an interdepartmental group to formulate a strategy to ensure it keeps up with the growing use of low-altitude flying technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan Siu-hung is among a group of lawmakers who want the government to lead projects in the SAR, such as using drones for food and medicine delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said mainland officials support this sector's development, and local authorities in the SAR should do the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said other cities in the Greater Bay Area - such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Zhuhai - were planning to build air transport networks using drones for logistics and transport services and to transport passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Hong Kong cannot afford to lag behind," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said unmanned aircraft had been flying successfully on the mainland for several years with stable operations, "but Hong Kong has yet to make significant progress in this area".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the technology, supply chain and ecosystems for these activities were already mature on the mainland "so I think the (SAR) government should promptly establish an interdepartmental working group on the low-altitude economy to formulate comprehensive strategies for the development of this fast-growing sector".
