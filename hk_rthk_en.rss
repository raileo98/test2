<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Express Airways on Sunday apologised to two passengers with visually impairment who were asked to leave its flight in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The incident came to light after the Hong Kong Blind Union said two of its members had complained that they had been unreasonably forced to leave the plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference, the union said the airline had cited safety reasons for asking them to leave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the low-cost carrier apologised for the inconvenience and delay caused to the passengers and promised to provide compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It clarified that its ground staff and crew members had different assessments of the situation of the two passengers. A thorough assessment was carried out by management and the two individuals were unable to board their originally scheduled flight, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline said it was eventually confirmed that both passengers could safely travel unaccompanied and staff immediately arranged for them to board a later flight on the same day.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business remained resilient despite geopolitical headwinds last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said assets under management stood at more than HK$31 trillion in 2023, up about 2.1 per cent year-on-year, with two-thirds of the assets coming from outside the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that the SAR remained the second largest private equity management centre after the mainland, with private equity fund assets exceeding HK$1.7 trillion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The above figures show that despite the changing international geopolitical situation, investors still have confidence in the prospects of the mainland and Hong Kong markets," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is important for us to do our job well and continue to explain how the country is steadily improving, the central government's strong support for Hong Kong and the unique benefits under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the city's flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, had announced that it would buy back the remaining preference shares from the government this month, showing that the aviation industry was moving towards full normalcy.

    Biden remains defiant in TV interview

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden's presidential reelection bid hung in the balance Saturday, after his latest efforts to put a disastrous debate showing behind him failed to silence voices urging him to quit the White House race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murmurs of dissent within his own Democratic Party have -- in the case of five individual House representatives -- morphed into direct calls for him to drop out. And a number of key donors have threatened to cut off funding if Biden insists on staying the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump," Angie Craig, the latest House Democrat to break ranks, said Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democrat representatives for Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democrat Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the upper chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what had been billed as a make-or-break TV interview on Friday, Biden's strategy was to flatly deny the falling poll numbers and concerns over his mental and physical fitness triggered by his dismal performance against rival Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed a severe cold for the debate debacle and insisted it was just a "bad night" rather than evidence of increasing frailty and cognitive decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the 81-year-old was adamant that he would not be pressured to end his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race," he said. "But the Lord Almighty is not coming down."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for less divine intervention do, however, appear to be strengthening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's campaign team is pushing ahead regardless, with two events planned in Pennsylvania on Sunday and visits to other battleground states later in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in Wisconsin before Friday's interview, Biden had delivered a forceful, energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then came the sit-down with the ABC network that appeared unlikely to soothe the concerns of critics who say that -- away from a teleprompter -- Biden can struggle to communicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of his answers were tentative, meandering and difficult to follow, even as he sought to deflect questions about his mental acuity and dismissed the notion that his party would consider replacing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign had another small fire to put out Saturday after it emerged that the White House had provided the questions for interviews the president gave to two Black radio stations on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic strategist David Axelrod suggested in a CNN op-ed that Biden is engaged in "Denial. Delusion. Defiance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stakes are as great as Biden describes. And if he believes it, as I think he does, he will eventually do what duty and love of country requires, and step aside," Axelrod wrote in the piece published Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If he does not, it will be Biden's age, and not Trump's moral and ethical void, that will dominate the rest of this most important campaign and sully the president's historic legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, meanwhile, sarcastically suggested Biden should "ignore his many critics and move forward, with alacrity and strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He should be sharp, precise and energetic, just like he was in The Debate," the Republican challenger said in a social media post Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, Democrats are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the meetings of top Congressional Democrats in coming days will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, for Biden and his campaign team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next major test will be a press conference scheduled for Thursday during the NATO leaders' summit in Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When pressed in the ABC interview on why he doesn't take an independent neurological exam, Biden argued that the role of US president meant being subjected to constant mental assessment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a cognitive test every single day," he said. "Not only am I campaigning, I'm running the world." (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760555_1_20240707081526.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An own goal by Mert Muldur completed a dramatic comeback for the Netherlands on Saturday as they overcame a tenacious Turkey 2-1 to book a Euro 2024 semi-final meeting with England.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defender bundled the ball into his own net in the 76th minute under pressure from Cody Gakpo as the Dutch bounced back from a poor first-half display to win a bruising clash and complete the final four line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stefan de Vrij had equalised only six minutes earlier after Turkey went into the break 1-0 up from Samet Akaydin’s 35th- minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey rode waves of passionate support at the Olympiastadion to get on course for an unlikely semi-final place but, after keeping the Dutch at bay they finally succumbed to the pressure in the last 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only one of the weekend’s quarter-finals to be completed without extra time or penalties was no less drama-filled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey’s goal came after a strange decision from Dutch fullback Denzel Dumfries to let a shot, which had clearly deflected off Nathan Ake, go out for a corner when he could easily have kept the ball in play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The resultant set piece was initially cleared but fell for teenager Arda Guler to deliver a perfect cross to the back post and Akaydin was first in a queue of three Turkish players to rise and head home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goal came after sustained pressure from Turkey, who had seen off early Dutch dominance, to set up several opportunities, including a succession of corners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enterprise from the Dutch was met with tenacious defence as Turkey giving their opponents little room to play in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not help the Dutch cause that attackers Memphis Depay and Gakpo looked flat, prompting coach Ronald Koeman into throwing on pinch hitter Wout Weghorst at the start of the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the imposing centre forward looked to sew panic among the Turkish defenders, however, it was at the other end that the next opportunities arose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guler’s 56th-minute free kick was bent expertly around the Dutch wall but struck the outside of the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten minutes later, Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen got a hand to deny Baris Alper Yilmaz’s stinging shot and Kaan Ayhan missed out on tucking away the rebound as Weghorst cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch kept plugging away and, as Turkey’s defence became more scrambled, they finally made the breakthrough with Depay’s cross finding an unmarked De Vrij to head home in the 70th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege continued and it was matter of time before the Dutch grab a second, bundled in six minutes later as Gakpo pressurised Muldur after a cross by Dumfries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tired-looking Turks, drawing last vestiges of energy from rabid support from the majority of the capacity crowd, gamely sought to take the game into extra time but had desperate efforts blocked by the Orange defence and Verbruggen made another key save in stoppage time. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barely a week after furious fans hurled beer cups and insults at Gareth Southgate, the England manager danced with his players in front of the team's supporters on Saturday after a thrilling shootout victory launched them into the Euro 2024 semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Southgate's men defeated Switzerland 5-3 on penalties after regulation ended 1-1, with Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka scoring a brilliant equalizer when he cut in from the right wing and curled a blistering 20-metre left-footed shot in off the far post following Breel Embolo's opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate's 100th game as England boss was his team's best in an uninspiring tournament that has seen the 53-year-old come under fire and speculation swirl about his future in the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then you think 'Surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job?'. So if I can't enjoy that moment, then the whole thing is a waste of time," the normally unflappable Southgate said, on letting loose to dance with his players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win put England in their third semi-final in four tournaments, where they will face either Turkey or the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I love the players, I love being in that moment with them. I took this job to try and improve English football. I wanted us to regain credibility on a world stage. So I can't deny that when it's as personal as it's been in the last few weeks on a human level, that's quite difficult," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we're fighting. We're not going to stop fighting. And as I said, we're in another semi-final and we'll see where we can get to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold converted from the penalty spot to clinch the win. The Liverpool defender joyously grabbed the ball as it rebounded out of the goal and booted it high into the air as his teammates hurtled forward in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were watching the (Spain-Germany) game last night and I spoke to them about it, just about playing well. Spain mixed their game up. They took seven yellow cards. They found ways to win," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These players are showing all those other attributes, dealing with everything that's around us. Twice coming from behind in games, now a penalty shootout where their composure was impeccable. So I'm so, so proud of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've been in four (shootouts), we've won three. We got absolutely crucified for the one we lost."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate was particularly pleased for Saka, who was subjected to racial abuse after missing the decisive penalty in their Euro 2020 final loss to Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I gave him a massive cuddle on the pitch," the manager said. "He's a special boy. He's a dream to work with. Wonderful family. And, of course, you're pleased for everybody, but for him especially when his went in." (Reuters)

    Red Bull's renowned designer Newey delays future plans

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Adrian Newey at the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix 2024 in Miami, USA. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760536_1_20240706214641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Newey, the much-coveted designer who is leaving Red Bull, will not make any announcement on his future until September at the earliest - and may delay a decision until the end of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newey, 65, has been linked to Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Williams and Aston Martin, since saying he wanted to leave Red Bull where he has won 13 world titles in nearly two decades of success with the team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has suggested he will continue to work in Formula One and may not make a final decision until later this year after easing off "to focus on final development and delivery of Red Bull's first hyper-car, the RB17", as revealed by Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know. At the moment, I'm just kind of still working on the RB17, our track car, and just taking some time off, Newey told Sky Sports F1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last week, actually, we took seven days and had lucky timing with the weather and went around the south coast with our dogs in an old Aston Martin DB6. Great fun!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if he had to decide his future by a deadline at the end of the year, he said, "That's certainly the target. I'll need to have my mind up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newey, widely regarded as a guru of ground effect technology, is expected to leave Red Bull finally in March next year, allowing him to take part in the development of a new car for the new 2026 regulations with whichever team he joins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was reported to have had a tour of Aston Martin's factory last month and has been in negotiations with them, but any deal with the ambitious Silverstone team is unlikely to be announced before September to comply with his contract at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Martin last week recruited the highly-rated former Mercedes engine boss Andy Cowell to take over as group chief executive officer, replacing Martin Whitmarsh in October. (AFP)

    Winning all that matters at Euro 2024 for Mbappe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Portugal's forward Cristiano Ronaldo embraces France's Kylian Mbappe prior to the UEFA Euro 2024 quarter-final match. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760540_1_20240706221117.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three goals scored in five games, one a penalty and two own goals, and yet Kylian Mbappe's France are into the semi-finals of yet another major tournament as Spain await at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is remarkable that any team could get to the last four of such a competition despite struggling so much in front of goal, but all the more so when that team is captained by arguably the best forward in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe is surrounded by other world-class attackers, but his penalty in a group-stage draw with Poland is the only goal scored by a French player at this European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having edged Belgium in the last 16 thanks to a late own goal, France came through a nail-biting quarter-final against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal on Friday, triumphing 5-3 on penalties after a goalless two hours of football in Hamburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said it before lots of competitions. The most important thing is that we win," Mbappe told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People thought it was a wisecrack. I have only scored one goal but we are in the semi-finals and I am really happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In charge for 12 years and at his sixth major tournament, France coach Didier Deschamps has regularly been criticised for not playing thrilling football with an extraordinary collection of players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has always got results, with France winning the 2018 World Cup and 2021 UEFA Nations League under his watch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the 2022 World Cup final on penalties to Argentina and the Euro 2016 final in extra time against Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now they are in a fourth semi-final in the last five major tournaments despite their paltry record in front of goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece may be remembered as perhaps the least spectacular side to win such a competition, but their status as outsiders at Euro 2004 justified a more cautious approach, and they still scored seven goals in six matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including their 0-0 friendly draw against Canada just before the Euros, France have gone six games without one of their players finding the net in open play, a first in 60 years according to statisticians Opta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That record has not prevented them advancing to the semi-final against a Spain side who have found the net 11 times in Germany. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Saturday prepared for its most consequential legislative election of recent times, with residents of overseas territories opening voting for a poll expected to give the far right its biggest ever presence in parliament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A traditional final day pause was observed on Saturday ahead of Sunday's second round runoff after a frenetic campaign that saw tensions rise across the country and dozens of attacks on candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Underlining France's global footprint that spans the oceans of the world, the first French region to vote was Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a small French archipelago off the coast of Canada where citizens began voting from 1000 GMT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were to be followed on Saturday by residents of French Caribbean territories including Martinique and Guadeloupe as well as Guiana in South America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Pacific territories come next before people in mainland France cast their ballots from 0600 GMT on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls will close by 1800 GMT on Sunday when projections of seat numbers -- regarded in France as a firm indicator of the final outcome -- are published.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Final opinion polls on Friday suggested that far-right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) would fall short of winning an outright majority in the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Emmanuel Macron's gamble in calling snap elections is expected to end with his centrist alliance having half the number of deputies it had before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now faces the final three years of his presidency with no clear ruling majority, and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal perhaps trying to hold together a caretaker government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen insists that she is still on course for victory and an absolute majority that would force Macron to appoint her 28-year-old lieutenant Jordan Bardella as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attal vowed to stay on "as long as necessary" in a caretaker role, while Macron's office is studying options to maintain some form of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron is to remain in office until presidential and legislative elections in April 2027, but he must now face the possibility of sharing power with political foes. (AFP)

    New UK PM Starmer 'restless for change' after win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly elected UK prime minister Keir Starmer on Saturday began his first full day in charge declaring himself "restless for change" and pledging that growth would be his Labour government's "number one mission".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer also confirmed his previously declared intention to end the outgoing Conservative government's flagship scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started... I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent," he told reporters following his first cabinet meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party on Friday won a landslide election victory, bringing to a close 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour leader told his top team, including Britain's first woman finance minister Rachel Reeves and new foreign minister David Lammy, it had been "the honour and the privilege of my life" to be invited by King Charles III to form the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a huge amount of work to do, so now we get on with our work," he said to applause and smiles around the cabinet table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer spent his first hours in Downing Street on Friday appointing his ministerial team, hours after securing his centre-left party's return to power with a whopping 174-seat majority in the UK parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable lower-ranking appointments included Patrick Vallance, chief scientific government adviser during the Covid-19 pandemic, who has been made a science minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Timpson, whose shoe repair company employs ex-offenders, was also made a prisons minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both would be given seats in the upper house of parliament in order to join the government as neither is an elected lawmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said both new ministers were people "associated with change" and illustrated his determination to deliver concrete improvements to people's lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm restless for change, and I think and hope that what you've already seen demonstrates that," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists on Friday had welcomed Starmer to Downing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But daunting challenges await his government, including a stagnating economy, creaking public services and households suffering from a years-long cost-of-living crisis. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damian McKenzie landed two late penalties as New Zealand beat England 16-15 in the first Test on Saturday to make a winning start to the tenure of new coach Scott Robertson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held their nerve in a brutal defensive contest in Dunedin in which both teams scored two tries, extending their winning run on home soil against England to eight matches since 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It took a grinding effort in the second half to secure victory after England winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso scored a try to break a 10-10 deadlock at the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks struggled to penetrate a disciplined England defence and never threatened a try in the second half, but they did enough to set up McKenzie for penalty goals in the 54th and 65th minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie was timed out when lining up a third penalty attempt in the dying stages but England failed to score from the final play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks came into the game after just 10 days under former Canterbury Crusaders mentor Robertson, who succeeded Ian Foster after the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had also lost a handful of experienced players -- retired or playing abroad -- in the wake of their World Cup final loss to South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coming off a 52-17 win over Japan two weeks earlier, England played with great cohesion but also struggled to create try-scoring chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither team led by more than five points throughout an absorbing contest dominated by the physicality of the collisions and some confusion on rulings made by Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England fly-half Marcus Smith missed an early penalty before All Blacks winger Sevu Reece opened the scoring with a try after fielding a McKenzie cross-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors struck back through a close range try by lock Maro Itoje but New Zealand regained the ascendancy when 2023 World Player of Year Ardie Savea capitalised on a break from full-back Stephen Perofeta to score in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand conceded a penalty after the half-time hooter which was slotted by Smith to square the scores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England dominated the opening exchanges after the break and created space for Feyi-Waboso to cross in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England prop Joe Marler could be in doubt for the second Test in Auckland next week after exiting early with a foot complaint while All Blacks scrum-half TJ Perenara didn't return from the half-time break following a knee injury. (AFP)

    Reformer wins presidential runoff in Iran

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An electoral official said the voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760513_1_20240706155606.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian said the vote was the start of a "partnership" with the Iranian people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy, and trust. I extend my hand to you," Pezeshkian said in a post on social media platform X, after on Tuesday saying he would "extend the hand of friendship to everyone" if he won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act "against the system".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for "constructive relations" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to "get Iran out of its isolation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping congratulated reformist Masoud Pezeshkian for his win in Iran's presidential runoff election, state media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I attach great importance to the development of China-Iran relations and am willing to work with the President to lead the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership towards deeper advancement," state news agency Xinhua reported Xi as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries "have a long history of friendly exchanges, and bilateral relations have maintained healthy and stable development... for over half a century," Xi said, according to Xinhua.(AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Baccalaureate or I-B has released results for its May diploma exams, with at least 29 Hong Kong students achieving the highest possible score.
 <br>
  <br/>
  IB issued the results to the schools on Friday night, and students were able to access their individual results on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the local top-scorers, 17 students from the English Schools Foundation’s seven schools achieved a perfect score of 45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also four top-scoring students from Diocesan Boys' School and two from Victoria Shanghai Academy and Singapore International School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One top performer each hails from St. Paul's Co-educational College, St Stephen's College, Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School and Yew Chung International School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  23 local students attained the top grade in the 2023 exam.

    Customs uncover first underground cigarette factory

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Saturday said they have uncovered the first ever underground cigarette factory in Lau Fau Shan. They said the facility was equipped with a complete production line.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities also uncovered a cigarette storage warehouse in Man Kam To and seized over 20 million suspected illicit cigarettes and about 3.5 tonnes of processed tobacco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the haul had a market value of HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four men, aged 29 to 46 were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Custom’s division commander Lam Chak-lun said the investment in this cigarette production line had been huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, it was located in a prefabricated building. And the building was heavily insulated with industrial soundproofing material, hidden inside a factory,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can effectively block light and noise generated while the machines are running. It was also powered by solar panels, likely to avoid drawing attention from authorities due to high electricity usage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities said they believed the production line was on a test run and had only been operational for a short time.

 Two women accused of kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O were remanded in custody after appearing in court on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair, Xue Shanshan and Leung Lai-wa, both unemployed, faced a charge of kidnapping for allegedly forcibly taking the boy against his will from a mall on Wednesday with the intent of obtaining ransom in exchange for the child's release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy, allegedly taken for a ransom in cryptocurrency, was rescued by officers in the flat in Tseung Kwan O on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Court Magistrate Don So rejected a bail application from one of the women, and the other did not apply for bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case has been adjourned until September 23.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun on Saturday expressed confidence that a lawyer appointed to chair a statutory body overseeing social workers will command the respect of the sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Herman Hui was among 12 new members picked by the government to the reformed Social Workers Registration Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a radio programme, the minister acknowledged that the board's chairperson was not a registered social worker, but noted his status within the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Herman [Hui] is well-known in the welfare field. He has been serving the sector for more than 30 years. While he's not a registered social worker, I'm sure for those in the welfare sector, Herman is so well-known because of his dedication, commitment, and also selfless service to the sector. I'm sure he's going to command the respect of the sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said it did not matter where the board members came from, following suggestions that the government could bring in representatives from smaller organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said members were appointed to the statutory body on a personal basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are requested to carry out their duties dutifully, and not having regard to where they are coming from. There's no difference for those coming from larger, smaller, or medium-sized welfare organisations, because they look after social workers from an independent point of view," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Social Workers Registration Board was only concerned with the registration of individual social workers, and not welfare institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not relevant whether or not they are coming from larger or smaller organisations in the field," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grace Chan, the business director of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, is the deputy chairperson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other members include former permanent secretary for labour and welfare Annie Tam, as well as members of the government's social welfare advisory committee, Frederick Lai and Barry Wong, who are all part of a coalition, the Hong Kong Social Welfare Sector Heart to Heart Joint Action.

    Firefighters struggle to contain California blazes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wildfires are becoming increasingly common - partly as a result of climate change. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760478_1_20240706090917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 California firefighters battled multiple blazes in record heat on Friday, with a new fire breaking out near the famous Yosemite National Park even as a larger inferno further north came under control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Temperatures up to 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) were recorded in the western US state on Friday, as the region's latest heat wave nears its peak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Dangerous heat is likely to become more widespread in the West today and Saturday... Temperatures will be 15-30 degrees above average for much of the West Coast today," warned the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or broken," the NWS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The excessive heat comes on the July 4 weekend, when millions of Americans celebrate the anniversary of their nation's independence with displays of fireworks that can spark blazes in hot, dry conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fast-moving fire erupted just outside Yosemite National Park late on Thursday, causing large parts of the former Gold Rush town of Mariposa to be evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Friday afternoon, the fire had burnt nearly 405 hectares and was 15 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winds have calmed which has helped firefighters make progress overnight," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some residents had been allowed to return to their homes. The fire's cause was not yet known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also progress in northern California, where earlier this week thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Thompson Fire near Oroville.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some of the region's highest temperatures, firefighters reported success in containing the blaze, with some evacuation orders lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, fire officials and forecasters warned that the danger is far from over, with high temperatures expected to spread further and to peak Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week," warned the NWS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate scientists say the western US is undergoing a decades-long aridification as weather patterns change, at least in part because of human-caused global warming. (AFP)

    HK 'hoping for locally-bred panda': Kevin Yeung
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tourism chief Kevin Yeung says the SAR delegation to Sichuan will discuss matters such as transport and quarantine arrangements for the two giant pandas. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760485_1_20240706102646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials plan to tell Beijing of the SAR's desire for a locally bred giant panda during a visit to fine-tune the arrangements for two animals that the central government is giving to the city, according to the tourism chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, also said on Saturday that he hoped the two giant pandas will arrive in the city in two to three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister, along with Chief Executive John Lee, his wife, and other officials, are set to head to Sichuan on Sunday to know more about the arrival of the two giant pandas and discuss transport and quarantine arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Yeung said local officials are expressing their wish to see the birth of the city's first panda cub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that most people in the SAR would like to see pandas being born in Hong Kong. We've expressed this wish," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, the central government is gifting us a pair of giant pandas. I believe they'll take our wish into consideration. But in the end, it's up to the central government and mainland departments to decide."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the two animals could come to Hong Kong in around two to three months, but it would ultimately depend on their conditions after quarantining for a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's tourist figures, Yeung said he is confident that this year could see 46 million arrivals, with more people expected to visit Hong Kong during the summer and public holidays in the latter half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he conceded that spending patterns have changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector, as a whole, cannot simply rely on spending from tourists to boost sales... Other than thinking of ways to attract tourists to spend more here, we also need to look for ways to have people in Hong Kong spend more," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said authorities will conduct test runs at the Kai Tak Sports Park in early 2025 by hosting a sporting event and a performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the administration hoped to have around 50,000 people test out the venue and transport arrangements.

    'I was sick. I was feeling terrible' - Biden

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Campaign officials have resisted suggestions that President Biden may withdraw from the presidential race. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760477_1_20240706090231.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden vowed on Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on "feeling terrible" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong," the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that "Biden sounds great!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's focus on what really matters," Biden said, reading from tele-prompters. "We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose (in November)", she said. "This is realism, not disrespect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" he do more major interviews to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the Nato meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside. (AFP)

    Deadline looms for beleaguered Boeing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are assembled at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760474_1_20240706084446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than five years after two fatal 737 MAX crashes, Boeing faces a fresh legal reckoning now that prosecutors have concluded the company flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aviation giant had been on a Friday night deadline to accept or reject a Department of Justice proposal that would require it to plead guilty to fraud during the certification of MAX airplanes, sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been no public comment either way by the evening, and a lawyer for the families of the 737 crash victims, Robert Clifford, told AFP that he believed the deadline would be extended over the weekend if Boeing asked for more time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest legal predicament was triggered by a DOJ determination in mid-May that the company ignored a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not meeting requirements to improve its compliance and ethics program after the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under a proposal presented by the DOJ to families of MAX crash victims, Boeing would pay an additional US$243 million penalty and agree to have an external monitor, said Tracy Brammeier, an attorney at Clifford Law who represents families of MAX victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The guilty plea is significant. No one wants to be a convicted or admitted felon," said Brammeier, who nonetheless described family members as dissatisfied with the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a US court on how it will proceed no later than July 7, with the agency expected to announce steps to prosecute Boeing should the company reject the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing, which has previously said it honoured the terms of the DPA, declined comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021 near the end of the Trump administration over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification of the MAX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year. But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing breached its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of victims, who have pressed for a criminal trial of Boeing and its top executives, remain unhappy that the new plea agreement does not explicitly link Boeing's fraud to the 346 fatalities from crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, according to Brammeier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The families want accountability and still are not getting it," Brammeier said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash, said the DOJ should also impose much stiffer fines on Boeing -- from US$10 billion to US$20 billion -- with the caveat that they could be suspended if the company invests in safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's too good a deal for Boeing," said Stumo, who added that Boeing should not have a say in who is appointed its independent monitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, said the DOJ's decision to stick with the original charge -- rather than supplement it -- reflects a desire to "bring the claims that could be most easily proven if it goes to trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said DPAs like Boeing's often "poorly serve" the public interest because "prosecutors probably care much more about achieving a conviction than ensuring the defendant is adequately deterred and restrained," he wrote in a blog post this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coffee suggested the DOJ should consider measures such as barring CEO compensation models that encourage risk-taking, or ensuring that funds clawed back from executives who plead guilty of wrongdoing go to whistleblowers as a way "to shift some of the cost of deterrence from shareholders to senior management." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (centre) looks on at the Spain-Germany match. The hosts were knocked out of the tournament. Photo: Reuters." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760473_1_20240706084058.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain will face France in the semi-finals of Euro 2024 after knocking out hosts Germany as Turkey reacted with dismay to defender Merih Demiral's two-match ban for making an alleged ultra-nationalist salute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luis de la Fuente's Spain triumphed 2-1 in an engrossing match between the two best-performing teams at the tournament, thanks to Mikel Merino heading home Dani Olmo's cross just as the match looked destined for a penalty shoot-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a winning horse... I'm proud to coach players like this, players that are insatiable," said De la Fuente.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a tough end to the tournament for Germany, who pushed Spain all the way and took the match to extra time with Florian Wirtz's 89th-minute strike which levelled Olmo's opener for La Roja.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We played a good tournament but when you're so close, to be eliminated like that, it's bitter," said Toni Kroos after his final Germany match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain now will be favourites to claim a record-breaking fourth European crown after their seventh straight win inspired by Olmo, who replaced injured Pedri after just eight minutes following a clash between the Barcelona midfielder and Kroos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came through a huge test against the Germans in Stuttgart and will pose a completely different kind of problem to France, who beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties after a drab match finished goalless after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Theo Hernandez coolly struck home the winning spot-kick as France went through to the last four despite their only goals from open play in the tournament being scored by opposition players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix was the only player to miss in the shoot-out, striking the base of post, meaning that Portugal go home and ageing icon Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score a goal at a major tournament for the first time in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France have reached the semis in four of the last five tournaments and coach Didier Deschamps said: "We mustn't take that for granted, that's what I always say. It's what all the players in the team deserve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey's government blasted as "unfair and biased" Demiral's ban, which means he misses Saturday's last-eight clash with the Netherlands and that his Euros campaign is over unless Vincenzo Montella's team reach the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demiral was the unlikely hero with a brace in Turkey's 2-1 win over Austria in the last 16 and during celebrations for his second goal made a gesture associated with Turkish right-wing extremist group Grey Wolves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UEFA banned Demiral for, among other things, "violating the basic rules of decent conduct", a move which Turkey's Sports Minister Osman Askin Bak claimed was politically motivated and Montella said was based on a "misunderstanding".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It wasn't a political gesture as it was interpreted," insisted Montella, who added that the wolf gesture is a "symbol of the Turks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will have a vociferous backing in Berlin for a match which will be attended by the country's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claimed Demiral was just "showing his excitement".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England will have Jude Bellingham available for their quarter-final with Switzerland after he was handed a reprieve by UEFA for his crotch-grabbing celebration after keeping the Three Lions in the competition in the last 16.

  Bellingham, who has scored twice in Germany, was filmed mimicking the gesture while apparently looking towards Slovakia's bench following his stunning stoppage-time overhead kick which took that match to extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gareth Southgate called UEFA's ruling, which allows him to select his star player, a "common sense" decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there was no intent in the gesture towards anybody other than the communication he has with his family," claimed Southgate.

    Canada's jobless rate hits 29-month high

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760452_1_20240705232143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's unemployment rate rose to a 29-month high of 6.4 percent, data showed on Friday, highlighting that people might be losing jobs as the labour market struggles to absorb a rapidly swelling population.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jobs report, which also showed that youth unemployment reached almost a decade high barring the pandemic years, prompted money markets to increase bets of a rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) this month to around 56 percent from 40 percent a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists pointed out that the rising unemployment rate could be indicating that Canada is flirting with recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A sustained deterioration is typically only seen during recessions," Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note, pointing to the 1.4-percentage-point rise in the jobless rate since January last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that if the jobless figure was considered independently, it was likely that the central bank would cut rates in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada lost a net 1,400 jobs in June, Statistics Canada said, against analysts' predictions of 22,500 job gains, in further indications of weakness in economic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group, said the sharp rise in the unemployment rate will have many questioning whether Canada has entered a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lowering interest rates is the only way to soften the blow from upcoming mortgage renewals and keep any hope of a soft landing alive," he said, adding that the BoC would cut rates by 25 basis points this month and another two rate cuts in the three meetings thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said last month that the labour market had cooled reasonably in recent months, and that achieving the central bank's goal of cooling inflation did not need to involve a sharp rise in unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was even room for economic growth and jobs creation without imperiling the bank's target of 2 percent inflation, the governor said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday said positions in the Ukraine war were "far apart" and "many" steps would be needed to end the conflict after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have found that positions are far apart. The number of steps needed to end the war and bring about peace are many," the Hungarian leader told a press conference alongside Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in terms of dialogue and restoring dialogue, the first important step has been taken today and I will continue this work," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told Orban that Ukraine must abandon four regions in the east and south that Moscow claims as its own if Kyiv wants peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about the full withdrawal of all troops from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and from the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions," Putin said in televised remarks after what he called a "frank and useful" conversation with Orban in Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban informed Nato ahead of his visit to Moscow, alliance head Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, Viktor Orban is not representing Nato at these meetings. He's representing his own country," Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hungary agrees that Russia is responsible for the war. Russia is the perpetrator, and Russia can end this war today by stopping attacking Ukraine," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban unsettled the European Union and Nato allies by flying to Moscow to sit down for talks with Putin, with whom he has long fostered friendly relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said he viewed Orban as a representative for Europe, despite EU leaders emphasising that Orban was acting on his own initiative in an exclusively bilateral role with no mandate to speak for the bloc. (AFP)

    US job gains ease as unemployment edges higher

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Weak jobs data suggests the US economy is cooling steadily. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760448_1_20240705224017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US job gains eased slightly in June while unemployment edged up, government data showed on Friday, in a sign that the world's biggest economy is cooling steadily.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wage growth decelerated, although it still outpaced consumer inflation. But this has not translated into rosy sentiment over the broader economy, adding to President Joe Biden's challenges as he seeks re-election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country added 206,000 jobs last month, the US Labour Department said, marking a slower pace of hiring than May's revised 218,000 figure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gains still beat a Briefing.com consensus estimate of 185,000, signalling that the labour market remains relatively resilient despite high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jobless rate ticked up from 4.0 percent to 4.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, the figures point to a "very gradual, orderly cooling" in the market, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she pointed to signs of weakness, including downward revisions to April and May hiring numbers by a cumulative 111,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The uptick in unemployment, though narrow, also marks the highest level since November 2021 – ending a 30-month stretch where the rate stood at or below 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of overall gains came from government employment, noted Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. This means that headline gains do not paint a full picture of the labor market's health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other aspects of the data indicate a slowing job market," he said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temporary hires dropped by 49,000, indicating that business demand for labour is falling, Fratantoni said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wage growth slowed from 0.4 percent in May to 0.3 percent last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compared with a year ago, the increase was 3.9 percent – also easing from before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Weakening demand for labour will lead to further moderation in wage growth," said economist Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this is likely to bolster the US Federal Reserve's confidence that inflation is on a downward path to policymakers' 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest report comes on the back of a slump in activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, alongside easing inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While there is some way to go, these indicators will likely give the US central bank more confidence to begin cutting interest rates after holding them at a high level in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This move could, in turn, give the economy a boost. (AFP)

 China and Tajikistan have decided to elevate their ties to comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era during President Xi Jinping's visit to the Central Asia country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision was based on the current development needs of bilateral ties, the two countries said in a joint statement after Xi held talks with his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing and Dushanbe also announced they will jointly build a multimodal transport corridor linking China and Turkey via regional countries including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China and Tajikistan also expressed the willingness to continue deepening cooperation on the China-Europe freight train services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Sichuan on Sunday for a three-day visit to know more about arrangements for the arrival of two giant pandas from the province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on Monday that the central government will send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a government statement, Lee and his delegation will visit the Dujiangyan Base of the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. He will also meet with leaders of Sichuan Province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife; Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung; director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department Mickey Lai; and representatives from Ocean Park will be joining the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE thanked the mainland authorities for their support, adding that the SAR government will make adequate preparations in receiving the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thank the Sichuan Provincial Government for attaching importance to the overall arrangements of gifting giant pandas to the HKSAR," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meticulously deliberate on and understand the preparatory work for receiving the two new members of the Hong Kong family. The HKSAR Government will endeavour to make good arrangements for welcoming the giant pandas."

    'Govt mulls cutting Tai Lam Tunnel tolls'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government may introduce time-varying tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760439_1_20240705205800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government is considering various proposals that would reduce tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel after taking control of it in May next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, tolls for private cars and taxis stand at HK$58.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities have met representatives from various political parties to discuss the proposed changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One idea being floated is to charge private cars from HK$20 to HK$45, based on the time of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also proposals to lower the tolls for private cars and taxis to HK$35 or HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option under consideration is to keep the current tolls unchanged, but officials fear that may lead to congestion at nearby Tuen Mun Road, Tolo Highway and Ting Kau Bridge during the rush hour by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who is a member of Legco transport panel, called on the government to introduce time-varying tolls at the tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At one hand, we need to ensure that even during peak hours, Tai Lam Tunnel can continue to be a convenient and not very congested route for different users, especially for our commercial vehicles, because that's a very important corridor for Hong Kong logistics industry," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, the residents, they do have very high expectation of a toll reduction of the Tai Lam Tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien urged the government to lower tolls to less than HK$35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've always used the VC ratio, which is the volume capacity ratio of 1.2 as a basis of calculation. If we use VC ratio of 1, which means the capacity is equal to the volume, every single bridge and tunnel in Hong Kong will be considered overcapacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the couple of scenarios that they use all resulted in the Ting Kau Bridge having a volume capacity ratio less than 1.2. If that's the case, we still have room for the downward adjustment."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB says many women encounter difficulties when trying to find jobs after a break. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760429_1_20240705195809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called for greater support for women to re-enter the workforce as part of efforts to tackle a manpower shortage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said only 56 percent of women in Hong Kong are working, a figure that is lower than other regions of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said women who chose to leave their jobs to give birth or take care of their family members face difficulties when trying to return to the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is hard for women to go back to work after leaving for a while. They face difficulties such as low education background and no relevant experience, and there is not enough support for them. Is it a must for women to pick between family and work rather than having it all?” Quat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Associate professor Dai Haijing from the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Social Work Department said women still face workplace discrimination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe the gender effect is still there because the majority of caregivers in the world, they are women. Fathers are doing pretty well in Hong Kong compared with other places in the world... [while] filial daughters taking care of their ageing parents are being penalised in the labour market,” Dai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong turns out to be very conservative in terms of gender ideology; there should be some advocacy for gender equality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another DAB lawmaker, Frankie Ngan, urged the government to take the lead in expanding childcare services, such as setting up childcare centres in government facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also suggested that the Employees Retraining Board provide more flexible courses to mothers, among other ideas.

    Legco approves three percent civil service payrise

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers approved a three percent pay rise for civil servants. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760410_1_20240705172551.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday approved a three percent pay rise for all civil servants, with the increase backdated to the start of April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government asked for HK$8.7 billion to cover the rises, which also apply to teachers and those working at the ICAC and other subvented bodies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pay trend survey had pointed to increases of between 4.01 percent to 5.47 percent for civil servants of various ranks, but officials stressed those numbers were only one factor to consider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several unionist lawmakers said the government needs to explain further why it decided on rises lower than the survey indicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung described the three percent increase as reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She stressed that a key factor this year is the administration's deficit, and its goal of achieving a fiscal balance in three years or so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we have significant expenses this year, it will affect the government's progress in trying to achieve fiscal balance. So we have thought about this. We have tried to strike a balance with different factors," she told Legco's Finance Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it is not the case that we will not follow or deviate from the pay trend indicators. It would depend on the circumstances of the year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip said it's high time the government revamped the pay adjustment system for civil servants, saying some staff have left and other people don't want to join because workers get paid the same, regardless of their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Hong Kong could look to Singapore, which pays its government workers through different types of bonuses on top of a basic salary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said in response that officials would need to consider such a move carefully, including whether the public would accept the idea of civil servants receiving bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added, however, that she agreed officials need to work on ways to create more incentives for civil servants to perform even better.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer vowed to rebuild Britain as its next prime minister after his Labour Party on Friday surged to a landslide victory in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of Conservative government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour won a massive majority in the 650-seat parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rishi Sunak's Conservatives suffered the worst performance in the party's long history as voters punished them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services and a series of scandals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did it," Starmer said in a victory speech. "Change begins now... We said we would end the chaos, and we will, we said we would turn the page, and we have. Today, we start the next chapter, begin the work of change, the mission of national renewal and start to rebuild our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election result has upended British politics. Labour won some 410 seats, an increase of 210, while the Conservatives, the western world's most successful party, lost about 250 lawmakers, including a record number of senior ministers and former Prime Minister Liz Truss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scottish National Party imploded, losing 38 seats, ending its own decade of dominance in Scotland and leaving its dream of independence for Scotland in tatters, while conversely the Irish nationalists Sinn Fein became Northern Ireland's largest party for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the populist right-wing Reform UK party, headed by Nigel Farage, the Brexit campaigner and friend of Donald Trump, won more than four million votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While it secured only four lawmakers, its impact on the outcome by siphoning vast tracts of Conservative support will make Farage a major thorn in the side of the two major parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A glum Sunak conceded defeat and will meet King Charles later to formally resign before Starmer is appointed in his place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides," Sunak said. "There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates... I am sorry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party. Thanks to the quirk of Britain's first past the post system and a low turnout, Labour's triumph was achieved with fewer votes than it secured in 2017 and 2019, the latter its worst result for 84 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pound and British stocks and government bonds rose on Friday, but Starmer comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, have already been scaled back while Starmer has promised not to raise taxes for "working people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Likewise, he has promised to scrap the Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but with migration a key electoral issue, he will be under pressure himself to find a way to stop tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel from France on small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't promise you it will be easy," Starmer said. "Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. It's hard work. Patient, determined, work, and we will have to get moving immediately." (Reuters)

    'Many people disappointed with plastic cutlery ban'

File photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760402_1_20240705164848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Greenpeace survey suggests many people are sceptical about the recent ban on restaurants giving customers plastic cutlery, saying it does little to reduce waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The green group interviewed around 1,000 adults in May, seeking their views on the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 60 percent said they felt the new rules have little impact on waste reduction, while seven in 10 said they still threw away disposable cutlery made from alternative materials such as pulp or bamboo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said on Friday that it means little that the cutlery is eco-friendly, if it still ends up in landfills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an effort to raise awareness on sustainability, the group collaborated with local artist Kevin Cheung to create an eight-metre whale-shaped installation from over 2,000 pieces of disposable tableware. It will be on display at the West Kowloon Cultural District until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This whale shows the volume of disposable cutlery used ... our environment is still suffering," Tam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace is calling on authorities to subsidise restaurants which provide reusable tableware with takeaway orders, saying it is the most direct means to cut down waste.

    China to hold anti-dumping hearing on European brandy

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry announced on Friday that it will hold an anti-dumping hearing on brandy imported from the European Union on July 18.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hearing will be about "industrial damage, cause and effect, and public interest in the anti-dumping probe of related brandy products", Xinhua News Agency quoted an online statement by the ministry as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing aims to ensure that the investigation procedure is fair, just and transparent, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's anti-dumping probe into EU brandy products would look at EU-produced brandy in containers holding less than 200 litres imported from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the ministry has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also investigate any damage done to the Chinese brandy industry from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe is expected to end before January 5, 2025, but may be extended for half a year under special circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement by the Commerce Ministry comes as the European Commission's provisional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) took effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has repeatedly called on the EU to cancel its EV tariffs, expressing a willingness to negotiate. It has said it does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, but that it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also opened investigations into European pork imports. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    'Everyone equal on reformed social workers body'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The new Social Workers Registration Board chairperson, Herman Hui, says he hopes to make sure the body stays on task. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760365_1_20240705121856.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new chairperson of the Social Workers Registration Board, Herman Hui, on Friday said he sees no differences between anyone on the reformed statutory body, whether they are appointed or elected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After taking an oath of allegiance to the SAR on Friday, Hui pledged to help the board stay on task, enhance the recognition and professional status of registered social workers, and make the board more transparent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the priorities will be establishing a mechanism to handle social workers convicted of national security crimes and other serious offences, Hui added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On whether people who have been convicted of serious offences are suitable to be social workers, we must make decisions based on the law. If the law says there are special circumstances, we will ask others on the board to consider if certain people are special cases and if they can continue to be registered as social workers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All but one of the elected board members recently resigned, but Hui said there's no difference between appointees and those who are voted onto the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the remaining elected board member is no different than the others. We are all serving the community and the board. I don't see any difference in that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another urgent matter for me to carry out immediately is to arrange for the coming term's elections to elect new members."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Lai, the sole remaining elected board member, said he believed Hui is capable of chairing the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had worked with him in some youth uniformed groups, and I thought he's a reasonable person. I hope he could lead the board out of this difficult situation," Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who's also a registered social worker, said the new appointees could help the statutory body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of them are actually very experienced social workers in the field. They have a lot of network," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They can give their experience to the board, and enhance the professional development of our board."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector legislator Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said prioritising the election of board members would make the body's structure more comprehensive.

    Legal sector set to benefit from CEPA, says CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Friday that the local legal profession is among sectors that will see greater development opportunities on the mainland once new liberalisation measures under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) are finalised.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More details will be announced once the two sides formally sign the new agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said CEPA reinforces the SAR's role as a bridge between the mainland and the rest of the world, adding that Hong Kong builds connections and encourages open trade as an international financial and legal hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech at a conference on international law and peaceful co-existence, he said implementation of the new CEPA agreement will also allow the SAR to contribute to the peaceful settlement of international disputes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legal practitioners from Hong Kong will have greater room to do business on the mainland. And that can only accelerate Hong Kong's rise as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region," the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now that's a good news story for our legal professionals and the sector in general."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that a traditional Chinese belief is that "peace is the most precious" thing, noting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of China pronouncing the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although seven decades have passed since the five principles were announced, they are still very much present, and needed, in today's turbulent world," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has appointed 12 new members to a statutory body overseeing social workers, with a lawyer named as its chairperson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, lawmakers passed a government bill to reform the Social Workers Registration Board, increasing the number of government appointees and requiring all members to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The board is being expanded from 15 to 27 members, with the number of appointees rising from eight to 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a government gazette on Friday, the administration appointed lawyer Herman Hui, who used to sit on a number of government committees, to chair the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grace Chan, the business director of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, will serve as the board’s deputy chairperson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other newly appointed members include an assistant director of the Social Welfare Department, Chan Chong-lai, and former permanent secretary for labour and welfare Annie Tam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Amy Chow, who heads the University of Hong Kong's department of social work and social administration, as well as members of the government's social welfare advisory committee, Frederick Lai and Barry Wong, are also among the new appointees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appointments were announced on Friday with immediate effect, and their term will last for three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said 18 board members pledged their allegiance to the SAR, while two others were unable to attend the ceremony due to other matters and would take their oaths later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The labour and welfare chief, Chris Sun, said the reformed board would more effectively safeguard public interest and national security, promoting the orderly development of the profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All but one of the existing elected board members recently resigned, including former chairman Ng Yut-ming.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan has attended a United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva, where he pointed out that Hong Kong had fulfilled its constitutional duty to enact local national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Acting as the deputy head of China's delegation, he noted that the One Country, Two Systems principle has been the cornerstone of the SAR's long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the meeting on Thursday, Chan said: "In March this year, with overwhelming support from the public and our Legislative Council, we finally fulfilled our constitutional duty to enact local legislation to safeguard national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the city's economy is growing and vibrant, and that since late 2022, government talent admission schemes had attracted more than 320,000 applications from all over the world. This, he said, served as a clear vote of confidence in the city's bright future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a government statement said the UN meeting discussed and formally adopted the review report on China, which includes contents about the Hong Kong SAR of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review of the Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review report of the working group covered a total of 428 recommendations raised with China by United Nations member states, including 24 pertaining to the SAR, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said that "the Hong Kong SAR government has been steadfastly joining the country in the review".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the territory has "actively responded to the views and suggestions about the human rights situation of the Hong Kong SAR from some countries, and sternly rebutted the unfounded and untrue remarks from a small number of countries".

    Murray tearful after Wimbledon doubles loss

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray suffered a losing start in his farewell to Wimbledon on Thursday, weeping openly in front of his adoring fans before admitting: "I wish I could play forever."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murray, a two-time singles champion at Wimbledon, and brother Jamie were defeated 7-6 (8/6), 6-4 by Rinky Hijikata and John Peers of Australia in the first round of men's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first episode of a retirement three-parter – the 37-year-old Murray is scheduled to play mixed doubles with Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon before he retires at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After having a metal hip inserted in 2019, suffering ankle damage this year and undergoing surgery to remove a cyst from his spine which ruled him out of singles at Wimbledon, Murray has reluctantly accepted the writing is on the wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His career has yielded three Grand Slam titles, two Olympic golds, a Davis Cup and the world number-one ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Look it's hard because I would love to keep playing but I can't. Physically it is too tough now, all of the injuries, they have added up and they haven't been insignificant," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tears flowed when video tributes were paid to Murray by a number of stars, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. (AFP)

    Labour set for landslide win in UK election: exit poll

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer – the working-class son of a toolmaker and a nurse – is set to replace Rishi Sunak as the UK's prime minister. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760320_1_20240705064605.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's main opposition Labour party looks set for a landslide election win, exit polls indicated on Thursday, ending 14 years of right-wing Conservative rule marked by financial austerity, Brexit division and scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As polling stations closed at 10:00 pm (2100 GMT), the survey for UK broadcasters suggested centre-left Labour would win 410 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, with the Tories (Conservatives) managing only 131.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another boost for the centrists, the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats would get 61 seats, but Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK could secure 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Counting of ballots was under way across the country, with official results expected from late on Thursday into Friday, putting Labour leader Keir Starmer on course to replace Rishi Sunak as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result, if confirmed, bucks a rightward trend among Britain's closest allies, with the far-right National Rally in France eyeing power and Donald Trump looking set for a return in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, a party needs 326 seats to win an overall majority in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a sleepless night of counting and declarations, the winner is expected to meet head of state King Charles, who will ask the leader of the largest party to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministerial appointments are expected to follow soon after an acceptance speech to a mass of assembled media in Downing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Confirmation of the result would cap a remarkable rise to power for Starmer, 61, who was first elected as a member of parliament in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former human rights lawyer and chief public prosecutor was elected Labour leader in early 2020, succeeding the veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, who lost by a landslide to Boris Johnson in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, he has dragged the party back to the centre ground, making it a more electable proposition and purging ideological infighting and anti-Semitism that lost it support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls have given Labour a consistent 20-point lead over the Tories for almost the past two years, which a largely lacklustre election campaign has failed to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That has given an air of inevitability about a Labour win, and high expectations that the party can fulfil its promise to change the country's flagging fortunes for the better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer – the working-class son of a toolmaker and a nurse – has promised "a decade of national renewal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his to-do list is daunting, with economic growth anaemic, public services overstretched and underfunded after nearly a decade-and-a-half of cuts, and households squeezed financially.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour leader has also promised a return of political integrity, after a chaotic period of five Tory prime ministers, including three in four months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first days in office are set to be packed, representing Britain at the Nato conference in Washington next week, then hosting European leaders later this month at a summit in southern England. (AFP)

    Mexico girds for hit from Hurricane Beryl

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourist resorts in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula girded on Thursday for a hit from Hurricane Beryl, which is still packing ferocious winds after slamming Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beryl dropped to a Category 2 storm, with winds of 175 kilometres per hour, and was expected to weaken further as it headed towards landfall overnight on Thursday into Friday on the peninsula, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of mid-afternoon on Thursday it was in the Caribbean about 445 kilometres east of Tulum, which is about a two-hour drive from Cancun – the two main resort cities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm already left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first hurricane since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach the highest Category 5 in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Mexico, classes in the area bracing for a hit were suspended and shelters were set up for locals and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Cancun, people have been stocking up on food and other essentials for days and hotels have boarded up their windows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl is expected to hit the Yucatan Peninsula, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then arrive in the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hurricane has already caused flash floods and mudslides in the Cayman Islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was "pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit," he said on Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Thursday he has agreed to send a delegation for talks on securing the release of hostages seized in the October 7 attacks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement after telephone talks with US President Joe Biden, Netanyahu's office said: "The prime minister updated President Biden about his decision to send a delegation that would continue negotiations for freeing the hostages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no indication where the delegation would go or when it would leave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its own readout of the phone call, the White House said Biden welcomed the decision to have Israeli negotiators "engage" with mediators in a bid "to close out the deal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu called a meeting of his security cabinet for later on Thursday to discuss new proposals sent by Hamas through Qatari mediators, media reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has demanded an end to the fighting and an Israeli withdrawal as a prelude to any hostage deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has countered that there can be no end to the war without the release of hostages in the Palestinian territory. Netanyahu has also repeatedly vowed that the Gaza campaign will not end until Hamas's military and government capabilities have been destroyed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said late on Wednesday that it had sent new "ideas" for a potential deal and Netanyahu's office said the government was "evaluating" them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been mediating between the two sides and sources close to their efforts said there had been a renewed push to bridge the "gaps" between the foes in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden announced a pathway to a truce deal in May which he said had been proposed by Israel and which included a six-week truce to allow for talks and eventually a programme to rebuild devastated Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are important developments in the latest proposals with positive options for both sides," said a diplomat briefed on the latest proposals. "This time the Americans are very serious about this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war started with the October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Lebanon's Hezbollah rains 200 rockets on Israel

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a barrage of more than 200 rockets and drones at Israeli army positions on Thursday as tensions soared amid the almost nine-month-old war raging in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Iran-backed militant group said its latest attack, which followed over 100 rockets fired the previous day, came in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in south Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel reported no deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with strikes in southern Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears of an escalation into all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres voiced concern on Wednesday "about the escalation of the exchange of fire," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, warning of the risk to the wider Middle East "if we were to find ourselves in a full-fledged conflict."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah and Hamas are part of an Iran-led "Axis of Resistance" against Israel and the United States, a regional alliance that also includes Yemen's Houthi rebels and armed groups in Iraq and Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military confirmed Hezbollah claims that over 200 rockets were launched on Thursday and said that its forces were "striking launch posts in southern Lebanon" in response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli air defences intercepted most incoming rockets, and the only reported casualty was a man slightly wounded by shrapnel, while some of the impacts sparked wildfires.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel killed senior Hezbollah commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser with a strike in the Lebanese coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source close to the group described him as "responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon." His death came after an Israeli strike in June killed Taleb Abdallah, who headed another sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at Nasser's funeral, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned Israel against "imagining that targeting these heroes would ever leave the south exposed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When any leader becomes a martyr, another takes up the banner and proceeds with new, firm and strong resolve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border. (AFP)

    British teacher jailed for sex with schoolboys

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The court heard that Rebecca Joynes had groomed the boys from the age of 15, and became pregnant by one of them.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A British teacher who had sex with two teenage students and had a baby with one of them was sentenced on Thursday to six and a half years in jail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rebecca Joynes, 30, was on police bail for sexual activity with one victim, identified as Boy A, when she began having sex with the second, Boy B, by whom she became pregnant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing Joynes, a judge said she had been a "high achiever" who had thrown her career away and had her baby taken away from her through her own actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joynes groomed the schoolboys from the age of 15, exchanging messages on social media before engaging in sexual activity, prosecutors told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was found guilty by a jury of six counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, including two while being in a position of trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither of the boys can be identified by name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence at Manchester Crown Court in northwestern England, Judge Kate Cornell told the former teacher she had behaved with "breathtaking arrogance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You were the person in control, the person who should have known better," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Instead, you abused that position of trust and exploited the privileged role for your own sexual gratification."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement to the court, Boy B said he had been "coerced and controlled, manipulated, sexually abused, and mentally abused" by Joynes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court previously heard that when police opened an investigation into her relationship with Boy A, she was warned not to have unsupervised contact with anyone under 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she then began a relationship with Boy B and later gave birth to his child. The baby was removed from her care within 24 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside court, Detective Constable Beth Alexander said there was still a lack of understanding about men and boys being the victims of sexual offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have had to read comments stating others are 'jealous' of them, and that they should be 'happy a young female teacher was interested in them', and this rhetoric is very damaging and dangerous", she told reporters.

 Jessica Pegula became the highest-ranked player to be dumped out of Wimbledon so far on Thursday, losing 6-4, 6-7 (7/9), 6-1 to China's Wang Xinyu in the second round.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American, ranked fifth in the world, battled back after losing the first set, saving a match point in the second-set tie-break, before levelling the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But China's 42nd-ranked Wang raced into a 5-0 lead in the decider before wrapping up the contest to record her first win against a top-10 player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, said: "Couple of days ago I was asking my coach, 'When will this happen?'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Jessica was really tough to play on grass. Her ball was super low and I'm just really happy I won in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang will face Britain's Harriet Dart, who defeated Nottingham champion Katie Boulter, for a spot in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova earlier this week became the first defending women's champion to lose in the first round for 30 years. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The dean of the University of Hong Kong's business school, Cai Hongbin, said at least 30 people had cheated their way into the school through the use of false documents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school revealed in May that it was investigating “a small number of people" who had secured admissions with fake degrees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with mainland media outlet Caixin on Thursday, Cai said the investigation has so far uncovered more than 30 people who got into the school fraudulently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He believes the number could reach 80 to 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cai said agencies that claimed to offer "guaranteed admission" had forged transcripts and diplomas from overseas universities, and that some students might have been kept in the dark about what had happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, police said they have arrested two women linked to the scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the suspects, 24, was charged with the use of a false instrument, while the case of another suspect, 34, was still under investigation. Both are mainland residents and two-way permit holders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday called on the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to ensure security in the face of real threat from the Cold War mentality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks when attending the SCO summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the member states to adhere to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, address complex and intertwined security challenges through dialogue and coordination, and respond to the profoundly changing international landscape with a win-win approach, so as to build a world of lasting peace and universal security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the world is faced with accelerating changes unseen in a century, the human society is standing at a crossroads of history again, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president pointed out that the SCO stands on the right side of history, fairness and justice, and is of great significance to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SCO members should consolidate unity and jointly oppose external interference in the face of the real challenges of interference and division, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasised the group's focus on ensuring security of its members, and said the SCO will form a dedicated centre that will coordinate response to various security challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the group's members will also endorse a special program to fight separatism and extremism. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Finnish conductor Tarmo Peltokoski has been named the new music director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil), succeeding Dutch maestro Jaap van Zweden from the 2026-27 season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old is the youngest director in the philharmonic's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his debut with the orchestra at a concert in June last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK Radio 4, Peltokoski compared the experience of leading the HK Phil to driving a luxury car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's absolutely world class. So it's a luxury car, so to say. I actually don't drive actual cars, but now I can drive the HK Phil. I was super impressed. We had our first rehearsal, and I'm excited for the years to come," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The award-wining composer studied piano at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, and is also interested in music comedy and improvisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2022, he was awarded “Principal Guest Conductor” of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen in Germany, the first conductor to hold the position in the orchestra’s 42-year history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Cogman, chairman of HK Phil's board of governors, said he is delighted to welcome the Finnish musician on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a remarkable and visionary musician, and we are very fortunate that he will write the next chapter in our orchestra’s history," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive of HK Phil, Benedikt Fohr, said the appointment of Peltokoski marked a significant milestone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a highly talented musician from the younger generation. Under his leadership, we wish to inspire a new generation of music lovers, and continue to enhance our artistic excellence and elevate our reputation in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested two women for allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O for crypto ransom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They received a report from a woman that her son was taken from a mall on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy was rescued by officers in the flat of one of the suspects on Thursday morning. He had no apparent injury and was sent to hospital for observation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the two suspects had financial difficulties. They also said there's no evidence they knew the boy's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that one of the suspects took the victim by force and moved him to a quieter place nearby, like a park, in a stroller. Another suspect put the kid in a suitcase and then moved him to the flat," said chief superintendent Kwan King-pan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said one of the suspects is an HKID holder and the other holds a two-way permit. Both are 38 and unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects asked the boy's family to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency possibly because it's harder to trace, but no ransom was paid.

    Govt to tender one residential site this quarter

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced that it will put only one residential site up for tender this quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A plot at Shiu Lek Yuen in Sha Tin is expected to generate 570 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the authorities will not be selling any commercial sites this quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also a hard fact that the vacancy rate for the commercial floor area in the economy is now on the high side. According to some recent statistics, it is around 13 percent. So, taking into account the market condition, we think we have a reason not to roll out commercial sites in this quarter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government's land sales, private property developments and urban renewal projects in the first two quarters will provide a total of 4,065 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will meet around one-third of the target of 13,200 units for this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to sell a total of eight residential sites this financial year, including six unsold sites from the previous land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Lands Department, only one piece of land was sold between April and June. The plot, which went for almost HK$82 million, will be used for a charging station for electric vehicles.

    Ladies only: KMB route driven solely by female drivers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In a first for Hong Kong, KMB has earmarked a bus route which will be served exclusively by female drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The franchised bus operator is also adding more female-friendly staff facilities in the hope of attracting more women to join its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting this month, KMB's route 69 between Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long will be handled by 11 female bus captains. A second such route is also on the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new resting room installed at the Tin Shui Wai terminus was also designed with female users in mind. It includes a changing room and a full-length mirror.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas Mak, head of operations at the company's Tuen Mun depot, said the bus operator is keen to smash a common stereotype that female drivers are not as good on the roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that women currently make up eight percent of KMB's 10,000 drivers. The company's goal is to increase this to 10 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taiwan-based airline STARLUX on Thursday said it aims to operate up to five daily round trips between the island and Hong Kong in the future.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its first flights between Hong Kong and Taipei will take off on July 16, with two round trips each day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tony Cho, the airline's mainland China chief representative and Hong Kong branch general manager, said the coming year is the right time to boost passenger flight frequency, when Chek Lap Kok's third runway comes into full operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is capable of increasing its manpower from the current 18 members of staff stationed in Hong Kong, Cho added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to compete with each other among this industry, but we also cooperate with them," he said. "We need more frequency to serve Taiwan and Hong Kong, and other areas for our business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In celebration of the new flights, a STARLUX-themed tram will run until the end of September, and there will be a sightseeing journey across Hong Kong Island later in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Tramways, which has partnered with the airline, said the collaboration will attract more tourists from Taiwan to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nixon Cheung, the tram operator's head of commercial and brand, said the public transport firm has seen a surge in passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have a great rebound during the past years, especially when we have many free ride days, that catered to a lot of customers, especially tourists flying from all over the world," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ocean Park Conservation Foundation on Thursday said it had retrieved the carcasses of two dolphins from Pui O Beach on Lantau, to try to find out why they died.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The foundation said one of the dolphins was a newborn, while the other was a severely decomposed adult of 2.4 metres in length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation urged people to report any stranded dolphins or whales to the 1823 government hotline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also called on people not to use shampoos or body washes while on boats, to prevent ocean pollution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s Assistant Scientific Manager, Dr Edgar Leung, estimated that the two Chinese white dolphins died over a week ago. He added that based on past experience, it will be almost impossible to find out the cause of their deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since 2006… we have investigated over 600 cetacean stranding cases altogether. However, most of the carcasses were found severely decomposed, like these two cases. Therefore, the cause of death is hard to determine. Only 10 percent of them can be addressed,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said possible causes of death include entanglement in fish nets or a bacterial infection. He said a necropsy will be carried out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Dolphin Conservation Society, Taison Chang, also said it will be very difficult to determine the cause of the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because mainly of the condition of the decomposed body. Most of the time, dead bodies recovered are very decomposed. So even if there is like a cut by a fishing line or a cut by propellers of a boat, the decomposed part, the body tissue, can easily mask the injury," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said more measures are on the way to make life easier for non-Chinese people in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came days after Beijing's move to allow non-Chinese permanent residents of the SAR to apply for a five-year mainland travel permit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the China Conference, hosted by the South China Morning Post, Lee hailed the new arrangement as a groundbreaking policy development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is actually a big policy breakthrough. The first step I have done to create convenience for non-Chinese friends in Hong Kong is that for any staff of a company set up in Hong Kong, there has been a fast-track procedure for them to apply for a visa to visit mainland China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So that is step one, and now we have step two, and there will be more steps coming. I hope I will deliver more to you in due course."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the measures underline Hong Kong's unique advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle, attracting companies and professionals to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong will continue to strengthen its competitiveness and role as a gateway between the mainland and global markets.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a force for global stability at a summit of the regional body in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their second meeting in as many months, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should "uphold the original aspiration of friendship for generations" in response to an "ever-changing international situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling Putin an "old friend", Xi alluded to the progress the two countries had made in putting in place "plans and arrangements for the next development of bilateral relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said the two sides should continuously conserve the unique value in China-Russia relations, and explore the internal driving force of bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Putin said the SCO has “firmly established itself as one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order", adding that bilateral ties between Moscow and Beijing were at their best in history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our cooperation is not aimed against anyone, we are not creating any blocs or alliances, we are just acting in the interests of our peoples," Putin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's spokesman later told state TV that the two leaders discussed Ukraine and agreed that peace talks without Russia's presence were futile. (Agencies)

    Alcaraz, Sinner through to Wimbledon's third round

<div class="itemFullText">
 Title rivals Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz reached the Wimbledon third round on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sinner defeated Italian Davis Cup teammate Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a three-hour 42-minute duel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berrettini, the 2021 runner-up, fired 65 winners, including 28 aces, past the top seed and carved out four breaks of serve to two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Sinner calmly recovered from a break down in the fourth set before playing the more composed tiebreak, which ended when Berrettini committed his 48th and final unforced error of the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very tough we had to face each other in the second round," said 2023 semi-finalist Sinner, who will take on Miomir Kecmanovic for a place in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz defeated Australia's world number 69 Aleksandar Vukic 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 6-2 on the back of 42 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Spaniard's only moments of concern came in the first set when he let slip a 5-2 lead and found himself 5-6 down with Vukic serving for the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the three-time major winner steadied the ship to race away to victory against a player who got the better of him in qualifying at the 2020 French Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz next faces fellow crowd-pleaser Frances Tiafoe, the American he defeated in five sets in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open on his way to his first Grand Slam triumph. (AFP)

    'Japan's forced sterilisation law unconstitutional'

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the law that aimed to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760168_1_20240704055209.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's top court ruled on Wednesday that a defunct eugenics law under which thousands of people were forcibly sterilised between 1948 and 1996 was unconstitutional.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court also declared that a 20-year statute of limitations could not be applied, paving the way for compensation claims from victims after years of legal battles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the state to evade responsibility for damages payments would be extremely unfair and unjust, and absolutely intolerable," the court in Tokyo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's government acknowledges that around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the law that aimed to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An additional 8,500 people were sterilised with their consent, although lawyers say even those cases were likely "de facto forced" because of the pressure individuals faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 1953 government notice said physical restraint, anaesthesia and even "deception" could be used for the operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who couldn't be here today. There are those who died as well. I want to visit the grave of my parents and tell them we've won," victim Saburo Kita, who uses a pseudonym, told reporters after the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kita was convinced to undergo a vasectomy when he was 14 at a facility housing troubled children. He only told his wife what had happened shortly before she died in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But a complete resolution of this issue hasn't been realised yet. Together with lawyers, I will continue to fight," said Kita, one of several victims who celebrated outside the court, some in wheelchairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of operations in Japan slowed to a trickle in the 1980s and 1990s before the law was scrapped in 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That dark history was thrust back under the spotlight in 2018 when a woman in her 60s sued the government over a procedure she had undergone at age 15, opening the floodgates for similar lawsuits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government, for its part, "wholeheartedly" apologised after legislation was passed in 2019 stipulating a lump-sum payment of 3.2 million yen (around US$20,000 today) per victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, survivors say that was too little to match the severity of their suffering and took their fight to court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional courts have mostly agreed in recent years that the eugenics law was a violation of Japan's constitution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, judges have been divided on whether claims are valid beyond the 20-year statute of limitations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some ordered the state to pay damages but others dismissed cases, saying the window for pursuing damages had closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the government would "swiftly pay damages based on the finalised ruling" and discuss "the new ways in which (victims) can be compensated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government "sincerely apologises" for the policy that "trampled on the human dignity" of victims, Kishida said, adding he would meet survivors in coming weeks to listen "face-to-face to their stories of suffering."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A group of victims said on Wednesday it "wholeheartedly" welcomed the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot forgive the irresponsibility of the government and its lack of human rights awareness, as well as the fact that what is now described as the biggest human rights violation in Japan's post-war history was left unaddressed for such a long time," the group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Koji Niizato said it was "the best ruling we could have hoped for."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victims of the eugenics law put up a wonderful fight, one that influenced the Supreme Court and changed society," Niizato said. (AFP)
