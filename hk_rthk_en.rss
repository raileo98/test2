 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said his cabinet had voted unanimously to close Qatari television network Al Jazeera's operations in Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities did not stipulate when the decision might take effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cabinet vote came after Israel's parliament passed a law allowing the temporary closure in Israel of foreign broadcasters considered to be a threat to national security during the war against Hamas in Gaza. (Reuters/AP)

    Clear Water Bay Road to fully open again by Monday
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said Clear Water Bay Road - which was partially closed due to a landslide - should be open again by rush hour on Monday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two-way traffic was sharing the same lane on a section of the road in Hang Hau on Sunday, after a slope measuring 30 metres long and 40 metres deep collapsed amid the torrential downpour the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Part of the pavement also caved in, showing underground pipes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After inspecting the area, Lam said workers were spraying concrete onto the slope, and more work would be carried out later to further consolidate the structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we open the road, we have to ensure it's safe after the temporary consolidation work. If we can't do that, we won't open the road," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we'll have measures in place. Our contractor and the Highways Department will keep monitoring the situation here. We'll also liaise with the observatory to see if the weather will worsen, and we've installed some sump pumps in case there's heavy rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities received 14 other landslide reports on Saturday, when the amber and red rainstorm warning signals were in effect for most of the day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging floods and mudslides this past week have killed at least 55 people in southern Brazil and forced nearly 70,000 to flee their homes, the country's civil defence agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said least 74 people were injured and another 67 were missing from the catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-rising water levels in the state of Rio Grande do Sul were straining dams and threatening the economically important city of Porto Alegre, home to some 1.4 million residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guaiba River, which flows through the city, was at a historic high of 5.04 metres, well above the 4.76 metres that had stood as a record since the devastating floods of 1941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities scrambled to evacuate swamped neighbourhoods as rescue workers used four-wheel-drive vehicles -- and even jet skis -- to move through waist-deep water in search of the stranded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence officials also said more than a million people lacked access to potable water amid the flooding, describing damage as incalculable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Otaegui shot a superb seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to come from five shots back to win the Volvo China Open and a place in the US PGA Championship in two weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard finished on a 54-hole total of 198, 18-under par, to win the weather-shortened event at Hidden Grace Golf Club in Shenzhen after Saturday's play was cancelled because of dangerous storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave him victory by one stroke from Italy's Guido Migliozzi, who carded a final-round 67.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-round leader Sebastian Soderberg of Sweden, who started five clear of Otaegui, saw the title slip from his grasp with a sorry double-bogey at the 18th when a par would have taken him into a playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished at 16-under par after a 72 alongside England's Paul Waring (69) and Switzerland's Joel Girrbach (67).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was starting five shots back so I just didn't look at the leaderboard, not think about the result. Just play my game," said Otaegui who won his fifth DP World (European) Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Otaegui's victory in the final event of the DP World Tour's Asian Swing secured a berth at the season's second major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla, beginning on May 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, that's very good news," said Otaegui when informed that he had finished third on the Asian Swing standings -- enough to get him into the next major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing some majors this year was a big goal for me," said the world number 143.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will just be enough time to rest a little bit at home next week and then head to America."

    People attempt bun tower climbing in Cheung Chau
   </title>
   <link>

   <description>
    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A climbing carnival took place at Cheung Chau on Sunday, ahead of the island's traditional bun-scrambling competition on Buddha's Birthday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-metre-high bun tower frame is already in place for the competition on May 15, and carnival-goers were given the chance to see whether they could climb it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung said her son had managed the feat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried bun scrambling over the years. When my son was young, he couldn't reach the top. Last time we came, he was able to get there at a slow pace with the help of his dad. But this time, he was able to do it all by himself very quickly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so happy to see him achieve that because yesterday it was raining really hard so I thought there wouldn't be a chance. Luckily the weather is beautiful. It's a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung's 13-year-old son has now climbed the tower at least four times. He gave his advice on the best way to approach the climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There isn't a specific technique to climbing. You just have to grasp the bamboo tightly and watch your footing. I love experiencing Hong Kong culture. I want to preserve and pass on Hong Kong culture like bun scrambling so more people know about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I personally love eating lucky buns and watching bun scrambling on television, so I really wanted to see if it is actually that exhilarating in person, and see if it's really that easy or difficult."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another visitor, Ms Lok, said she brought her friends from overseas to the carnival, so they could experience a bit of Hong Kong culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were shaking while climbing because the gaps are so small, but we had a lot of fun. Huge respect to those who can climb up so quickly. I think this is a great tradition to preserve, and I love the meaning behind it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can pass peace to anyone, even if you aren't Chinese. My friends wanted to experience something quite traditional and this definitely checks the box."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, workers have been working hard to reconstruct the three traditional giant bun towers for display ahead of next week's festivities, after Saturday's heavy winds caused the bamboo scaffolding to collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung Chi-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong Cheung Chau Bun Festival Committee, said it would take one to two days to complete, but progress was going well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never experienced the collapse of the bun tower scaffolding before. It was because the heavy winds hit it down. It is quite a rare incident. The latest situation is quite ideal. We thought it would take three to four days, but they've sent more people to help so the speed has increased significantly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at eight in the morning and everything has already been dismantled, and ready for reconstruction. I think everything can be restored in one to two days. I believe it will be reinforced this time around."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung also said the incident had incurred a cost, but he had not yet calculated how much money was involved. He added it was most important the Bun Festival runs smoothly next week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saul "Canelo" Alvarez retained his undisputed super-middleweight world title with a convincing unanimous decision over fellow Mexican Jaime Munguia on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez handed Munguia the first defeat in 44 professional bouts, dropping the 27-year-old challenger in the fourth round and inexorably taking control to improve to 61-2-2 in his storied career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges scored it 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112 for Alvarez, who retained his IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO belts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, whose 34 knockouts included victories inside the distance in four of his previous five fights, came out on the attack against the vastly experienced Alvarez, pushing him back with his jab and rattling the champion in the third round with a right to the jaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Alvarez responded in the fourth. After Munguia connected with a pair of solid rights Alvarez followed a left hook with a massive uppercut that sent Munguia to the canvas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth round opened to chants of "Canelo!" ringing in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, where support was evenly divided between the Mexican combatants in a fight coinciding with Mexico's Cinco de Mayo festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Alvarez jab popped Munguia's head back and, in the sixth, an Alvarez left hook had Munguia's knees buckling briefly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a fight billed as a possible changing of the guard, Munguia -- who has honed his aggressive style under the tutelage of longtime Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach -- continued to press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his vaunted power rarely bothered Alvarez, who repeatedly found away past Munguia's guard to land the more damaging blows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know, I take my time," Alvarez said of his measured start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a lot of experience. Jaime Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong. He's smart, but I take my time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have 12 rounds to win the fight, and I did. I did really good and I feel proud about it," added Alvarez, who hasn't posted a knockout since he stopped Caleb Plant in the 11th round in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez said that after a few rounds he could see everything that was coming from Munguia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's strong, but he's a little slow," Alvarez said. "I can see every punch." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian police said on Sunday they had shot dead a boy after he stabbed a man in Western Australia's capital Perth, in an attack authorities said indicated terrorism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were signs the 16-year-old, armed with a kitchen knife, had been radicalised online, state authorities said, adding they received calls from concerned members of the local Muslim community before the attack, which occurred late on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack, in the suburb of Willetton, had "hallmarks" of terrorism but was yet to be declared a terrorist act, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone," Western Australia Premier Roger Cook told a televised press conference in the state capital Perth, regarding the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victim, stabbed in the back, was stable in hospital, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the incident by police and intelligence agencies, which advised there was no ongoing threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia," Albanese said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's top IT office on Sunday said it was asking all bureaus and departments to comprehensively review their data security measures, and reply within a week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after reports of two data leaks in the past few days, involving the Companies Registry and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registry said on Friday the data of some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before, the EMSD apologised over the data leak of some 17,000 public housing residents who had to undergo mandatory Covid tests in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the issue on social media, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said it's highly concerned about the incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had again sent clear directives to the heads of bureaus and departments about the reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also reminded all users and systems under the departments that they must stringently comply with the government's rules, policies and guidelines on data security in handling sensitive and personal information," it said in the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office added this includes never storing data on publicly-owned cloud platforms.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says while adjustments will be made to the scheme, officials will try to minimise the effects on beneficiaries. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751866_1_L_20240505125439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said officials don't plan to change the eligible age and coverage of the HK$2 transport subsidy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government plans to complete a review of the scheme by the end of 2024, as its bill is expected to increase by 50 percent, to more than HK$6 billion this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said while there's a need to make changes to the scheme to ensure it is more financially viable in the long run, officials would keep several aspects of this "good policy" unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overriding principle is that the original intention of the scheme doesn't change - those benefiting from the scheme, that is elderly people aged 60 and above and the disabled, this won't change," the minister said on a TVB programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government did not plan to ban the more expensive bus and minibus trips to the border, saying beneficiaries have gotten used to the travel convenience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials would try their best not to make it troublesome for the beneficiaries, or affect their willingness to travel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that officials would do more to tackle abuses by those who are not eligible for the scheme, and do more promotion to encourage beneficiaries to take cheaper rides whenever possible.

    Golden Week tourists to boost city by HK$2 billion

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the total number of mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong should reach the estimated 800,000 mark with the Golden Week holiday wrapping up on Sunday, adding it would boost the economy by over HK$2 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said approximately 670,000 mainland tourists had already come to the territory in the first four days despite the rainy weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The entire Guangdong Province was affected by the unstable weather, and tourists can see that the weather is also not that good in Hong Kong, so they may postpone their trip. However, the overall numbers aren't bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that we will reach our estimated number of tourists. If we have around 800,000 mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong, I think we can earn over two billion dollars in consumption. Even though we have only reached about 700,000 people so far, we should still reach over two billion dollars."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the mixed reviews of the Labour Day pyrotechnic display, Yeung said it was no surprise that people had expectations for the fireworks show, but the weather was unpredictable in how it would affect the viewing experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rain is hard to predict, unlike wind which comes when it comes. Even if you see rain clouds, you don't know if it will actually rain. So up until 4pm of that day, we then decided it was appropriate to host the show," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was watching from the top of a bridge where the wind was hitting so from the start of the fireworks, the smoke did reach me. However, from other viewing angles, people have sent me clear and beautiful photos of the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added they would learn from this experience and do better in terms of publicity and expectation management in the future.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan is attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Tbilisi. Photo courtesy of Chan's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751862_1_L_20240505115210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong's economy was maintaining its momentum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan said the city’s GDP had increased five quarters in a row, with growth going up 2.7 percent year-on-year in the quarter ending in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market sentiment had also improved, he said, with the Hang Seng Index gaining almost 14 percent recently after going up for nine consecutive days, while the property market had become more active after measures to curb speculation were lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said inbound tourism was one of the key drivers of the economy in the first quarter, adding the number of arrivals during the first three days of Golden Week, which stood at nearly 650,000, was up 25 percent from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said external uncertainties remained, and that higher interest rates and a strong Hong Kong dollar would affect the city's tourism sector, as well as export and investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on companies to develop new products to explore new ways to manage their businesses, noting that authorities were helping SMEs to go digital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief, who was attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said many participants were interested in the development of the digital economy as well as the innovation and technology sector in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added authorities recently published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, to provide a clearer definition of green products and help the sector reduce "greenwashing" risks.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was a three-way thriller to the wire in the 150th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mystik Dan, ridden by Brian Hernandez, held on late to win a three-way photo finish by just a nose over Sierra Leone and Forever Young to capture the first leg of the Triple Crown on Saturday night in front of 156,710 fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's like a dream come true," Hernandez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sent off at odds of 18-1, Mystik Dan made the turn for home in front and stayed on the rail with Forever Young just to his outside and Sierra Leone on the far outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a gasp from the crowd as the three colts hit the finish line. It took several minutes for the racing stewards to look at the finish line photo and declare Mystik Dan the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- which is the closest margin you can have in horse racing -- and it was the first nose decision since Grindstone edged out Cavonnier in the 1996 Derby. (Reuters)

    Tax hike by US government 'likely': Buffett

<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett said he expects the US government to increase taxes to tackle widening fiscal deficits rather than reduce spending.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think higher taxes are likely," he said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They may decide that some day they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large because that has some important consequences. So they may not want to decrease spending and they may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we own, and we’ll pay it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in its latest long-term budget projections federal deficits will rise to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2054 from 5.5 percent in fiscal 2024. US budget deficits are expected to deteriorate if tax cuts introduced in 2017 are renewed next year. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland remained in the hunt to win the world rugby sevens series title after they came from behind to beat series leaders Argentina 21-5 in the quarterfinals in Singapore on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Americans could have been crowned regular season champions with a win at the National Stadium and they took the lead when Tobias Wade opened the scoring late in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Ireland hit back through Jordan Conroy just before half-time and tries after the interval by Terry Kennedy and Billy Davis secured their victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland have not finished higher than third in this season's series and would need to win the Singapore event while hoping Argentina lose to South Africa in the fifth-place play-off in order to clinch the series title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Conroy was delighted with his side's performance in the must-win game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was a very important game. It was the decider for who could possibly win the whole series, so we were really focused and worked hard and we got the result," said the 30-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we had lost, we would have been out of the title race. But now we've put ourselves in a really good position for tomorrow and we will get our teeth sunk in then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland's semi-final opponents on Sunday will be Great Britain who trounced France 35-7 in their quarterfinal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British were beaten 19-5 by Ireland in their opening pool game in Singapore but battled back to beat Fiji and the United States to secure their place in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other semi-final will feature Australia and New Zealand who came through a pair of hard-fought quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia squandered a 19-point lead against South Africa but came back to win 29-24 in extra time while New Zealand prevailed 19-14 against the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regular season winners of the sevens series will be decided in Singapore with the top eight teams going through to the grand final in Madrid later this month while the bottom four sides will compete in a promotion-relegation event to determine the core teams for next season's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, series co-leaders New Zealand and Australia remained on course for a showdown in Sunday's final after they maintained their perfect records in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand topped their pool with emphatic wins against Ireland, Canada and Spain before seeing off Great Britain 24-5 in the quarter-finals while Australia beat Fiji, Great Britain and Brazil in pool play and sealed their place in the last four with a 24-14 win over Ireland.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour leader Keir Starmer has hailed a swing to Labour, just five years after the party was trounced by the Conservatives.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's ruling Conservatives on Saturday braced for further losses in local elections, their worst results in recent memory and a key test before a general election to be held by January.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party lost nearly 500 councillors and control of 12 councils as well as a parliamentary seat, after voting on Thursday across a swathe of England saw the Labour opposition make huge gains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The beleaguered Tory leader faces more likely defeats when results of crunch mayoral races -- in London, Liverpool and Manchester -- are announced later, but is hoping to retain the West Midlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare success on Friday, a Tory mayor won a third term in Tees Valley, northeast England -- albeit with a vastly reduced majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, out of power since 2010 and trounced by Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election in 2019, seized on its claim to the Blackpool South seat in parliament and other successes to demand a national vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's turn the page on decline," Labour leader Keir Starmer told supporters on Saturday in the East Midlands, where the party won the mayoral race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak must order a general election be held by January 28 next year at the latest, and has said he is planning on a poll in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Sunak conceded the returns showed "voters are frustrated" but insisted "Labour is not winning in places they admit they need for a majority".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We Conservatives have everything to fight for," Sunak concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for all of Sunak's 18 months in charge, as previous scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and various other issues dent the Tories' standing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, they were defending nearly 1,000 council seats, many secured in 2021 when they led nationwide polls before the implosion of Johnson's premiership and his successor Liz Truss's disastrous 49-day tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With almost all those results in by Saturday morning, they had lost close to half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If replicated in a nationwide contest, the initial tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points, according to the BBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky News' projection for a general election using the results predicted Labour will be the largest party but short of an overall majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its by-election scalp in Blackpool -- on a mammoth 26-percent swing -- was the Conservatives' 11th such loss in this parliament, the most by any government since the late 1960s. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland scored four times as Manchester City thrashed Wolves 5-1 to move within one point of Arsenal after the Premier League leaders beat Bournemouth 3-0 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  City responded to Arsenal's victory just hours earlier with a goal blitz at the Etihad Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's side took the lead in the 12th minute when Rayan Ait-Nouri clattered into Josko Gvardiol, conceding a penalty that Haaland stroked past Jose Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland bagged City's second in the 35th minute as he rose highest at the far post to meet Rodri's cross with a majestic header that looped over Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deep into first half stoppage-time, Nelson Semedo tripped Haaland to give City another penalty that was drilled home by the Norway striker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hwang Hee-chan got one back for Wolves in the 53rd minute after a mistake by City keeper Ederson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Haaland curled a fine finish into the far corner in the 54th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez's 85th minute finish capped City's sixth consecutive league win, extending their unbeaten run in the competition to 20 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reigning champions, who have a game in hand on Arsenal, will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last three matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They head to Fulham next Saturday before visiting Tottenham on May 14 and hosting West Ham five days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal cruised to a fourth successive victory, with Bukayo Saka's penalty putting them ahead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard slotted past Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers in the 70th minute before Declan Rice capped a dominant display by blasting home in stoppage-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chasing their first title since 2004, Arsenal's 26th Premier League victory this season equalled the club's top-flight record for a single campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was probably the best first half we've played all season," Gunners boss Mikel Arteta said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were unbelievable. Everything flowing, super composed on the ball. We generated so many chances, we could have gone three, four, five up easily."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal travel to Manchester United in their penultimate game next weekend before hosting Everton on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a huge blow as Newcastle ran riot in a 4-1 win at Turf Moor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vincent Kompany's second bottom side are five points from safety, with only two games left to avoid an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Callum Wilson put Newcastle ahead with a 19th minute tap-in and Sean Longstaff doubled their advantage in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Guimaraes made it three in the 40th minute with a powerful strike before Arijanet Muric saved Alexander Isak's 50th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isak made amends five minutes later when he grabbed his 20th league goal this season, making Dara O'Shea's 86th minute header no consolation for bedraggled Burnley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Bramall Lane, fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial breaches, are three points ahead of third bottom Luton, who drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West London rivals Brentford and Fulham shared a dour 0-0 draw. (AFP)

    Ipswich back in Premier League after 22 years

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751824_1_L_20240504225137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ipswich returned to the Premier League for the first time in more than two decades after beating Huddersfield 2-0 to secure promotion from the Championship on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Wes Burns and Omari Hutchinson ensured the Tractor Boys became just the fourth side in the Premier League era to go from the third to the top tier via consecutive promotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds needed an Ipswich defeat coupled with victory over Southampton to leap into the top two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Daniel Farke's men lost 2-1 to Saints at Elland Road, meaning he will come up against old club Norwich in the playoff semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's most famous fan Ed Sheeran, who sponsors the club's shirts, was not in attendance for wild scenes of celebration at Portman Road as fans poured on to the pitch and lit blue flares at full-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Suffolk club, which was sold to American investors for just 40 million pounds (HK$391.96 million), will now pocket at least 200 million pounds in television revenue in the coming years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's rise was masterminded by boss Kieran McKenna, who has earned rave reviews in his first managerial role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenna failed to make the grade as a Tottenham player due to a hip injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 37-year-old thrived as a youth academy coach with Tottenham and then Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was promoted to help coach United's first-team by Jose Mourinho and retained that role under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford before joining Ipswich in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot, mostly seeing how much it means to everyone, the players, the supporters. To be one of the leaders of that is absolutely massive," McKenna said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a wonderful day, I'm very proud of everyone involved. It's what we've done all year. It's an incredible amount of effort." (AFP)

    Canelo and Munguia make weight ahead of title bout

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The commemorative boxing belt for the fight between Saul ''Canelo'' Alvarez and Jaime Munguia in Mexico City. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751812_1_L_20240504184541.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undisputed super-middleweight world champion Saul "Canelo" Alvarez and unbeaten Jaime Munguia both made weight Friday for their world boxing title showdown in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez, who will put his four super-middleweight belts on the line on Saturday, weighed in at 166.8 pounds (75.6kg) while fellow Mexican Munguia tipped the sales at 167.4 pounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighters greeted each other with respect on the stage in front of the T-Mobile Arena, where thousands of fans turned out to record the spectacle with their cell phones to the sound of mariachi music.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel really good," Alvarez said. "I feel in my prime. I feel in my best, because I've got no injuries anymore, so I feel my best right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll show you guys on Saturday night. I'm in my best shape -- ever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old champion had surgery on his left hand in 2022 after suffering the second loss of his career, against Dmitry Bivol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then,Alvarez has won three straight decisions but he hasn't added to his tally of knockouts and brings a record of 60-2-2 with 39 knockouts to the bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fight marks Alvarez's first since 2017 against a Mexican opponent, who has drawn plenty of fans himself for the bout coinciding with the Cinco de Mayo holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, who boasts a record of 43-0 with 34 knockouts, vowed to make the most of his opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I'm going to be world champion," said the 27-year-old from Tijuana, who has honed an explosive style under the guidance of trainer Freddie Roach, long-time trainer of Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promoters have hyped the encounter as a potential changing of the boxing guard, with Munguia poised to dethrone an opponent who made his professional debut way back in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unsurprisingly, Alvarez -- and oddsmakers -- see it differently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't care about experiences versus youth, I'm Canelo," Alvarez said this week, predicting a "decisive" victory in defence of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO world titles. (AFP)

    Care teams deployed after heavy rain hits Sai Kung
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said 12 care teams have been deployed to Sai Kung in response to the severe rainfall that hit the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At one point, the Observatory recorded over 200 millimetres of rain in the district, causing significant flooding on several roads, including Po Lam Road North and Wan Po Road in Tseung Kwan O, as well as Pak Sha Wan Street in Sai Kung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home affairs minister said some care team members were already on duty in temporary shelters while others were checking the district for floods and reporting to the Sai Kung district officer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also dismissed claims that some care team members didn't turn up when the rain was at its hardest on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Care team members are volunteers and they are fully dedicated to their work. However, during periods of heavy rainfall and when there are floods, the responsibility for addressing standing water and flooding falls to the government's professional departments,” she said. “I think the general public don’t expect care teams to deal with the floods without the necessary equipment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that most floods in the district had been dealt with before noon and most roads affected had been reopened by 2 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the Home Affairs Department had opened nine temporary shelters across Hong Kong for people in need of temporary accommodation.

    Turkey halts trade with Israel until Gaza ceasefire

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey said on Friday it will not resume trade with Israel, worth US$7 billion a year, until a permanent ceasefire and humanitarian aid are secured in Gaza, becoming the first of Israel's key commercial partners to take such a step.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's "uncompromising attitude" and the worsening situation in Gaza's Rafah region, a refuge for displaced people that Israel has threatened to storm - prompted Ankara to halt all exports and imports, Trade Minister Omer Bolat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz criticised Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's move, enacted late on Thursday, saying it breaks international trade agreements and was "how a dictator behaves".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, praised the decision as brave and supportive of Palestinian rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Turkey curbed exports of steel, fertiliser and jet fuel among 54 product categories over what it said was Israel's refusal to allow Ankara to take part in aid air-drop operations for Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new ban covers all remaining trade, amounting to US$5.4 billion in Turkish exports - or nearly 6 percent of all of Israel's imports - and US$1.6 billion in imports to Turkey last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top Turkish exports to Israel are steel, vehicles, plastics, electrical devices and machinery, while imports are dominated by fuels at US$634 million last year, Turkish trade data show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey has denounced Israel's military campaign in Gaza, sent thousands of tons of aid for Gazans and, this week, said it would join South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel denies committing acts of genocide in Gaza or violating humanitarian law there. (Reuters)

    Biden awards Yeoh with top US civilian honour

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday awarded the country's top civilian honour to Oscar-winning Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh and 18 other people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a ceremony at the White House, the 81-year-old Biden presented Yeoh and other winners with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by placing the award around their necks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House praised Yeoh for continuing to "shatter stereotypes and enrich American culture," as the 61-year-old actress became the first Asian woman to win the best actress Oscar for her performance in "Everything Everywhere All at Once" last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners of the Presidential Medal of Freedom include Biden's Democratic allies - former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, former vice president Al Gore, former secretary of state John Kerry, and former New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the winners have made exemplary contributions to the US, and the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are the pinnacle of leadership in their fields. They consistently demonstrated over their careers the power of community, hard work, and service." Biden said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the amber rainstorm warning signal at 8.45pm on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said heavy rain over Hong Kong had started to ease. The Observatory had issued the amber signal to replace the red rainstorm warning just before 4pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the forecaster has also warned that another intense band of thundery showers is edging towards the Pearl River Estuary, and this might still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The red signal had been in place since about 9 am and, at around noon, the Observatory warned it might issue its maximum black signal as even heavier rain started to fall across Hong Kong, especially in the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Drainage Services Department said it mobilised about 70 emergency response teams to handle flooding, involving over 160 emergency response teams comprising about 600 people. It said that by 7.30pm, all 16 flooding cases, including 12 in the Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O areas, had been resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geotechnical Engineering Office said it received 15 reports of landslides in the Sai Kung area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fire Services Department said that as of 7pm it had handled 25 reports of people trapped in lifts, and 71 reports from automatic fire alarm systems. It said fourteen people were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it received 22 reports of fallen trees with no injuries as of 8pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Home Affairs Department said it had opened nine temporary shelters located in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City in Kowloon, and Tseung Kwan O and Sai Kung in the New Territories.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday rescued two groups of hikers near Sai Kung, as heavy rain fell over Hong Kong, particularly in the east.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a group of 11 mainland tourists, including seven children, contacted police at about 11.30 am, after finding themselves stranded at High Island Reservoir East Dam. They had previously been camping in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about the same time, rescuers were also called in by four local hikers who found themselves in difficulty on section two of the MacLehose Trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said they were able to locate all of the stranded hikers, and evacuate them, adding that none of the 15 were injured and that they didn't require hospital treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory issued the first Red Rainstorm Signal of the year just before 9 am, before saying it was considering issuing the higher Black Rainstorm Signal at around noon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.30 am, the forecaster also issued a Landslip Warning, reminding people to stay away from steep slopes, and to stay at home.

    Dozens of cars damaged as TKO car park floods

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of cars were damaged by flood water at a car park in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday, as heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong, leading the Observatory to consider issuing a Black Rainstorm Warning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “For that particular outdoor car park area, there are around 450 cars. I think half of the cars were seriously [flooded]," said district councillor Christine Fong in an interview with RTHK. "Some of them, the water was up over the tyres, even up to the engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong also said the car park, on Wan Po Road in Lohas Park, didn't have a reputation for flooding so many drivers had been caught out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the east of the SAR had borne the brunt of the rainfall with over 200 millimetres of rain falling in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Road flooding in those two areas also meant that only limited services could be provided at two out-patient clinics there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department says it has opened temporary shelters for people in need of temporary accommodation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Observatory had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am following a night of rain, leading to the suspension of classes at all schools.

    New minimum wage formula to protect labour: Sun
   </title>
   <link>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said the new minimum wage formula will provide support to Hong Kong's 17,000 low income workers, who currently earn an hourly rate of HK$40.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new formula - which bars any reduction - takes effect next year, after being given the go-ahead on Tuesday by the Chief Executive, John Lee, and the Executive Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the reform balanced the interests of both labour and employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has taken into account, on the one hand, the need to protect those earning a minimum wage, that their wage is being protected; and also, at the same time, to ensure that the formula is affordable, and also acceptable to the business sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the labour minister told an RTHK radio programme that the government would enhance safety awareness following the deaths of two sewer maintenance workers, who are believed to have been exposed to toxic gas in a manhole last week in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stated that new guidelines for those working in confined spaces, to be announced this month, will make it mandatory to install CCTV at the entrance and exit of manholes.

    Restaurants see 10pc drop in business on May 1 holiday
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Catering sector representative Simon Wong on Saturday said restaurants saw 10 percent less business than usual this May 1 public holiday, which was also the first day of the mainland's Golden Week break.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades president said this was partially due to 20,000 fewer mainland arrivals on that day, although the May 1 firework display had helped trade near Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see that business in some areas in Hong Kong - like in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, and along the harbour - because of the fireworks, recorded some increase," he said. "I did visit several districts in Hong Kong and saw that there were not too many people visiting shopping malls.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that reduced spending power among individual travellers and the bad weather during the week contributed to the lower sales. He also attributed the lower sales to many locals heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a hotel group says the occupancy rate for its two hotels also dropped about six to seven percent when compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Chan, the operations officer of Miramar Group, said the group had offered substantial price discounts to retain hotel guests, with prices per night decreasing by approximately 23 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the hotel industry, if we need to drop prices by 23 percent to retain a certain occupancy rate, I think it’s not really ideal,” he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that this year, many mainland flights had resumed to other countries, and visa requirements had also been relaxed for mainlanders, giving them more travel options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan urged the government to liaise with mainland authorities to further expand the Individual Visit Scheme so more mainlanders could visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day mainland holiday will conclude on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Immigration Department, arrivals on May 1 reached 460,000, with over 180,000 coming from the mainland.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday said it may issue the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, as heavy rain continues to batter Hong Kong, particularly in the east of the territory. It had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am, as the rainy weather that has hit Hong Kong over the past few days worsened.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O have seen very heavy rain with the Observatory saying more than 200 millimetres have been recorded and that severe rainstorms would continue to affect the eastern part of the SAR. It also warned people to stay away from watercourses across the territory due to the possibility of flash floods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Hospital Authority spokesman for the Kowloon East Cluster said road flooding meant only limited services could be provided at the Mona Fong General Out-patient Clinic in Sai Kung and the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the government had called on the public to report flooding to the Drainage Services Department following wet weather overnight. There have been reports of flooding and a fallen tree in Chai Wan, and flooding on Silver Cape Road in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools have also been told to make sure conditions are safe before allowing students to leave, while all classes have been suspended for the afternoon
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also told employers to make arrangements for staff.

    Hui flags SAR's strength as a wealth management centre

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says that the government is taking steps to enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness as a wealth management and capital formation centre in order to consolidate the city's position as a leading global financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address programme, he noted that one of the key measures introduced was the Capital Entrant Admission Scheme, which allows individuals with capital of more than HK$30 million to become permanent residents after residing in in Hong Kong for seven years. This scheme has received a positive response, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He discussed efforts to facilitate capital formation, including the reduction of stamp duty for the stock market and the reform of the Growth Enterprise Board, which focuses mainly on small and medium-sized enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a very competitive edge as the equity and also bond raising platform for different corporates. So in that context, we have a number of measures laid out and actually implemented phase by phase to enhance the appeal of our capital market," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stressed that amid global geopolitical changes, people are looking for ways to diversify their assets, adding that Hong Kong can seize the opportunities arising from these challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the city is a very attractive option for individuals to invest their capital and channel investments through Hong Kong to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a wealth management and capital formation centre was evident with more than 2,700 single-family offices already established in the city.

    HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training
   </title>

   <description>
    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) is launching a new round of its overseas training sponsorship programme, fully subsidising eligible participants to earn a bachelor's degree in podiatry at the University of Northampton in the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The scheme to send people abroad for training on foot treatment was first introduced in 2005 due to the lack of recognised programmes among local tertiary institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stanley Wan, who works as a resident podiatrist at Yan Chai Hospital, participated in the programme in 2014 and joined the HA in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had graduated with an engineering degree, but decided to switch to a new career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In terms of my profile, I think I'm not really as good as other competitors, which could possibly already have a degree related to chemistry or bio-engineering,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think I showed the interviewer that I have great determination of preparing myself. I applied for the course of physiology, trying to learn something that I probably [did not] know before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also I participated in my church activities, which mainly serve the elderly.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two or three places are on offer each year, and successful applicants must commit to working for the HA for at least five years upon graduation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priscilla Poon, the HA's chief manager of allied health, said applicants actually find the requirement attractive because Hong Kong doesn't have its own podiatry registration process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it's a kind of encouragement to them… For those graduates who have graduated in the UK – despite the fact that they are able to register in the UK – [but because] there’s no registration in Hong Kong, there won't be any guarantee of job opportunities,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But if we ask them to serve in HA at least for five years, I think that will be a very positive message for them… they're still able to get a very good pay and a very good job opportunity in HA.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poon said the HA currently employs 54 podiatrists, but lost about 5 percent of staff each year in recent years due to retirement or resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while the current staff level is sufficient, Hong Kong's ageing population is expected to increase the demand for podiatrists further.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street surged to a higher close on Friday as a softer-than-expected employment report bolstered the case for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve while also providing evidence of US economic resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock posted robust gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the pack, rising 2 percent with an assist from Apple shares following the iPhone maker's record share buyback announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes notched their second straight Friday-to-Friday gains, capping a week in which markets were encouraged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's more dovish-than-expected statements following Wednesday's rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's employment report showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked higher and wage growth unexpectedly cooled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report likely hit the sweet spot for the Fed, offering signs the labor market is softening, which Powell has deemed necessary to put inflation on a sustainable downward path. The report also provided assurances on US economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report prompted investors to raise bets the Fed would implement its first rate reduction in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investor narrative remains the Fed and interest rates and today’s weak jobs report puts rate cuts firmly on the Fed’s 2024 agenda," said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments in New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials weighed in on the data. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her willingness to hike rates if inflation progress reverses, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the employment report boosted confidence the economy is not overheating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple surged 6.0 percent, after the company unveiled a record US$110 billion share buyback program and beat quarterly expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travel platform Expedia cut its full-year revenue growth forecast, sending its shares sliding 15.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18 percent, to 38,676, the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent, to 5,128 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.99 percent, to 16,156. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police said on Friday they had arrested and charged three Indian nationals with the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 and said they were probing possible links to the Indian government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said the matter was still under investigation and other probes were being carried out. These "include investigating connections to the government of India," he told a televised news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a "terrorist".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States. (Reuters)

    Lakers ditch Ham after playoff thumping

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Darvin Ham's prayers were not answered as his team crashed out of the playoffs. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751714_1_L_20240504034454.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Los Angeles Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on Friday after two seasons and a 90-74 regular-season record.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We greatly appreciate Darvin's efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons including last year's remarkable run to the Western Conference finals," general manager Rob Pelinka said in a team-released statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all want to thank Darvin for his dedication and positivity. While this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season. This organisation will remain unwavering in its commitment to deliver championship-calibre basketball to Lakers fans around the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers finished the regular season with a 47-35 mark, good enough for only an eighth-place finish in the Western Conference. They defeated the New Orleans Pelicans in the play-in round to earn the No 7 seed in the playoffs but were bounced by the Denver Nuggets in the opening round, 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets also defeated the Lakers last season in the conference finals on the way to their first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had seemed optimistic in Lakers land when the team roared to the title in the NBA in-season tournament with a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers at Las Vegas on December 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a 3-9 stretch followed, and reports emerged of growing unrest between the players and Ham, 50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers hired Ham on June 3, 2022, to replace Frank Vogel following a 33-49 record in 2021-22, two years removed from winning the NBA championship. It was Ham's first NBA head coaching job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lakers fans chanted "Fire Darvin Ham" in Game 3 of the series with the Nuggets. After the game, All-Star Anthony Davis said the Lakers "don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor" for stretches of games. (Reuters)

    Flood-ravaged Kenya braces for first ever cyclone

    <![CDATA[<img alt="William Rutto warns in an address to the nation that Kenya's severe weather is likely to continue. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751706_1_L_20240504012715.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and landslides across Kenya in recent weeks, killing at least 210 people, are forecast to worsen over the rest of this month, President William Ruto said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The floods have wreaked havoc, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure across Kenya, East Africa's largest economy. The death toll exceeds that from floods triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon late last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sadly, we have not seen the last of this perilous period, as the situation is expected to escalate. Meteorological reports paint a dire picture," Ruto said on Kenyan television. "Kenya may face its first-ever cyclone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclone Hidaya is expected to make landfall in Tanzania, Kenya's southern neighbour, on Saturday, bringing with it waves almost eight metres high and 165 kph winds, the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Floods have killed more than 160 people in Tanzania since the beginning of April, Tanzania's government spokesman Mobhare Matinyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This cyclone, named Hidaya, that could hit anytime now, is predicted to cause torrential rain, strong winds and powerful and dangerous waves," Ruto said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Ruto ordered those living in landslide-prone areas to leave for safer ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has asked people living near 178 dams and water reservoirs, now close to overflowing, as well as those in informal settlements close to rivers and streams, to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said the reopening of all schools for the upcoming term, which was meant to start this week, would be postponed until further notice. (Reuters)

 Uefa have agreed to increase squad sizes from 23 to 26 players for the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, European football's governing body said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  International managers had voiced concerns when a return to the pre-Covid-19 23-player limit had been confirmed by Uefa, after it was increased to 26 for Euro 2020 and World Cup 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Uefa Executive Committee has today decided to increase the maximum squad size of the teams participating in the upcoming Uefa Euro 2024 from the original quota of 23 to 26 players," a Uefa statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The increase does not represent an obligation for the participating national associations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participating countries have until June 7 to provide Uefa with a squad list containing a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26. (Reuters)

    US job growth slows, boosting rate cut hopes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The jobs report raised hopes of cuts to interest rates. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751704_1_L_20240504011035.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0 percent for the first time in nearly three years, but it is probably too early to expect that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates before September as the labour market remains fairly tight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in March amid increasing labour supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless, the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for the 27th straight month. Data this week showed job openings declining in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the US central bank could after all engineer a "soft-landing" for the economy and doused chatter of stagflation, which had been fanned by news of a sharp moderation in economic growth and a surge in inflation in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Financial markets boosted the odds of a September rate cut and saw the Fed reducing borrowing costs twice this year instead of only once before the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A cooler pace of hiring to a more sustainable pace should be interpreted as beneficial with respect to the inflation outlook going forward and remove any lingering concerns of a wage price spiral and put to bed loose and undisciplined talk from the corners of the trading community about stagflation," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month, the fewest in six months, the Labour Department's Bureau of Labour Statistics said. Revisions showed 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than previously reported.  (Reuters)

    HSBC not planning more asset sales: chairman

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC has no current plans to sell more assets, its chairman Mark Tucker said on Friday at the annual shareholder meeting of the bank, which has scaled back its presence in Western markets in recent years as part of a sweeping overhaul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HSBC shareholders met in London days after the bank's CEO Noel Quinn announced his surprise retirement following a five-year tenure which saw HSBC sell retail banking operations in France and the US, and its entire Canadian unit, as it pivots towards Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman's comments hint at a likely shift in direction for whomever succeeds Quinn, as the bank turns its focus away from shrinking its global empire to trying to grow its business in its remaining markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shareholders, as expected, backed a resolution to lift a cap on the size of bonuses HSBC can pay its top UK bankers, after Britain axed a policy limiting payouts that it had inherited from the European Union. Goldman Sachs is removing the cap and other banks are expected to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to shareholders at the meeting, Tucker also said HSBC was in a strong position to continue paying robust dividends despite an uncertain global economic outlook and central bank policy moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank, which returned US$19 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share buybacks, has announced a further US$8.8 billion so far for 2024, and is targeting a dividend payout ratio of 50 percent this year, Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has been able to splash out on such shareholder rewards in recent years as rising central bank interest rates have boosted its lending income, turbo-charging its profits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation remains key to the global interest rate outlook, Tucker said. HSBC economists forecast that global inflation will fall gradually to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 3.8 percent in 2025, having climbed as high as 6.3 percent in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank expects the European Central Bank and Bank of England to cut rates in June, both lowering by 150 basis points by the end of 2025, and expects the US Federal Reserve to cut in September, cutting by 100 basis points by the same time. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Companies Registry on Friday said the personal information of around 110,000 people had been leaked due to a fault in its digital platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The registry said if people conduct searches on its e-Services Portal and pressed the F12 key, they might see additional personal details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Information being exposed included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, as well as full identity and passport numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body said urgent maintenance has been carried out to prevent further leaks, and that it is getting in touch with and apologising to those affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it is consulting the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer with a view to conducting a comprehensive review of the incident and taking further enhancement measures to safeguard personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog, for its part, said it is launching a probe given the number of people affected in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department apologised after information of around 17,000 public housing tenants required to undergo Covid tests in 2022 was exposed online.

  Polytechnic University researchers spoke to around 2,600 grassroots teenagers, who joined the first phase of the Strive and Rise programme that paired them with mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The junior secondary students on average gave themselves a score of 4.22 out of 6 on financial planning after completing the year-long programme late last year – 12 percent higher than before they joined the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey also showed the teenagers describing themselves as becoming more confident, feeling a greater sense of belonging, as well as developing stronger interpersonal skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference summing up the first phase of the programme, one of the participants, Li Ching-po, said he learnt how to make small talk when meeting someone new.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that he had used the HK$10,000 allowance provided by the programme to pay for his violin lessons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the support and encouragement from my mentors, I found my dream of becoming a great violin teacher," he said. "I hope I'll become an accomplished violinist and fulfil my dream."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who had been overseeing the programme, said he was happy to see the participants' growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He brushed aside criticism that some teenagers did not get to see their mentors often.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that not every mentor has a lot of free time on their hands. [But] they signed up on their own, and I believe they wanted to do this and knew they had to devote some of their time. Our records show that the mentors and participants met 12 times a year on average," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can say that most of our mentors were very responsible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the government wants to keep the scheme running, and serve a total of 12,000 participants by the year 2025-2026.

    Sha Tin trunk road plan gets Legco green light

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Legislative Council’s Finance Committee on Friday approved a funding request for a controversial HK$6.8 billion plan to build a new trunk road in Sha Tin to relieve traffic in the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sixty-one lawmakers voted in favour of the plan and three voted against, with 12 abstentions after a four-hour meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The estimated cost of the “Trunk Road T4” project was lowered by around five percent from the original HK$7.1 billion after concerns were raised over its hefty price tag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan is to build a dual two-lane trunk road of around 2.3 kilometres and connect major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung told the Legco meeting that the trunk road is needed to cope with the growing population in New Territories East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The population of New Territories East is expected to increase further. Trunk Road T4 is therefore important in the context of the overall transport infrastructure planning and also serves a regional function," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And it is anticipated that the major roads network in New Territories East will gradually not be able to meet the transport and logistics needs in the short-to-medium term."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a number of legislators, including Peter Koon from the Election Committee, questioned whether the plan is needed or is worth the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we have monetary resources, of course it'd be okay. However, when the government budget is in the red, when we need to solve traffic congestion problems in peak hours, can we really solve the problem? If we need to resolve the bottleneck in Sha Tin and you're simply moving the bottleneck to elsewhere, other areas will still be affected,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who represents the New Territories South East, also had reservations about the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This T4 road actually is a bit out of budget and it's not a suitable time to build. We have to strike a balance between how to control the expenditure of the government and the needs of the residents there,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said they’ve already scrapped a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reduced the number of elevators at footbridges to minimise costs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Long March-5 rocket, carrying the Chang'e-6 spacecraft, blasted off from its launchpad at the Wenchang Space Launch Site in Hainan on Friday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's mysterious far side, the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Collecting and returning samples from the far side of the moon is an unprecedented feat. Now we know very little about the moon's far side. If the Chang'e-6 mission can achieve its goal, it will provide scientists with the first direct evidence to understand the environment and material composition of the far side of the moon, which is of great significance," said Wu Weiren, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chief designer of China's lunar exploration program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 spacecraft, like its predecessor Chang'e-5, comprises an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After it reaches the moon, it will make a soft landing on the far side. Within 48 hours after landing, a robotic arm will be extended to scoop rocks and soil from the lunar surface, and a drill will bore into the ground. Scientific detection work will be carried out simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the samples are sealed in a container, the ascender will take off from the moon and dock with the orbiter in lunar orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The returner will then carry the samples back to Earth, landing in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The entire flight is expected to last about 53 days, the China National Space Administration said. (Xinhua)

    HK retail sales fall 7 percent in March

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751663_1_L_20240503175013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales fell 7 percent in March from a year earlier, ending 15 months of growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to figures released by the Census And Statistics Department on Friday, sales totalled HK$31.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decline followed a 1.9 percent increase in February, and 0.9 percent growth in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, retail sales for the first quarter of 2024 fell by 1.3 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government blamed the drop on the high base of comparison for visitor spending and the timing of the Easter holidays last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It predicted that the retail sector will benefit from a continued tourism revival and rising household income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further revival of inbound tourism and rising household income should remain supportive to the retail sector. The government's efforts to promote a mega event economy and boost sentiment should also help. Yet, the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents may continue to pose challenges," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Annie Tse, said the sales drop was a result of more Hongkongers heading to the mainland in their free time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The northbound travel and consumption will continue since transportation is too convenient nowadays, and it is the trend. I would not say it's something that we want, but it's quite normal. We, as retailers, have to face the situation, and that will definitely be a continuing effect that will affect our industry," she said.

    Part of DSE Chinese history exam optional from 2026
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Friday said students taking Chinese History in the DSE exams will be allowed to skip part of the test from 2026.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the new arrangement, pupils can choose to take only a compulsory test that covers Chinese historical events ranging from the ancient Xia dynasty onwards, or they can also sit a paper that focuses on the political, religious, social and other aspects of different periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students only sitting the compulsory paper will be able to get a grade 5 at most, while those who sit the two papers can get up to 5**.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said students will not need to disclose to the exam authority if they are skipping a test, so they will not be labelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it has not consulted the sector extensively on the move because the syllabus and assessment method are not being changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they want to give students more choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to allow more students who are interested to take Chinese history, or let students study the subject according to their ability," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course teachers will need to think about how to allocate lesson time and take care of students of different ability levels. I believe this won't be difficult as we implement the change and teachers become experienced."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teachers will need to have a teaching plan ready when the new academic year starts in September for form five students who plan to only take the mandatory test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Hon-kuen who heads Education Convergence, a body consisting of teachers and principals, said it will not be hard to cater to two groups of students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the students can study in the library while others spend more time in the classroom. Or, if the teachers and principals are more dedicated, they can break the students into two groups and teach them separately," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Wai-hung, a senior Chinese history teacher at Fukien Secondary School (Siu Sai Wan), said it may be difficult to split students into two groups when there are not many taking the subject.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said Hong Kong has just experienced the warmest April on record, with the hottest day reaching almost 32 degrees Celsius.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The monthly mean temperature was 26.4 degrees – 3.4 degrees higher than usual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said the hot weather was down to a warmer than normal sea surface temperature and unusually strong southerly air flows over the northern part of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Affected by an anticyclone aloft and the subsequent southerly airstream, it was generally fine and hot during the day from April 11 to 17. With plenty of sunshine, the temperatures at the observatory rose to a maximum of 31.9 degrees on the afternoon of April 13, the highest of the month,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster added that the SAR was also a lot wetter than usual last month, with total rainfall of 257.1 millimetres – almost 70 percent more than usual.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said less than half of households participating in a trial run of a pay-as-you-throw scheme have been using the designated bags for rubbish disposal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said between 20 and 50 percent of households have been making use of the bags since they were given them last month, with the rate even lower in buildings that aren't run by management companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the department said most of the care homes, restaurants and government buildings taking part in the trial scheme have adopted the designated bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said they are aware that some businesses have seen their operational costs rise due to using the bags and officials will report these concerns to lawmakers on May 27.

    Orangutan seen apparently treating wound

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A male Sumatran orangutan named Rakus is seen two months after wound self-treatment using a medicinal plant. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751628_1_L_20240503133421.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists have observed an orangutan applying medicinal herbs to a face wound in an apparently successful attempt to heal an injury, the first time such behaviour has been recorded.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Primates have previously been seen eating plants or rubbing them on themselves in behaviour scientists theorised was intended to ward off disease or discomfort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the apparent treatment seen by researchers in Indonesia in 2022, and reported in the journal Nature Scientific Reports on Thursday, is the first time a wild animal has been seen applying medicinal plants to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists were tracking a male orangutan nicknamed Rakus at the Gunung Leuser National Park in Indonesia's Aceh province when they noticed an open wound on his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three days later, they spotted him chewing the leaves of a vine called Fibraurea tinctoria, which is known for its medicinal properties and has long been used in local traditional medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The orangutan "began chewing the leaves without swallowing them and using his fingers to apply the plant juice from his mouth directly onto his facial wound," said the study by Indonesian and German scientists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When flies began to land on the site, Rakus "smeared the entire wound with the plant pulp until the red flesh was fully covered with the green leaf material."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next day, Rakus was seen eating the vine's leaves again, and a week later his wound had closed up, subsequently healing without any sign of infection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study describes the behaviour as the "first systematically documented case of active wound treatment with a plant species known to contain biologically active substances by a wild animal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said it was impossible to be sure the behaviour was intentional, but the fact that the juice and leaves were applied repeatedly and only to the wound suggests Rakus was trying to treat his injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They speculate the orangutan could have stumbled across the treatment, perhaps by first chewing the plant and then finding the juice offered pain relief when accidently touching it to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orangutans are known to learn skills from each other through observation, but the scientists said they had no record of similar behaviour in 21 years and 28,000 observation hours in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rakus however had moved to the region from elsewhere, raising the possibility he learned the medical technique from a different community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observation adds to a growing body of evidence about the way primates use plants to keep healthy, including swallowing whole leaves that have anti-parasitic properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in Indonesia, orangutans have been seen rubbing the chewed leaves of a different plant into their skin, possibly to harness its anti-inflammatory properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in 2022, scientists reported on chimpanzees in Gabon that were seen apparently applying insects to wounds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The data of around 17,000 people who were required to undergo Covid tests at the peak of the pandemic has been exposed online, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has warned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the department said names, phone numbers, identity card numbers and addresses of residents were collected during lockdown operations between March and July in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The information was stored on an online server accessible to authorised staff using a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on April 30 this year, EMSD was told by the city's privacy watchdog that some information was accessible without the need for a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents of 14 public housing blocks are affected including those living in Yan Ching House of Kai Ching Estate in Kai Tak, Oi Ming House of Yau Oi Estate in Tuen Mun and Fu Leung House of Fu Cheong Estate in Sham Shui Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said it will launch an investigation but has not received any complaints so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think the situation is serious. We will initiate an investigation according to our normal procedures. We also suggest that the relevant department inform the affected individuals as soon as possible, given the relatively large number of people impacted," Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EMSD apologised for the incident, adding that it will notify the households affected by mail and "there is no evidence that relevant data has been published so far".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The matter has been reported to the police, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Security Bureau.

 The Chang'e-6 lunar probe is scheduled to be launched between 5pm and 6pm on Friday, with the preferred launch window targeted at 5.27pm, said the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's mysterious far side, the first endeavour of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Indiana Pacers powered into the second round of the NBA playoffs on Thursday, thrashing the depleted Milwaukee Bucks 120-98 to win their Eastern Conference series 4-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unable to close out the Bucks on Tuesday, the Pacers got their uptempo offence flowing again, relentlessly pulling away after trailing by seven points in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton delivered a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists, but it was reserve guard Obi Toppin leading the Pacers scoring with a career playoff high 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TJ McConnell added 20 points off the bench along with nine assists and four steals as the Pacers reserves contributed a whopping 50 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of the perseverance," Haliburton said of Toppin and McConnell. "Obviously neither of them had a really good game last game -- none of us did. We just responded the right way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana led by 12 at halftime, and after the Bucks cut the deficit to seven on a Brook Lopez layup with 1:05 left in the third the Pacers authored an 11-0 scoring run and romped away in the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight-time All-Star Damian Lillard returned from a two-game injury absence and led the Bucks with 28 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lopez and Bobby Portis scored 20 points apiece, but with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by the calf injury suffered late in the regular season the Bucks couldn't find an answer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks, who won the title in 2021, lost in the first round for the second straight season after falling to Miami last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers hadn't won a playoff series since 2014, when they reached the Eastern Conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Eastern Conference semi-finals Indiana will take on either the second-seeded New York Knicks or the Philadelphia 76ers, who clashed later Thursday in Philadelphia with the Sixers trying to stave off elimination. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pinpoint headed goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Nicolas Jackson earned Chelsea a 2-0 victory over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Thursday, dealing a blow to Spurs' hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former academy defender Chalobah diverted the ball expertly into the top corner from a Conor Gallagher free kick 35 metres out in the 24th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Chelsea a deserved lead after sustained pressure from the home side with chances for Mykhailo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke. Spurs defender Micky van de Ven kept his side in the match, with last-ditch tackles in the area and a clearance off the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham's Australian coach Ange Postecoglou looked furious in the dugout throughout the first 45 minutes and his side came out of the second half with greater verve and determination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But efforts by Son Heung-min and Pedro Porro were blocked and saved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senegal's Jackson calmed home nerves against the run of play in the 72nd minute when he was on hand to head home after a free kick from Chelsea top scorer Cole Palmer hit the bar and bounced down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three points, taking them to eighth, were vital for the push by Chelsea, under former Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino, towards a Europa League place after a disappointing season but left Tottenham seven points adrift of the top four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are in a good place," Pochettino said. "We have amazing professionals working on set-pieces. The team really showed in the way we wanted to build this way to play."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described the first half as fantastic. "Then you have to contain and suffer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou took responsibility for the defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like we've lost a bit of belief and conviction in our football and that is on me to change that," he said. "We were nowhere near good enough. That is on me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham have a poor record against their southwest London rivals. They lost the home fixture last November 4-1 and have won only one of their last 10 meetings. (Reuters)

    Sabalenka sets up Swiatek rematch in Madrid Open final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sabalenka had lost three of her last four clashes against Rybakina. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751599_1_L_20240503092119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Madrid Open champion Aryna Sabalenka produced a brilliant comeback from a set and a break down to beat Elena Rybakina and reach the final on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Belarusian second seed triumphed 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 [7/5] and will face world number one Iga Swiatek on Saturday in a rematch of last year's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinical Swiatek earlier eased past American Madison Keys with a comfortable 6-1, 6-3 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw third seed Daniil Medvedev retired injured from his quarter-final clash with Jiri Lehecka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka, 25, sealed her victory with a typically powerful serve that Rybakina could not control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitter had lost three of her last four clashes against the 24-year-old but emerged triumphant as they met on clay for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek has a 6-3 record against Sabalenka but in their only match in the Spanish capital, the latter triumphed in three sets a year ago to claim the title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominant on clay, Swiatek barely put a foot wrong against Keys, making just eight unforced errors in the match to leave the 29-year-old American with virtually no chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Medvedev struggled through to the end of the first set against Lehecka with an apparent upper thigh problem, losing it 6-4 before retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech progressed to his first Masters 1000 semi-final, where he will face Felix Auger Aliassime, who received a walkover after top seed Jannik Sinner withdrew Wednesday with a hip problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taylor Fritz will face Andrey Rublev in the other semi-final on Friday, after the Russian ousted home favourite Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Boris Johnson caught out by his own photo ID law

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751579_1_L_20240503051510.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British prime minister Boris Johnson, who introduced a contentious requirement for voters to show photo ID while voting, was turned away from a polling station on Thursday for forgetting to bring his.
 <br>
  <br/>
  British media reported that Johnson, who quit in 2022 following a scandal-ridden premiership, was initially turned away at a polling station in Oxfordshire, southern England, while trying to vote in local elections taking place across England on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said Johnson had voted Conservative but did not deny that the ex-PM had initially failed to produce photo ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As prime minister, Johnson's government introduced the ID requirement in 2022 to crack down on possible voter fraud but it was heavily criticised for the potential to disenfranchise parts of the electorate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously, voters only needed to give their name and address to be able to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it's unreasonable to ask first-time voters to produce some evidence of identity," Johnson had said of the new rules in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, in the first vote where the new rules were implemented, around 14,000 people in England were denied a vote in local elections after being unable to provide ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident is the latest in what has been a colourful political career for Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As London mayor he was once left dangling in the air when he got stranded on a zip wire, and as prime minister he was once pictured appearing to retreat into a large refrigerator while being pursued by a camera crew for an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poll by YouGov showed 14 percent of Britons were still unaware, in the days prior to Thursday's elections, of the voter ID requirement. (Reuters)

    Apple beats Q1 expectations, announces share buyback

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Apple has announced its biggest ever share buyback. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751578_1_L_20240503051021.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday reported a smaller than expected decline in quarterly revenue, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company expects a return to sales growth in the current quarter as it invests in AI features to be unveiled in the coming months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apple increased its cash dividend by 4 percent and authorised an additional programme to buy back US$110 billion of its stock. The buyback is the largest in the company's history, according to Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Apple surged roughly 7 percent in extended trade after the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple said fiscal second-quarter revenue fell 4 percent to US$90.8 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of US$90.01 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Apple's current quarter, which ends in June, Cook said the iPhone maker expects "to grow low-single digits" in overall revenue. Wall Street expects 1.33 percent revenue growth to US$82.89 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple faces a raft of challenges across its business. Smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics have introduced competing devices aimed at hosting artificial-intelligence chatbots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the regulatory front, Apple's services business, which contains its lucrative App Store and was one of the few areas of growth in the fiscal second quarter, is under pressure from a new law in Europe. In the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market and driving up prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the fiscal second quarter, IPhone sales fell 10.5 percent to US$45.96 billion, compared with analyst expectations of US$46 billion. Apple executives said in February that the year-ago fiscal second quarter had benefited from a US$5 billion surge in iPhone sales as the company caught up from supply-chain snarls during pandemic lockdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling 10 percent this year. (Reuters)

 US stocks rallied on Thursday as investors weighed the Federal Reserve's more dovish-than-expected interest rate guidance on Wednesday against a plethora of mixed earnings and economic data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three indexes ended in positive territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way, advancing 1.5 percent with a healthy boost from chip stocks after Qualcomm reported quarterly sales and profit above analysts' expectations.

  Markets continued to parse Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assurances on Wednesday that the central bank's next policy move will be to lower its key policy rate, after it left rates unchanged at the end of its monthly meeting. However, he noted that recent strong inflation readings have suggested that first of these rate cuts could be a long time in coming.

  "They're not willing to raise rates from here. They'll keep rates steady, and any sign of economic weakness or lower inflation, they are going to be ready to jump on it and cut."

  Data released on Thursday included muted jobless claims, a drop in planned layoffs, a surge in quarterly labour costs and a sharp deceleration in productivity, all of which throws focus on Friday's closely watched April employment report.

  "The Fed has been consistent in saying they're going to be data dependent," said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. "We went into this year thinking there could be more cuts, earlier. "The data hasn't supported that."
