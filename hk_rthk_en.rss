<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government will look into ways to revise a pilot scheme that lets developers take on the role of building subsidised housing flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the administration had rejected a tender for a residential site in Chai Wan earlier this week, after only one bid was received and it failed to meet the reserve price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cheung Man Road site is earmarked for at least 700 units with the government setting the price at 65 percent of the market value - with any unsold units to be kept by the developer to sell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, the housing minister said the administration is open to suggestions from the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest rate wasn't lowered as expected so developers feel it's very difficult after doing their calculations. For other terms and conditions our industry friends and professional associations can give us some advice. We will take them as a reference. We have other land to choose from, such as different locations, ground area, or unit numbers. That might make a difference. Give us some time to study this," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government is tendering three sites for development under its Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme, which was announced last year to boost supply of subsidised homes by working with private developers.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="High-speed trains across France suffered heavy traffic disruption following a 'coordinated sabotage' on Friday, ahead of the Olympics Opening Ceremony. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763379_1_20240727090641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French rail officials warned of travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of people throughout the weekend after saboteurs following a meticulous plan paralysed much of the train network on Friday as the Olympic Games started.
 <br>
  <br/>
  No immediate claim of responsibility was made for the arson attacks on cabling boxes at junctions strategically picked out north, southwest and east of the capital where the Olympics opening ceremony was staged on Friday night. Rail workers thwarted a fourth attempt to destroy safety equipment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNCF rail company called it a "massive attack".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts," Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services from Paris to much of France saw mass cancellations and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Eurostar company said it scrapped about a quarter of its trains between London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. It predicted cancelling about a fifth of trains over the weekend and all services will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to take a plane instead of a high speed train to the Olympics ceremony. Four special trains bringing Olympic athletes to Paris, including some US team members, went ahead, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With one of France's busiest holiday travel weekends clashing with the start of the Olympics, SNCF said about a quarter of trains will be cancelled on Saturday and Sunday on the lines attacked. Trains that run will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said thousands of staff worked to repair the damage and try to get services running again. It estimated that about 250,000 passengers were affected on Friday. Junior transport minister Patrice Vergriete said 800,000 could face the fallout over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At each site, the perpetrators targeted fibre optic cables that carry safety information for drivers and control rail changes, SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gerard Due, mayor of Croisilles in northern France, one of the sites hit, said the attackers had specialised equipment to access the cables and then "threw a flammable liquid" on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vergriete said that the saboteurs had been spotted with "vans", while "incendiary devices were found at the scene".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French security forces are on their highest alert to prevent attacks during the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Olympic Games open on Friday after a soaking wet ceremony in which athletes were cheered by the crowd along the Seine as dancers took to the roofs of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France's three-time Olympic gold medallists Marie-Jose Perec and Teddy Riner then lit the Olympic cauldron, suspended on a hot-air balloon, before Canada's Celine Dion sang Edith Piaf's "Hymn to Love", in her first public performance in years, drawing huge cheers from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fleet of barges took the competitors on a 6 km-stretch of the river alongside some of the French capital's most famous landmarks, as performers recreated some of the sports to be showcased in the Games on floating platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time that an opening ceremony has taken place outside a stadium, adding to the headaches for a vast security operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I invite everybody: dream with us. Like the Olympic athletes, be inspired with the joy that only sport can give us. Let us celebrate this Olympic spirit of living in peace," International Olympics Committee President Thomas Bach said as the ceremony came to an end at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mix of French and international stars, including soccer great Zinedine Zidane, 14-times French Open champion Rafa Nadal, 23-times Grand Slam champion Serena Williams and three paralympic athletes were among the last torchbearers before the cauldron was lit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will blaze until the closing ceremony on August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rain forced some fans to leave early, those who spoke to RTHK's Hailey Yip and Kelly Yu were impressed by what they saw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought it was very beautiful," one French spectator said. "Very artistic, very creative, very French, lots of contrast, lots of great pictures, so I think it was fabulous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, crowds cheered as the teams headed down the Seine on a series of barges. The Hong Kong, China team deployed umbrellas as heavy rain struck, with athletes including flag-bearers Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung snapping selfies along the way.

    US stocks rally after better inflation data

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The three major indices on Wall Street all powered higher on Friday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763363_1_20240727051438.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks cheered a benign US inflation report on Friday, powering the market to a positive conclusion to the week despite weakness in tech shares in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in June, from 2.6 percent, amounting to progress in a key US Federal Reserve indicator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped 1.6 percent to 40,589.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 percent to 5,459, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.0 percent to 17,357.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Wednesday, led by a rout in tech shares, which have been seen as overvalued after strong gains in the first half of 2024. Despite the Nasdaq's bounce on Friday, the index finished the week down more than two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to have slowing inflation and solid growth," conditions "consistent with a soft landing thesis," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kourkafas expects more of a "rotation" away from technology to other sectors in the upcoming period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, 3M shot up around 23 percent after reporting better-than-expected earnings and lifting its full-year profit forecast. Analysts see the industrial heavyweight as well positioned following progress on major litigation issues that have dogged the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biogen dove 7.2 percent after announcing European officials gave a negative reading on a new Alzheimer's disease treatment. Biogen and partner Eisai said they would seek a reexamination of the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DexCom, which supplies glucose monitoring systems for diabetes, plunged more than 40 percent after lowering its sales forecast. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes from the SAR and the national team got a warm welcome on the River Seine on Friday evening as the Olympic Games opening ceremony got under way in spectacular fashion in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China team, led by table tennis star Ma Long and synchronised swimmer Feng Yu, represented one of the biggest national delegations in the barge parade winding through the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rain had started to fall when Team Hong Kong, China, entered the ceremony a short time later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung carried the flag at the head of a 35-strong team. Most of the athletes carried umbrellas and many were snapping pictures as they passed the famous landmarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In accordance with tradition, Greece led the procession before the other teams came out in alphabetical order. Hosts France will enter last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other early highlights of the ceremony saw Lady Gaga sing a French cabaret song near Notre-Dame cathedral, a giant plume of blue, white and red smoke sent high above a bridge over the Seine and a winged man played accordion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lady Gaga, surrounded by dancers, sang "Mon truc en plumes" (My thing made of feathers).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water fountains threw up jets of water in the middle of the Seine as the boats went by, with athletes waving at the crowds, amid a huge visible police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony comes just hours after a sabotage attack on the high-speed TGV rail network caused travel chaos across France and put the spotlight on the security risks at a time when all eyes are on the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show started by depicting a fictional scenario in which the arrival of the Olympic flame goes awry, ahead of the extravagant show on the river that will kick off the summer Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French soccer superstar Zinedine Zidane was shown running across Paris to bring the flame, in a pre-recorded video that included him taking it onto the metro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spectators were treated to postcard-like depictions of France and a huge cancan line performed by Moulin Rouge cabaret dancers on the banks. (RTHK/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's police watchdog on Friday said it had launched a criminal probe into an incident caught on video in which an officer appeared to kick and stamp on a man's head while making an arrest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police in northwest England has suspended an officer from all duties following the incident at Manchester Airport on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can confirm we are conducting a criminal investigation into the use of force during events which took place on 23 July at Manchester Airport," said Catherine Bates, regional director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer involved would be formally interviewed "as soon as possible," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video, which has circulated online, caused public outrage and two nights of protests in Manchester and nearby Rochdale. The IOPC said it was looking at the "level of force" used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police has said that three officers were assaulted, with one female officer "suffering a broken nose" and requiring hospital treatment, while apprehending a suspect at the airport following reports of an assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Details of what happened immediately before and after the video remain unclear. Police said the "use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said after seeing the full footage leading up to the circulated clip that it was "not a clearcut situation" and that while the clip was "disturbing," there were issues "on both sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two men were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of assault and assault of an emergency worker among other counts.

    Olympic Games a chance to 'silence the guns': Guterres

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763351_1_20240727012647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged countries around the world to stop armed conflict as part of the Olympic truce, with the Paris 2024 Olympics set to open later on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guterres met International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and said the Games were a chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to express the total support of the United Nations to the IOC," Guterres said. "We live in a divided world where conflicts are proliferating in a dramatic way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The horrendous suffering in Gaza, the seemingly endless war in Ukraine, terrible suffering from Sudan to the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo), from the Sahel to Myanmar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment like this it is important to say that the first recorded, in history, real peace initiative was the Olympic truce."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Olympics in ancient Greece all conflicts ceased for the duration of the Games to allow for the competitions to go ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment in which the Olympic Games will start it is time to remind the world of the importance of the Olympic truce and to make the world understand that we must silence the guns," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Games kick off later on Friday and end on August 11 with the participation of more than 10,500 athletes representing 206 nations and territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include a Palestinian team, which while not a full member of the United Nations, has an official national Olympic Committee, as well as athletes from Russia and Belarus, who will compete as neutrals without a flag or emblem following the assault on Ukraine in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this is the moment in which my strong appeal is for countries to come together with the same spirit as athletes will be coming together during the Olympic Games in Paris," Guterres said. (Reuters)

 Bangladeshi police detectives on Friday forced the discharge from hospital of three student protest leaders blamed for deadly unrest, taking them to an unknown location.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Asif Mahmud, Nahid Islam and Abu Baker Majumder are all members of Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising recent street rallies against civil service hiring rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 193 people were killed in the ensuing police crackdown and clashes, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, in some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio were being treated for injuries that they said were caused by torture in earlier police custody at a hospital in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They took them from us," Gonoshasthaya hospital supervisor Anwara Begum Lucky said. "The men were from the Detective Branch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that she had not wanted to discharge the student leaders but police had pressured the hospital chief to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islam's elder sister Fatema Tasnim said from the hospital that six plainclothes detectives had taken all three men. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former US president Barack Obama endorsed his fellow Democrat Kamala Harris' bid for the White House on Friday, delivering a major boost to her campaign to defeat Donald Trump in November's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's first woman vice president is seeking to make history again in November after President Joe Biden abruptly announced he would not seek re-election after weeks of mounting pressure on him to quit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barack and Michelle Obama's backing will add to the growing momentum behind Harris' campaign, with polls showing she has already narrowed the gap that existed between Trump and Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend Kamala Harris. We told her we think she'll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support," Obama said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this critical moment for our country, we're going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you'll join us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The influential former leader and first black US president was one of the last Democratic heavy hitters to offer his endorsement, with Harris having already received the backing of Biden on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, jumped into the election after weeks of turmoil over 81-year-old Biden, who bowed out after a dismal debate performance against Trump accelerated concerns over his mental capacity and persistently low polling numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since launched a blistering attack on Trump and his "extremist" Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Harris addressed the American Federation of Teachers – the first union to endorse her bid – warning the country was witnessing a "full-on attack" by Trump's Republicans on "hard-won, hard-fought freedoms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic Party delegates have rapidly rallied en masse behind Harris, and the momentum behind her campaign has appeared to catch Trump off guard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bombastic Republican has refused to schedule a debate with Harris, saying Thursday night it would be "inappropriate" until she was officially named the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, a former top prosecutor for California, chided her opponent on X, saying: "What happened to 'any time, any place?'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had previously said of a potential September 10 face-off: "I'm ready. So let's go." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French rail operator SNCF says three night-time arson attacks had destroyed cabling boxes at strategic junctions around its network. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763323_2_20240726221054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's rail network was paralysed on Friday by what authorities called coordinated acts of sabotage, which knocked out most of its high-speed train services hours before the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At Paris' Gare du Nord station, a Hongkonger living in the UK said he may have to call off his trip to Brussels because his train had been delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at the station half an hour early and saw my train was delayed for half an hour. And the train is getting delayed further. I’m afraid that it may be cancelled and my schedule will be a mess."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rail operator SNCF said three night-time arson attacks had destroyed cabling boxes at strategic junctions around its network at locations north, south-west and east of Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth attempted act of vandalism south-east of the capital was thwarted by rail workers who spotted intruders in the early hours of Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts", Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics are set to open in a spectacular and unprecedented ceremony on the river Seine on Friday evening, with many ticket holders set to travel to the City of Light by train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With some trains on the Eurostar network – whose routes include Paris to London – cancelled, a traveller in the UK, Saloni Modi, said she was worried she could not make the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nervous about missing it, yes. Because it's something that we've planned and we're looking forward to, and it's almost like a once in a lifetime because you don't get to go to that all the time. So we're hoping we make it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French officials refused to comment on the identity of the culprits of the rail sabotage who appear to have had a sophisticated understanding of the network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the rail disruption, which will affect 800,000 people over the weekend, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach told the media that he had no concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have full confidence in the French authorities," he said at the Athletes' Village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The USA basketball team was also set to take a high-speed train to play their opening game on Sunday against Serbia in Lille, northern France. (Additional reporting by AFP and Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans from around the world gathered by the River Seine in Paris on Friday for the first-ever Olympics opening ceremony outside a stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of boats were to take athletes on a 6-kilometre journey along the river, past major landmarks including the Notre Dame and the Louvre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 300,000 spectators, including VIPs and celebrities from around the world, were expected to enjoy the show from the river banks – a big difference compared to the last Olympics in Tokyo, when the Covid pandemic meant the Games opened in an empty stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A little rain in Paris didn't stop spectators from waiting along the river banks hours before the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca, a tourist from the United States, said going to the Games was on her bucket list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That's why we came, when we found out that four years ago… they were going to have their opening ceremony going down the Seine, we decided that we have to be here,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s amazing, just because you have such a beautiful city and then the Olympics, which is number one on my bucket list to go to an Olympics in what other place to be than Paris.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tight security measures were put in place to ensure safety, including restricting most of the River Seine, and requiring visitors to present a QR code.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours before the ceremony,  France’s high-speed network was hit by arson attacks, forcing many services to be cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ed Settle from North Carolina said he was looking forward to the ceremony in spite of the trouble getting to the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will be interesting to see because it’s the first [ceremony] without the stadium, so I guess how the city can handle it but also how spectators will also be able handle it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We just were able to find this opening here. We've been walking a little bit. Definitely can make it a little bit easier to navigate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening ceremony, from 1.30am Hong Kong time, is expected to last around four hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing champion Edgar Cheung and swimming star Siobhan Haughey are the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China delegation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its unique advantages to promote new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a seminar on new quality productive forces, Chan said Hong Kong needs to work with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly, we should actively make good use of Hong Kong's advantages as an international financial hub to strengthen all-round capital support for new quality productive forces. Secondly, it's to attract professionals and firms to here," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thirdly, we need to enhance our cooperation with the brother cities in the Greater Bay Area. That will definitely inject momentum into new quality productive forces and high quality development in the area."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Dean of the Institute of Contemporary China Studies of Tsinghua University, Hu Angang, said Hong Kong has an increasingly important role to play in the nation's economic modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to transfer the manufacturing sector from the developed areas near the coast towards the mid-west part area, forming a big domestic cycle. But most importantly, we need to encourage local firms, especially manufacturers, to invest and move overseas, forming a so-called international big cycle," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the main strategy of China's economic modernisation. It is not a single cycle, but two inter-related cycles. The role and status of Hong Kong will not be lowered, but will continue to grow. "
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hu added that the Chinese economy has been growing rapidly and predicted gross domestic product per capita to exceed US$30,000 by 2035.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday appealed to the entire city to rally behind Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the CE highlighted the continued emergence of new talent, adding that he believed all athletes would give their best on the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 35 athletes from Hong Kong, China, will be competing in 13 sports at the upcoming Olympic Games, with more than half of them making their Olympic debut. This not only marks the passing of the torch of Hong Kong sports to the new generation, but also highlights the emergence of new talent in the field," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government has secured the television rights for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These events will be broadcast live on four free-to-air television channels and screened at designated sports centres in all 18 districts, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling for a citywide celebration, Lee urged everyone to unite in cheering on Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.

 The annual Animation-Comic-Game fair began on Friday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, with hundreds queuing before the doors opened.

  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event, with more than 140 exhibitors taking part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ho, who was at the front of the queue, said he hoped to buy his favourite toys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I started queuing at around 7, as first place tickets require us to be here from 7 to 7.50, so I don’t want to be late. I’m here to buy deadpool toys for my friend, and I’ll take a look at figures and toys. I am expecting to spend around HK$7,000 to HK$8,000,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Lam, whose stall features Inside Out 2 merchandise, said the expectation was that 80 percent of goods would be sold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Cheng was also optimistic about sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The highlight product will be the plushie from Chikawa, they all are from Japan, they are all very famous in Hong Kong, China and Japan. We also have Mofusand, a very famous IP character in Hong Kong. We hope we can have around HK$1 million in sales,” Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Chung was in the exhibition area, dressed as Kaedehara Kazuha from Genshin Impact. He said he had seen more cosplayers this year, but he had a complaint about the ticket arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The arrangement this year is more complicated. I’m a cosplayer and I have to buy another ticket to get into the cosplayer zone. [It is] somehow too much, but at the same time, it provides a more quiet space for cosplayers and photographers to take pictures, which is a more professional approach,” Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson Woo, who was dressed as Monster 8 from Kaiju No. 8, was also unhappy with the two separate areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[This year] is the worst. Hall 3 needs to pay [to enter], but [tickets are] only for 2,500 cosplayers. It is too low, [and the organiser] doesn't have any more tickets [for cosplayers]. Last year Hall 3 was free and it was very nice,” Woo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the venue, Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong chief executive officer Leung Chung-pun said the visitor flow was similar to that of previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that organisers aim to provide a pleasant venue for cosplayers to participate in the yearly event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My major concern is the welfare of the cosplayers. The atmosphere is not my major concern, as long as cosplayers have a good environment to enjoy their time here, I am happy,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will run until July 30.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB says it will organise a series of events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, including screening patriotic movies and offering free Chinese medicine services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photography competition will enable participants to express how they “love and treasure our home and country” through their work. The winning entries will be showcased in an exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party will also host various technology-related exhibitions in shopping malls across Hong Kong, including one showcasing China-produced electric cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be a poster design competition for secondary students with the theme of “showcasing China's achievements.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will utilise our district network advantage to organise the events,” the party’s chairman Gary Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope every district in Hong Kong can feel the celebratory atmosphere of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB said it will also hold a short video contest to gather tourism ideas that show "the other side of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the contest is not just a celebratory event, but also a response to the concept of “tourism is everywhere in Hong Kong" as expressed by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawmaker said he believes Hong Kong locals are best positioned to identify unique tourism spots within the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs on Friday said they arrested 18 people this month on suspicion of allowing party room and restaurant customers to stream karaoke songs in breach of copyright laws.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they raided 31 party rooms and one restaurant between July 2 and 25, seizing karaoke song players and four gaming devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisional commander for intellectual property technology crime investigation, Shek Ka-yin, said it is the first time customs has cracked down on people allegedly offering karaoke songs via online streaming platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional cases, party rooms or restaurants are installed with karaoke players preloaded with infringing karaoke songs," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this case, instead, infringing karaoke songs which were preloaded in the karaoke devices were put in a data centre, which used the streaming technology to transfer the infringing karaoke songs to the subject party rooms for use by the customers," Shek alleged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs said two people were charged with infringing copyright and violation of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, while the remaining 16 were released on bail.

    Business leaders have high hopes for Asean trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Business leaders who will be part of an SAR delegation travelling with Chief Executive John Lee to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam this month say they hope Hong Kong can strengthen ties with the Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said professional services the SAR offers are in demand in many Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Vietnam lacks skilled labour and Hong Kong companies can help them with skill training. As for Laos, I think its infrastructure is lagging behind and needs Hong Kong's expertise in infrastructure development,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that she hopes to secure tax incentives for Hong Kong businesses in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have already established a bilateral tax agreement with Vietnam and Cambodia, but we haven’t secured that with Laos. I am eager to see if there will be further progress,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Chuang, the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, said a survey found that 45 percent of its 120 members operate in Asean countries, with the majority in Vietnam, a small number in Cambodia and just one in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is a good time to visit Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, given the many business opportunities offered in these countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There have been more factories setting up in Cambodia in recent years. The country also has a young population with strong purchasing power,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I also hope to take this opportunity to understand more about Laos. It is a relatively new market and there’s a new railway connecting its capital Vientiane and Kunming. This is the first major cross-border railway connecting China and an Asean country, which has brought Laos loads of people, logistics and capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chuang added that large companies in Vietnam can make use of Hong Kong’s role as an international finance centre to raise money.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced on Friday that he has reappointed Eddie Yue as chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chan praised Yue's leadership, highlighting the authority's success in maintaining local monetary and banking stability amid challenges in recent years including black-clad violence and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that Eddie will continue to lead the HKMA effectively in the coming five years and make further contributions to Hong Kong's financial, economic and social progress," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Yue expressed gratitude for the finance minister's trust, adding that he will strive to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment, the international financial landscape, and geopolitics are likely to remain complex and uncertain for some time," Yue said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that consolidating and expanding Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is the best way for us to contribute to the prosperity of our country and Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's new five-year term is set to commence on October 1.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told the visiting Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the spirit of the rule of law is highly respected in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive's Office said during a meeting on Wednesday, the SAR leader spoke about the territory's current economic situation, business opportunities and market potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that the SAR government would adopt necessary measures to ensure the safety of people in Hong Kong, adding that all its actions abide strictly with local laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Kuleba had called on Lee to prevent Russia from using Hong Kong as a way to circumvent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kuleba travelled to Hong Kong following more than three hours of talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Guangzhou on Wednesday, which focused on ways to put an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine. (Additional reporting by agencies)

 South Africa shocked New Zealand 14-7 on Thursday to earn an Olympic rugby sevens semi-final against France, while double-defending champions Fiji edged Ireland and will meet Australia in Saturday's medal matches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  South Africa, who qualified for the Games by winning the final repechage slot last month, went ahead with a try by Selwyn Davies, who then delivered a great kick and chase which he scooped up to gift Tristan Leyds a second try, both converted by Leyds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo silver medallists New Zealand closed the gap to 14-7 at halftime through Moses Leo and then hammered at the door throughout the second half but were kept at bay by some incredible South African defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Fiji extended their proud record of winning every match they have played at the Olympics since sevens was introduced in 2016 but they were pushed all the way by a remarkable Irish side who are relative newcomers to the format.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iosefo Baleiwairiki claimed the first Fiji try after 30 seconds but Ireland led 10-7 at halftime after two well-finished tries by Chay Mullins. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray withdrew from the tennis singles at the Paris Olympics on Thursday but the two-time gold medallist will play doubles in what will be the final event of his glittering career.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British former world number one, who will retire at the end of his fifth Games, has still not fully recovered from back surgery last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He believes the men's doubles, where he is playing with Dan Evans, offers his best chance of another medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've taken the decision to withdraw from the singles to concentrate on the doubles with Dan," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our practice has been great and we're playing well together. Really looking forward to getting started and representing GB one more time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray won gold in singles at London 2012 and in Rio four years later, as well as silver in mixed doubles with Laura Robson in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His withdrawal means his final singles match was his brief second-round appearance at Queen's Club against Jordan Thompson last month before he was forced to pull out because of a spinal cyst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scot confirmed earlier this week that he would retire after the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Thursday as traders contended with corporate earnings and economic data that came in far stronger than expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy surprised analysts by growing at an annualised rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter of the year – double the level seen between January and March, and well above economists' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 39,935, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to close at 5,399.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also finished the day in the red, declining by 0.9 percent to 17,181.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a strong economic report, so that helped boost investors' enthusiasm," Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin said. "But we also had some a mixed picture on the micro front."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had some disappointments out of Ford, American Airlines, so I think that it's creating perhaps a little tension in the market today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, US auto giant Ford fell by 18.4 percent after missing earnings expectations, leading a sell-off in the sector that left General Motors and Stellantis down 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some cause for optimism as well on Thursday, with health care services provider Molina and digital workflow firm ServiceNow both finishing the day up, by 12.3 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors' attention is also firmly fixed on Friday's inflation data, which is sure to be closely scrutinised ahead of next week's Federal Reserve interest rate decision. (AFP)

    US rejects plan for G20 deal to tax super-rich

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Janet Yellen says all countries should make sure their taxation systems are fair and progressive. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763185_1_20240726021119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States sees no need to negotiate an international agreement on taxing the super-wealthy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, highlighting divisions on a plan that is top of the agenda at a G20 finance ministers' meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taxing the ultra-rich is a key priority of Brazil's leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who this year heads the G20 grouping of the world's major economies, the European Union and African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally," Yellen told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro, ahead of an evening meeting between finance ministers to discuss the topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see a need or really think it's desirable to try to negotiate a global agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that their taxation systems are fair and progressive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen said Washington was "strongly supportive of progressive taxation, and making sure that very wealthy, high-income individuals pay their fair share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She highlighted policies proposed by US President Joe Biden, such as a billionaires' tax, which she described as "a very worthwhile initiative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It makes sense for most countries to take this approach of progressive taxation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's search for a global agreement on taxing the richest of the rich is backed by France, Spain, South Africa, Colombia and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some individuals control more resources than entire countries," Lula said on Wednesday at the launch of an initiative to fight world hunger, another project topping his G20 agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His finance minister, Fernando Haddad, told local media on Wednesday that taxing billionaires would help finance the fight against hunger but "it will not be established overnight, because it is a very delicate mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global inequality has continued to widen in recent years, according to a study by the NGO Oxfam published on Thursday. The richest one percent of the world have earned more than US$40 trillion in a decade, but their taxation is at "historically" low rates, the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French economist Gabriel Zucman, a consultant with the G20 on taxation issues, estimates that the tax rate for billionaires represents 0.3 percent of their wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent report commissioned by the G20, he called for super-wealthy individuals to be taxed the equivalent of two percent of their fortune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington is not the only sceptic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the eve of the G20 meeting, Germany's finance ministry said it considers the idea of a minimum wealth tax to be "irrelevant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting of finance ministers in Rio opened with a session on the global economy, as inflation slows in many parts of the world after a surge fuelled by the war in Ukraine and other factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the ministers will tackle the financing of the climate transition and debt in their last meeting before a G20 summit on November 18 and 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Founded in 1999, the Group of 20 assembles 19 of the world's largest economic powers, as well as the European Union and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation was originally focused on global economic issues but has increasingly taken on other pressing challenges – even though member states do not always agree on what should be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's presidency said in a statement that some members of the G20 considered that crises such as the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza "have an impact on the global economy and should be addressed at the G20, while others believe that the G20 is not the place to discuss these issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisions within the G20, of which Russia is also a member, have made drafting a joint communique at the outcome of meetings a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last meeting of finance ministers in Sao Paulo failed to issue such a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil hopes to publish three texts after the meeting, said Tatiana Rosito, a senior official at the country's economy ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from a joint final communique, this would include a document on "international cooperation in tax matters" and a separate communique from Brazil on geopolitical crises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is likely, based on my experience of previous G20s," that future ministerial-level meetings will publish separate statements in this manner, European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming for a single text "would not allow us to adopt anything," she said. (AFP)

    Netanyahu, Biden meet for tense ceasefire talks

Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763184_1_20240726015819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday he was ready to work with Joe Biden for the rest of his presidency, as the two leaders met for the first time at the White House for talks on a Gaza ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to thank you for the 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel," Netanyahu said after they shook hands in the historic setting of the Oval Office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden stunned the world on Sunday when he announced that he was bowing out of the US presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris now set to be the Democratic Party's candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu will also meet Harris separately at the White House, in a reflection of the new political reality that will see Biden as a lame duck president for his remaining six months in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris meeting comes amid speculation that if she wins in November it could herald a tougher approach on Israel's war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between Biden and Netanyahu are tense over Israel's conduct in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attacks, but the US president has continued strong military and political support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have met just three times during his presidency, once in September last year in New York, and then when Biden travelled to Israel after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu on the airport tarmac at Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meetings come after Netanyahu vowed "total victory" against Hamas in a fiery speech Wednesday to the US Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Netanyahu will later meet the families of US hostages held in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House was surrounded by metal barriers and a heavy police presence, after rowdy protests broke out near the Capitol following Netanyahu's speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris on Thursday condemned the "despicable" and "unpatriotic" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a primetime speech explaining his decision on Sunday to bow out of the US presidential election, Biden made clear that resolving the conflict would remain a top priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to keep working to end the war on Gaza, bring home all the hostages to bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war," the US president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said on Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the "closing stages" and that Biden would try to close some "final gaps" with Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris has previously been more outspoken about Israel's conduct of the war, prompting speculation she will shift her policy as presidential nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US official said there was "no daylight between the president and vice president," who will meet Netanyahu at 4:30 pm (2030 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu will meet Republican contender Donald Trump on Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ex-president on Thursday morning urged Israel to quickly "finish up" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has offered Israel steadfast support since October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the US president has been increasingly critical of Israel over the Palestinian death toll in its offensive in Gaza, and criticised restrictions on the amount of aid getting through to the territory, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures. Out of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Israeli military 327 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza military campaign since the start of the ground offensive on October 27. (AFP)

    US economy beats growth expectations in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Commerce Department says the acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending." Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763181_1_20240726012528.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US economic growth blew past expectations in the second quarter, boosted by consumer spending and inventory building despite high interest rates, US government data showed on Thursday, after a slow start to the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy grew 2.8 percent in the April to June period, up from 1.4 percent in the first three months this year, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial estimate was markedly above the 1.9 percent growth rate economists anticipated – a reassuring sign that consumption remains resilient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending," said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "partly offset by a downturn in residential fixed investment," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While sectors like manufacturing and housing have been struggling after the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked interest rates in 2022 to combat surging inflation, consumption has been stronger than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This gave the economy a boost despite rates hovering at their highest levels in more than two decades – making borrowing more expensive for individuals and companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key factor underpinning consumption has been the robust labour market, which saw continued wage growth and businesses reluctant to let go of workers after difficulties in hiring during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With inflation slowing and salaries still growing, economists said consumers' real disposable income gains became bigger, allowing them to keep dipping into their wallets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the economy outperforming predictions of possible recession, President Joe Biden has struggled to assuage concerns of many Americans feeling the pinch from higher costs of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his shock exit from the 2024 election, it remains to be seen if that negative sentiment will transfer to his likely Democratic replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see consumption continuing to be the engine of the economy, continuing to keep economic growth on a relatively strong growth path of around two percent," said economist Matthew Martin of Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that although unemployment has been edging up, the trend has more to do with entrances into the market rather than layoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means it is not the start of a cycle where unemployment leads to income loss, in turn reducing spending and triggering more job losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there remain risks to the economy as unemployment tends to "shoot up" quickly, he said, noting that is not currently an expected outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's a big case to begin cutting rates in September and follow up with one every other meeting from there," he said of the US Federal Reserve's policymaking committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maintaining excessively restrictive monetary policy when the labour market appears to be fully back in balance could lead to an undesired weakening of employment growth and the economy," said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a recent note. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kevin Yeung visits the Hong Kong, China delegation at the Olympic Village in Paris. Photo courtesy of Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763178_1_20240726003721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said on Thursday that Hong Kong has a good training system in place to produce new top athletes, noting that most of those representing the SAR at the Olympics this year are competing in the Games for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister made the comments after arriving at the Olympic Village to meet the Hong Kong, China delegation, adding that the athletes are quite pleased with the facilities in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said he is looking forward to cheering on the SAR squad during his time in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Having very high-standard athletes starting to emerge in our system, which I think is very important for a region like Hong Kong because we are not just looking at one or two excellent athletes,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would like to have a system that could continuously produce athletes up to the world standards. That is very encouraging to us and to everyone in Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Chef de Mission for the Hong Kong, China delegation Brian Stevenson said that the SAR team is coming in strong with many Olympic medal winners and world champions, adding that the team had no issues adjusting to the new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we're very well prepared. We had a challenge initially, of course, which was to do with the air conditioning, which everybody had. And we resolved that by bringing in our own air conditioning units. And they got in. That was resolved. So all are getting absolutely no complaints. I'm getting no complaints,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of the delegations are a bit concerned about their athletes and the food. Not from the Hong Kong delegation. And we're always checking with them as regards to the food, the environment. Everything's good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stevenson also confirmed that the parade of athletes will take place on the River Seine by boat on July 26.

    Parisians look forward to dipping into the Seine again

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Paris Olympics just around the corner, the French capital is a step closer to the dream of swimming in the River Seine again, as bacteria levels go down to an acceptable level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swimming in the iconic river has been banned since 1923, but athletes and Parisians may soon be able to take a dip thanks to cleanup efforts for the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Historically there's been pollution from industry, from farms upstream of Paris, and then from the city itself, from frankly raw sewage that goes into the river,” said Matthew Heberger, a Paris-based hydrologist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest water quality tests show that the river is mostly safe for swimming under standards set by international swimming and triathlon federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the biggest risk, as Heberger explained, is "that if there's a large rainstorm in the 24 hours before one of the swimming events that could wash a lot of storm water off of the land surfaces around the city which brings with it pollution".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 30, the Seine is set to host outdoor swimming events during the Games. But the triathlon could be postponed or changed to a duathlon without swimming if the river water is unsafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR triathlete Jason Ng is expecting to race in the river that day. But while he cannot guarantee that his event will go ahead, Ng said he will just focus on what he can control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would prefer the swim not to be cancelled as I've qualified for triathlon, and I would prefer to actually race the event that I've qualified for in the Olympics,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course having the swim cancelled will favour some athletes who are not as strong swimmers, but again I think you just have to deal with what comes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the Seine in mid-July to convince doubters that the water is safe enough for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local surnamed Boutin told RTHK that he too wants to take a dip if all goes well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be a new future for Paris and I think it’s going to be a good thing. It was a little browner, now it’s greenish. There’s a colour change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And another Parisian, Kelfa, said he hopes the river will stay clean so people can swim even after the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I do believe the numbers of the studies, like they’ve been saying recently it was too high of bacteria for us to swim in it, which I do believe,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And now apparently they’ve invested a lot to clean it and the numbers are better. I guess we should trust them.”

 Typhoon Gaemi made landfall in Fujian province on Thursday night after it swept through Taiwan where it killed three people, triggered floods and sank a freighter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gaemi is the biggest typhoon to hit China's eastern seaboard this year, with its spiralling cloud-bands spanning most of the Western Pacific Ocean and fuelling severe weather from the Philippines to Japan's Okinawa islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation's Transport Ministry had earlier upgraded the typhoon prevention response to level two, the second highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media said some rail services in Guangzhou were suspended, while Wenzhou in Zhejiang province stopped multiple passenger sailings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said it will closely monitor the typhoon, strengthen warning and coordination with other departments, and guide local transport authorities on typhoon prevention and response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fujian authorities had relocated 156,800 residents as of 7am on Thursday. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Exhibitors at the media preview for Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong on Thursday said they expect an increase in sales this year, as the fair coincides with the release of this summer's Hollywood blockbusters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual event runs for five days from Friday, about the same time as the premiere of "Deadpool & Wolverine" and Disney's "Inside Out 2" in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 142 exhibitors will participate in the event. One of them, Chow, whose stall featured a statue of Deadpool, along with figures, hats, stickers and plushies, said they expect a 30 percent jump in sales this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another stall owner, Ho, told RTHK they will roll out products related to the Transformers franchise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the 40th anniversary for Transformers so we have some highlighted products for Transformers. Also for Marvel, this year is the 85th anniversary for Marvel Comics, so we also have a list of products to sell at this event," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cosplayers dressed as Iron Man, the Hulk, and Jedi from the Star Wars franchise were also enjoying the atmosphere at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai as they posed for pictures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets are priced at HK$42 for adults and HK$20 for children aged 3 to 11. Visitors are required to purchase their tickets via the organiser’s mobile application or at convenience stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over-the-counter tickets will only be available to international tourists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Preterm births and malnutrition in children have increased in Gaza due to worsening conditions over the past nine months, according to a Hong Kong nurse and midwife who has been on the ground with the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krystal So, who recently returned from a month in Gaza, said she encountered dire conditions including overwhelming patient numbers, supply shortages and unsafe conditions for pregnant women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can imagine running a hospital, we need a lot of specific medical supplies, for example, what we wear, what we use for medication. The most urgent need is water and fuel," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So said many healthcare centres had been destroyed by airstrikes which led to an overwhelming influx of patients on a daily basis at the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza where she worked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that Gaza's sealed borders prevented essential medical and daily necessities from reaching hospitals.

    'Higher risk if parent has bipolar disorder'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Chinese University said a study pointed to children more likely to have bipolar disorder, if their parents also have the condition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Findings from the study carried out with the help of 10 hospitals in the Greater Bay Area showed that the risk doubled for children with one or both parents having bipolar disorder, compared with others whose parents don't have the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study also found that the risk of circadian dysfunction is four times higher for teenagers with one or both parents with bipolar disorder, and 7.5 times higher of having symptoms of social anxiety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said this was because these teenagers have significantly lower-than-usual levels of melatonin, which helps with sleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team said their findings form a roadmap of bipolar disorder symptoms which can help with treatment plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Wing Yun-kwok, who heads the Department of Psychiatry at the university, said people with mental illnesses need to learn to live with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think mental illness or bipolar disorder is just like diabetes, blood hypertension, cancer. There's no difference. When you have too high blood glucose, that's diabetes. Too much blood pressure is blood hypertension. So you have too much swing in moods, actually it's bipolar," Wing said.

    Hundreds of construction workers left unpaid: union

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union on Thursday said it has received requests for help from over 500 workers on more than 10 projects, involving some HK$30 million in unpaid wages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The union called on the Labour Department to establish a working group to settle the disputes as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also warned there could be more disputes over pay in the construction industry as the economy slows and there are fewer private projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union said there is a long-standing problem with contractors not paying on time, which causes delays and cash flow problems for subcontractors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biggest problem is what leads to the workers' wages being owed, which is subcontractors not receiving payment. There are many reasons behind subcontractors not receiving payment. It could be about the construction progress; or there are some challenging contracts, which defer payment for two months; or even worse to deliberately be picky on their work, then delaying the subcontractors’ fund for business and wages," said the union's chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union also urged the Legislative Council to quickly pass the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to protect workers.

    Cross-border cord blood arrives at Children's Hospital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Doctors at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital say a five-year-old girl with severe thalassaemia will undergo stem cell transplant surgery in October using umbilical cord blood transferred from the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure can cure the condition and abolish the need for the patient to have a blood donation every four to five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a media briefing on Thursday, the hospital said the blood came from the girl’s younger brother and was moved to Hong Kong last week from a cell bank in Guangzhou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Cheuk Ka-leung, a consultant at the hospital’s department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine, said checks have been conducted to make sure the blood is a match for the girl and safe to use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have proceeded to type the brother's white blood cells to see whether this brother's white blood cells match with the patient and we found that it really matches,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We initiated a lot of communications. We make sure that the quality and the results of testing of the cord blood match our standard and then we proceed to arrange for all the procedures, all the paperwork to get the permit to transport the cord blood to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that the hospital usually searches for cord blood that matches the patient on a local database organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross, but decided to accept a cross-border donation for the first time as sibling donors are always preferred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital said there are currently 10 patients on its waiting list for stem cell surgery.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will visit China for five days from Saturday, Beijing said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At the invitation of Premier Li Qiang of the State Council, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will pay an official visit to China from July 27 to 31," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will be Meloni's first to China since she took office in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will meet with President Xi Jinping as well as Premier Li during the trip, Mao told a regular press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will "hold talks with her... to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common concern," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing would "deepen practical cooperation and cultural exchange," Mao added, as well as "promote the steady and long-term development of China-Italy and China-Europe relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meloni's administration withdrew from the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative last year, but has since sought to mend ties with China, a key trading partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani visited Beijing last year, meeting his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi who said cooperation with Italy had been "fruitful".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, Tajani said Rome intended to strengthen trade despite its withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative. "Our relations with China are positive, even if we are competitors and our positions diverge on certain issues," he told reporters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A dumper truck driver died on Thursday after being pinned between his vehicle and an excavator.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The accident happened at around 9am at a construction site in the Highland Park housing estate in Lai King.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police are investigating the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, a representative of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, said it's believed that the 42-year-old driver was standing behind his vehicle when a moving part of the excavator pushed him down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu stressed the need for machinery to be equipped with sensors that stop operation in emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Sze-kit, chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, noted a recent increase in industrial accidents and urged site managers to make worker safety a priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen a lot of accidents in the past because sites were not well managed and projects were rushed. Safety was ignored because of negligence or deadlines. We urge employers and contractors to always make safety a priority, no matter how urgent the project," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said it is highly concerned about the accident and expressed its deepest sympathy to the man’s family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it had deployed staff to conduct on-site investigations as well as issuing suspension notices to the contractors involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation," the department said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Thursday ruled that Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai has a case to answer in his national security trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He is on trial facing three charges of conspiracy and sedition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence had sought to dismiss the case, citing insufficient evidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the court rejected the bid by the defence and said Lai has a case to answer on all charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also heard that the defendant plans to testify in the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case has been adjourned until November 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai has pleaded not guilty to colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to publish seditious material.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing Secretary Winnie Ho says uncertainty over interest rates put developers off bidding for a subsidised housing plot in Chai Wan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government on Wednesday rejected the only bid for the site on Cheung Man Road, as the tenderer failed to meet the reserve price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plot is earmarked for at least 700 units under the Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme on Thursday, Ho said uncertainty over rate cuts affected developers' interest in the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Initially everyone thought interest rate cuts might be [made] in the middle of the year, around June. But that didn't happen. Now everyone thinks there will only be signs of a downward trend at the end of the year," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary said there was no concrete timetable for putting the site out to tender again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau Chun-kong from the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors said on the same programme that the Cheung Man Road plot is in an ideal location, being as it is near an MTR station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a slope at the site would lead to additional costs, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the government could make the plot more appealing to developers if it reduced the amount of facilities they would be required to build there.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday cut a medium-term interest rate, marking the latest move by the authorities to boost economic growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's central bank cut the rate for its medium-term lending facility (MLF) – the interest for one-year loans to financial institutions – to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC issued 200 billion yuan in one-year loans under its MLF at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time the rate was cut was in August but the latest is the biggest since April 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marco Sun, chief financial market analyst at MUFG Bank (China), said Thursday's move could reduce the cost of financing and release cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unexpected MLF operation was also due to a large amount of MLF loans coming due, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the People's Bank of China cut two benchmark lending rates, days after the Communist Party's third plenary session which outlined major reforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, major commercial banks announced reductions in deposit rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank was cut by 10 basis points to 1.35 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first deposit rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's legendary table tennis player Ma Long and artistic swimmer Feng Yu will carry China's flag at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games opening ceremony on Friday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma, who has claimed three team golds and two singles titles in previous Olympic Games, will be making his fourth Olympic appearance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having led China's artistic swimming team to a silver medal at Tokyo 2020, the 24-year-old Feng looks to dream bigger in Paris. China has made steady progress in artistic swimming in recent years, sealing golds in all five Olympic routines at the World Championships in Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two candidates reflect our recognition of veteran athletes who persist in their careers, as well as the encouragement to the rising events and youngsters," said Zhang Xin, the secretary-general of the Chinese Olympic delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, China has announced a delegation of 716 members, including 405 athletes, for the Paris Olympic Games. 136 male and 269 female athletes will compete in 236 events across 30 sports at the July 26 to August 11 Games. (Xinhua)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 50.22 points, or 0.29 percent, to open at 17,260.83 points on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Traders are taking a cautious stance ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures price index data, which is the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation and therefore plays a major role in its view on interest rates..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight in the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at multi-week lows, with the S&P snapping one of its longest streaks without a daily decline of more than 2 percent, as lacklustre Alphabet and Tesla earnings undermined investor confidence in large company names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

    'Failed tender shows developers want more incentives'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Private Subsidised Flat Pilot Scheme complements the Home Ownership Scheme by bringing in private developers. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763055_1_20240725094635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Professional Property Services, Nicholas Brooke, says a failed tender for a residential plot in Chai Wan on Wednesday suggested the government didn't provide sufficient incentives for developers to take on one of its subsidised housing projects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tender for the Cheung Man Road site was withdrawn after only one bid was received and it failed to meet the reserve price. It involved 700 units with the government setting the price at 65 percent of the market value - with any unsold units being kept by the developer to sell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it's not really a developer-type opportunity," said Brooke, who was speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's more a construction play and if they want to involve the development community then there has got to be more incentive. And I think that that incentive would mean that every scheme of this nature would have to include some private sector units as well, so the developer would be rewarded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said it wants to tender out three sites under its Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme. Announced last year, it is designed to complement the government's Home Ownership Scheme by bringing in private developers to boost building capacity for subsidised homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said the private sector should still be involved in subsidised housing construction but that some changes may be needed from the government given the weak property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they need to look at the backcloth and the general conditions in the market very closely before they go to tender with the next site," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The package needs revisiting if you like. We need to involve the private sector in the production of subsidised housing so the scheme is important. But I think this was a test and I hope the government will learn from that and fine-tune, if you like, the next proposal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said it will continue to assess the market’s development, and may adjust the pilot scheme’s parameters, and future tender arrangements for sites, if such actions are found to be necessary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it would continue to encourage private developers to participate in the pilot scheme under the private land approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the scheme, land can be developed through public tendering or through the use of private land.

 China's ambassador to France said the Paris Olympics will further boost sports and cultural cooperation between the two countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK in Paris, Lu Shaye said China and France can leverage the Games and work together in sharing sports resources and training young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On one hand, China and France can strengthen cooperation on sharing resources on sports where each country excels, like table tennis and diving for China and football and fencing for France,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On the other hand, we can also promote sports education cooperation, encouraging Chinese and French primary and secondary school students to go to each other's country to join summer and winter sports camps.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu also said themed exhibitions will be held at the China House in Paris during the Olympic Games to showcase Chinese cultural traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France. Lu said talks between President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in May brought relations to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The two sides issued a total of four joint statements, on the situation in the Middle East, artificial intelligence, global governance and biodiversity... Nearly 20 bilateral cooperation documents were signed. The China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has been further consolidated and deepened,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The envoy added that Hong Kong plays an important role in promoting people-to-people exchanges between China and France.

 The Observatory says Severe Typhoon Gaemi is moving across the Taiwan Strait and is expected to make landfall over Fujian later on Thursday, maintaining a distance of over 500 kilometres from Hong Kong. It says unless Gaemi adopts a more westerly track after making landfall, the chance of issuing a tropical cyclone warning signal is relatively low.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also says the south-west monsoon over the northern part of the South China Sea will become more active, and depending on the changes in local wind conditions, it will consider issuing the Strong Monsoon Signal.

 Salt Lake City was formally awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics and Paralympics following a vote on Wednesday by the International Olympic Committee in Paris, giving the US state of Utah its second Games after hosting in 2002.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About a thousand sports fans gathered in downtown Salt Lake City in ski gear in the summer heat, while others donned Team USA merchandise and waved flags with the Olympic rings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd erupted in cheers as Olympic officials made their final decision to return to a city where they said the local enthusiasm was palpable even two decades after it first hosted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Utah's capital city was the only candidate for 2034 after the Olympic committee gave Salt Lake City exclusive negotiating rights last year. Climate change and high operational costs have reduced the number of cities willing and able to welcome the Winter Games. (AP)

  The Italian said he was "sad and disappointed" to drop out, adding that he had started feeling unwell on Monday after a practice week in Monaco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After seeing my doctors on Tuesday and waiting an extra day to give myself some more time to see if my condition would improve, things unfortunately got worse," Sinner, 22, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was looking forward to competing with my teammates and the rest of the Italian team, but for now that will have to wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As advised by my medical team, I will now take some time to rest and recover to full health. I'd like to wish the whole team Italia the best for this important event and hope to be back stronger in the future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner said the Olympics had been "one of my main goals for this season" and was due to play in the men's singles and the doubles with Lorenzo Musetti. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said it would consider issuing the Strong Monsoon Signal depending on the progress of Super Typhoon Gaemi, which is forecast to move across Taiwan and make landfall over Fujian later on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said on its website that Gaemi is expected to stay about 600km from Hong Kong before making landfall over Fujian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned that Gaemi will bring strong offshore winds to Hong Kong later on Thursday and early on Friday, along with temperatures of up to 35 degrees or more in parts of the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaemi made landfall overnight in eastern Taiwan's Yilan County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said two people are dead and 201 injured. It's forced the suspension of high-speed railway service, and the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Classes and business operations in 22 counties and cities have been suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Gaemi exacerbated seasonal rains in the Philippines, triggering flooding and landslides that killed six.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first typhoon to make landfall in Taiwan this year, Gaemi was "expected to be the strongest" one in eight years, a government forecaster told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had caused downpours and strong gusts across Taiwan before its arrival, killing one motorist in southern Kaohsiung city who was crushed by a falling tree, and a woman in eastern Hualien, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 200 people were injured by Wednesday evening, while more than 290,000 homes were plunged into darkness due to power outages, disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By 8pm (1200 GMT) on Wednesday, authorities had evacuated more than 8,000 people living in precarious conditions across Taiwan, particularly in Hualien -- a mountainous area with a high risk of landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trains and ferry services were suspended and hundreds of international and domestic flights were cancelled on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that the impact of the typhoon will be extended to four days (until Friday)," said Taiwan's Central Weather Administration chief Cheng Jia-ping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools and offices will remain closed for the second day in a row in several cities -- including Taipei -- with authorities expecting adverse weather to continue across the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaemi is expected to make its way across the strait on Thursday and hit eastern Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, where authorities have issued a red storm alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Gaemi swept past the Philippines, intensifying monsoons that were typical this time of the year and triggering widespread flooding in Manila that turned streets into rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landslides killed six in provinces surrounding Manila, police and disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather authorities in Japan's southern island region of Okinawa urged residents to "exercise strong vigilance" against storms, high waves and floods. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Earnings jitters send Wall Street lower

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets tumbled on Wednesday following a bruising investor response to earnings from Tesla and Google parent Alphabet that added to worries about tech heavyweight equity valuations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downbeat reaction to results "feeds some angst about the mega cap stocks not being able to deliver stock performance," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, adding that even strong results next week from Apple, Amazon and other tech giants may not be received well by Wall Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a general bid to reduce exposure predicated on the idea that these stocks have run up a long way in a short time," O'Hare said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla dropped 12.3 percent after missing earnings estimates as CEO Elon Musk touted progress on robotic and artificial intelligence technology. Analysts said the results added to worries about weakening profit margins amid ebbing demand for Tesla's electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Alphabet fell 5.0 percent after topping analyst estimates in general but reporting disappointing figures for its YouTube business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among economic reports, the sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Federal Reserve's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>

  Besides corporate earnings, Thursday's calendar includes the US government estimate for second-quarter growth. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates, according to government data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New home sales in June came in at an annual, seasonally-adjusted, rate of 617,000, according to data released jointly by the US census and housing departments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was below the 621,000 rate in May, according to Wednesday's revised figures, and under the 640,000 projected by analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure refers to the number of homes sold over a whole year if sales continue at the rate seen in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median price in June was US$417,3000, up 2.5 percent from the prior reading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data follows a report that also showed a drop in sales of previously-owned homes that also missed analyst estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The June report on top of the weak May data show the "spring bounce in sales appears to have reversed," said a note from Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates currently stand below their four-week and 52-week average, according to Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, interest rates remain well above their levels for most of the last decade following a series of large Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to counter inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Fed's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New home sales are expected "to improve slightly" in the second half of the year, according to a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mortgage rates have fallen nearly 50 basis points to about 6.75 percent since early May and we expect rates to fall further as the Fed's rate cutting cycle gets underway," said the Oxford Economics note. (AFP)

    Fan invasion chaos mars Morocco win against Argentina

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Morroco fans threw water bottles on to the pitch after Argentina scored their second goal. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763020_2_20240725081807.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chaos and confusion reigned on Wednesday as Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in their opening game of the men's Olympic football tournament, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Argentina thought they had escaped from the Group B match in Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was completely unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium by now emptied of spectators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a VAR review, and Morocco held on for all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an undignified start to the sporting action at the Paris Games, and a bad day all round for Argentina, whose players were booed as they emerged onto the pitch and during the national anthem by the crowd, most of whom were supporting Morocco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That welcome came after Argentina players were filmed singing racist chants following their victory in the recent Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a circus," complained Argentina coach Javier Mascherano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At no point did they tell us our goal was not valid... this would not even happen in a neighbourhood tournament. It's pathetic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beyond the Olympic spirit, the organisation needs to be up to standard. At the moment it is not, unfortunately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina are looking to win men's football gold for the third time after success in 2004 and 2008, but Mascherano's side trailed 2-0 following a brace by Soufiane Rahimi. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Loganimasi Ponipate of Fiji scores in the Rugby Sevens men’s Pool C match between Fiji and Uruguay at Stade de France. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763019_1_20240725001123.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France struggled to live up to pre-tournament billing as favourites for Olympic Gold in rugby sevens on Wednesday, held to a 12-12 draw by the United States to the disappointment of a packed Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, double Olympic champions Fiji burnished their own title credentials, swatting aside Uruguay 40-12 with typical Fijian flair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Les Bleus side featuring Antoine Dupont, arguably the world's greatest 15-a-side player, were left to rue several errors in possession that opened the door for their lesser-ranked opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France opened their account halfway through the first half, a brilliant offload out of contact releasing Jordan Sepho for a try in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the home crowd was stunned into silence just before the half-time whistle as US flyer Lucas Lacamp broke through the French defence for a long-range effort that earned his team a 7-5 lead at the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France restored their advantage practically from the kick-off in the second half, Rayan Rebbadj powering over after a move that started with a clever Dupont offload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a powerful American counter-ruck after France were caught isolated deep in their half allowed Marcus Tupuola to stroll in for a try that secured them a deserved draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We lacked precision, especially close to the try line. We were knocked back a lot, especially at the start of the match," said France captain Paulin Riva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We didn't manage to finish, messed up every time we should have finished," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result blows open pool C, which also features Fiji, always a force in sevens despite a disappointing season by their standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With trademark free-flowing rugby, the Fijians had far too much pace and power for Uruguay, a Joji Nasova first-half double killing off the match as a contest before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Americans put up a spirited effort, however, with two tries of their own but were no match for Fiji who laid down an impressive marker to the rest of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Australia squeezed past a determined Samoa side 21-14, courtesy of a Henry Hutchison double to get their pool B campaign off to a winning start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other pool B match saw Argentina roundly booed by the home faithful before running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France were billed as the team to beat in the men's competition, with superstar Dupont one of the pin-ups of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fiji have won both Olympic Golds since the sport was introduced at the Rio Games in 2016 and showed they will be no pushover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiji and France will face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what is a wide-open tournament for the men, stiff competition will also likely come from traditional rugby powers New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby's chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a "coming of age" moment for the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has never been a greater spotlight on the sport," Gilpin said ahead of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's tournament starts on Sunday, with Australia and New Zealand well-placed to battle for the gold. (AFP)

    Natural regeneration of forests often better: study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Countries have pledged to plant billions of trees to tackle climate change, but half the time letting forests regenerate naturally would be a better option, a major study said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are places where it makes sense to plant trees, and there are places where it makes sense to naturally regenerate forests," Jacob Bukoski, one of the authors of the study told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to sequester carbon at the lowest cost, some combination of natural regeneration and plantations makes a lot of sense," said the researcher at Oregon State University in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Restoring forests has massive potential to help limit rising global temperatures because trees absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study, which spanned 138 countries and was published in the journal Nature Climate Change, compared the cost and climate benefits of planting one tree species in an area or allowing natural forest regrowth -- two common reforestation approaches --- over a 30-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that in 46 percent of the studied areas, letting forests grow back naturally was the more cost-effective option. The rest of the time, plantations were found to be cheaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It suggests that the current heavier emphasis on plantations within national reforestation programmes could be leading to missed opportunities for cost-effective climate mitigation," the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous research has shown that as much as two-thirds of reforestation commitments in the tropics are plantations, said Bukoski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years there has been "a proliferation of single species plantations to try to meet climate goals," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-growing single species plantations -- also called monoculture -- are more costly to implement but provide revenue from the production and sale of wood products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the wood is harvested, a portion of the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere -- but the rest is trapped in the timber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naturally regenerated forests grow more slowly but are more biodiverse and store a greater amount of carbon over a longer time period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said their mapping could help guide international initiatives and countries' plans to cut emissions by presenting a more nuanced approach to reforestation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found that natural regeneration was especially cost-effective in much of western Mexico, the Andean region, the Southern Cone of South America, west and central Africa, India, southern China, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conversely, plantations proved the better option in large parts of the Caribbean, Central America, Brazil, north, east and southern Africa, northern China, mainland Southeast Asia and the Philippines. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Conflict, economic turbulence and extreme weather scuppered efforts to curb hunger last year, with around nine percent of the world's population affected, UN agencies said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023, a level that has held steady for three years after a steep rise following the Covid-19 pandemic, they said in a report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the picture is uneven. While hunger affected one in every five people in Africa, compared with a global average of one in 11, Latin America and the Caribbean progressed and Asia stalled in the goal of eliminating undernourishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader goal of securing regular access to adequate food for everyone also stalled in that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate or severe food insecurity, which forces people to occasionally skip meals, hit 2.33 billion people last year -- almost 29 percent of the global population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization suggests the UN goal of a world without hunger by 2030 is fading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conflicts, climate chaos and economic downturns are already known as major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that combine with underlying factors including persistent inequality, the unaffordability of healthy diets and unhealthy food environments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But these major drivers are becoming more frequent and intense -- and occurring concurrently more often -- meaning more people are exposed to hunger and food insecurity, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A healthy diet was unaffordable for more than one third of the world's population in 2022, the report added, citing updated estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here too regional inequalities were stark: more than 71 percent of people in low-income countries could not afford healthy diets, compared with just over six percent in high-income nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to David Laborde, an economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization and one of the report's authors, the post-Covid economic rebound was unequal within and between countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wars and extreme weather events also raged unabated in 2023, but the world has failed to put in place a "Marshall Plan" to bolster funds earmarked for fighting hunger, he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN agencies' report, which was presented for a G20 summit in Brazil, suggested a major reform of financing food security and nutrition to alleviate the scourge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would start with adopting common definitions putting all actors on the same page. According to current estimates, between $176 billion and $3,975 billion are needed to eradicate hunger by 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet the "highly fragmented" financial architecture "makes the scale-up and effective implementation of financing for food security and nutrition unfeasible", the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donors, international agencies, NGOs and foundations must coordinate better as the current set-up lacks shared priorities and is characterised by "an over-proliferation of actors delivering mostly small, short-term projects", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food security and nutrition is not simply a question of "distributing bags of rice in emergency situations", Laborde said, but also aid to small-scale farmers and access to energy in rural areas that could electrify irrigation systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another weakness of the current system is that donor intentions do not always meet the needs of populations, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Debates over animal husbandry in some European countries may discourage investment in intensifying it in Africa, which is necessary, said Laborde. (AFP)

 Four teenagers have been arrested after suspicious chemicals and weapons were found on a hillside near a vocational school.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers on Wednesday said the four secondary school pupils, aged between 13 and 15, knew each other, with one of them being a suspected triad member. They were detained for allegedly conspiring to make explosives and possessing them, among other offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said they acted upon receiving a report from the Kwun Tong branch of the Institute of Vocational Education, adding that officers found 90 containers with suspected chemicals at the scene. Police also seized weapons and a number of laboratory equipment like beakers and alcohol burners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As for the motives of those arrested, whether it involved anything political or if they were manipulated by others, and whether there were any other accomplices besides the four, these are what the police are extremely concerned about," said senior superintendent Eileen Chung of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force added that suspected explosives were found in the residence of one of the suspects.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday announced that it had failed to sell a residential site in Chai Wan, after receiving only one tender.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Lands Department said it had rejected the sole bid, as it did not meet the government's reserve price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site on Cheung Man Road was the first put up for public tender under a pilot scheme for private developers to help build subsidised units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site under tender was for not less than 700 residential units, which should be sold at 65 percent of the market price, along with care homes for the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, officials said they would not speculate on why the price was not met, adding many factors, such as market conditions and company strategies, played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government added it would continue to provide more subsidised housing and enrich the housing ladder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will also keep in view the market development, and review in due course if there is a need to adjust some of the key parameters of the Pilot Scheme as well as future tender arrangements for sites under the Pilot Scheme," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will also continue to encourage private developers to participate in the Pilot Scheme under the private land approach."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the government sold a plot in Sha Tin for HK$619 million, the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
