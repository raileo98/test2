    Uvalde families sue 'Call of Duty' gamemaker

<div class="itemFullText">
 Families of the victims of the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, filed two lawsuits on Friday against Instagram's parent company Meta, Activision Blizzard and its parent Microsoft and the gunmaker Daniel Defense, claiming they cooperated to market dangerous weapons to impressionable teens such as the Uvalde shooter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Together, the wrongful death complaints argue that Daniel Defense – a Georgia-based gun manufacturer – used Instagram and Activision's video game Call of Duty to market its assault-style rifles to teenage boys, while Meta and Microsoft facilitated the strategy with lax oversight and no regard for the consequences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta, Microsoft and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, a lobbying group representing the video game industry, said many other countries have similar levels of video game playing but less gun violence than the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," the group said in a statement. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the deadliest school shootings in history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when an 18-year-old gunman armed with a Daniel Defense rifle entered Robb Elementary School and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaints were filed on the two-year anniversary of the massacre by Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the same law firm that reached a US$73 million settlement with rifle manufacturer Remington in 2022 on behalf of families of children killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Meta's Instagram of giving gun manufacturers "an unsupervised channel to speak directly to minors, in their homes, at school, even in the middle of the night," with only token oversight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint also alleges that Activision's popular warfare game Call of Duty "creates a vividly realistic and addicting theatre of violence in which teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease," using real-life weapons as models for the game's firearms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second lawsuit, filed in Uvalde County District Court, accuses Daniel Defense of deliberately aiming its ads at adolescent boys in an effort to secure lifelong customers. (Reuters)

    Runaway emu shocks passers-by in Tin Shui Wai

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rogue emu was spotted pounding the streets of Tin Shui Wai on Saturday morning, shocking residents and rapidly going viral on social media.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Emus are normally found in the Australian outback, rather than Hong Kong public housing estates, but video widely shared online showed one of the flightless birds exploring different parts of the town in the northern New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from the estate, the emu was spotted running up and down busy roads, at one point forcing a lorry driver to slam on the breaks to avoid a collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After calls from people who saw the runaway at the junction of Tin Sau Road and Tin Ying Road, inspectors from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals moved in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined in the search by police officers and officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three hours later, the emu found its way into the nearby wetlands park, where it was caught, uninjured, and handed over to the AFCD for safekeeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say they've so far been unable to contact the farm the emu came from.

    Wide range of mega events a must for HK: minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wide range of mega events a must for HK: minister" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754651_1_20240525115010.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should not limit the kind of mega events it stages, culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Saturday, dismissing concerns that an abundance of shows and exhibitions could diminish their appeal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR has more than100 mega events scheduled for the latter half of this year, from sporting contests to summits, but lawmaker Doreen Kong earlier said she's worried that too many big events would lead to a loss of focus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Yeung said diversity was important to cater to different audiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For tourists, they may be travelling to Hong Kong for a week to participate in a mega event they are interested in...But in Hong Kong, it does seem that 200 mega events are a lot, with all sorts of shows and activities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that Hong Kong is a diverse place with many mega events, and different people who come here can find what they want to take part in. We also want to let everyone know that Hong Kong is capable and has hosted various types of mega events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's mega events are expected to draw 1.7 million visitors, out of a predicted 46 million total arrivals. But the minister stressed that mega events were not the only away to attract tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not solely rely on one aspect to attract people. We already have a number of projects, for example, existing tourist hotspots and in-depth tours. The estimated figure also do not include the number of people attending concerts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we shouldn't only look at the mega events on the roster. It's more about the atmosphere of the city after holding mega events, and making the city more attractive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the administration was in talks with the filmmakers behind the hit local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" about turning its set into a tourist site. The film attracted a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and has sparked international interest in its setting: the long-demolished Kowloon Walled City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister also acknowledged the possibility of the filmmakers requiring the sets again to produce a prequel or sequel to the martial arts film.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmaker Tony Tse says building owners, like those at New Lucky House in Jordan, should be told that they are responsible for the premises' maintenance and repair. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754648_1_20240525111952.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Increasing penalties alone will not be enough to deal with the problem of property owners ignoring fire safety orders, a lawmaker said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tony Tse made the comments after the government said this week that it intended to submit an amendment bill to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who ignore such instructions. It follows the deaths of five people in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan, a building subject to a series of fire safety notices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials are proposing to raise the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tony Tse, who represents the architectural, surveying, planning and landscape sectors, said legislation alone was not the answer and that owners should be informed that they are responsible for carrying out maintenance and repair work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[For] those who have little knowledge or no knowledge about this area, we should all offer some sort of assistance. That could be coming from the government, or some professional institutions, as well as some volunteering persons who have knowledge about it," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Andrew Lam said that while it's "inevitable" that stricter penalties for non-compliance would be introduced, the government should strengthen inter-departmental cooperation to tackle such issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The group behind a 2019 protest song that's subject to a court injunction said on Friday evening that the distributor had now decided to remove it from all platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On social media, the group behind "Glory to Hong Kong" said it has expressed opposition to the decision, saying it hoped to have the song reinstated as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group said the song had been removed from iTunes and Apple Music in various regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeal earlier granted a government request for a temporary injunction against anyone playing or performing the song with seditious intent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, has since restricted the viewing of 32 links related to the song in Hong Kong.

    Alec Baldwin set to face trial over movie shooting

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico judge on Friday rejected Alec Baldwin's bid to dismiss an involuntary manslaughter charge for the 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, opening the way for an unprecedented trial of a Hollywood actor for an on-set death.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Baldwin's lawyers argued at a May 17 hearing that a grand jury indictment of the actor was "a sham" as prosecutors failed to tell jurors they could question defence witnesses and stopped them hearing evidence helpful to the actor's case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among her arguments in a court filing, district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said she did not find prosecutorial bad faith in the grand jury, nor error in jury instructions and prosecutors adequately advised jurors regarding a letter from Baldwin's legal team listing defence jurors they could call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court finds no error in the actions taken by the prosecutor vis-a-vi the reading of the evidence letter," Marlowe Sommer said in the filing
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor now faces a July 10 trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hutchins was shot with a live round after Baldwin pointed a gun at her as she set up a camera shot on a movie set near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The "30 Rock" actor maintains he did not pull the trigger, an assertion that has become central to the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the differences between prosecution and defence positions are factual disputes and that is the type of case juries are meant to decide, said business and entertainment trial litigator Tre Lovell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At trial, Baldwin’s legal team must convince Santa Fe jurors there was a cascading failure in set firearms safety before the weapon was put in Baldwin’s hand,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey has argued in court filings that Baldwin broke firearm safety rules by pointing the gun at Hutchins, cocking it and pulling the trigger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sommer sentenced "Rust" armorer Hannah Gutierrez to 18 months prison in April after a Santa Fe jury found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter for loading the live round into the reproduction Colt Single Action Army revolver Baldwin was using. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 "Black Dog," about a man released from prison who returns home to his remote town in China to rid it of stray dogs before the Olympics, only to befriend one of them, won the Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" competition on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eddie Peng, who stars as Lang in the film by director Guan Hu, attended the ceremony at Cannes along with greyhound Xin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the second prize in one day for Xin, who donned the Palm Dog red collar after being picked for the Grand Jury Prize at a separate ceremony celebrating canine performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Un Certain Regard" jury prize went to the French film "The Story of Souleymane," director Boris Lojkine's feature about a Guinean immigrant's struggle to survive in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best director prize was given to both Italy's Roberto Minervini for "The Damned" and Zambian-Welsh auteur Rungano Nyoni for "On Becoming a Guinea Fowl," while "Norah," by Saudi Arabian director Tawfik Alzaidi, received a special mention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan headed this year's five-strong jury for the competition focused on arthouse films that runs parallel to the main competition, the Palme d'Or.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 18 films in total competing for the prize. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Algernon Yau, left, says Hong Kong businesses can do more to attract investors from the Middle East and Asean countries. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754529_1_20240524143042.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau says claims that Hong Kong was no longer the Pearl of the Orient and its status has been overtaken by Singapore were absolutely not true, citing the SAR’s unique advantage of its proximity to the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s not true at all. Hong Kong has the advantage over the others because we have the back-up of the motherland. We are a super connector and a value adder,” Yau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for commerce and economic development said Hong Kong is positioned to capture business opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, which has a population of 86 million with GDP of US$1.3 trillion. The size of the GBA economy is comparable to that of South Korea or some northern European countries, Yau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Using Hong Kong as a gateway going into the Greater Bay Area is our advantage,” Yau told RTHK’s Your Home Address programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also highlighted that Hong Kong is the only common law city in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The rule of law, free low of capital, good infrastructure and professional services… are all available in Hong Kong which are very competitive to any other economy in the world,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To attract more foreign businesses to operate in Hong Kong, Yau said, “We need to change”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister hailed a business trip led by the Chief Executive John Lee to the Middle East and Asean countries last year, adding that Hong Kong businesses need to look at how to accommodate new investors coming from those parts of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The whole world is changing, the situation is evolving and we have to look at new opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Without changing, we won’t be able to entertain the new investors, visitors or tourists coming from the Middle East especially,” the secretary said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau also revealed that Hong Kong will be hosting a Belt and Road summit in September as part of a month-long Belt and Road festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister, whose policy portfolio also covers broadcasting, said he is trying to foster a more dynamic environment for the industry. He said there are more programmes on RTHK about education and culture on the mainland.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained lost ground on Friday to trade higher ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend, with renewed enthusiasm for generative AI-linked companies pushing Nvidia's share price.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent to 16,920, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,304.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones stabilised after tumbling on Thursday to close almost unchanged at 39,069.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While stocks often rise ahead of the Memorial day weekend, Friday's buoyant trading day also had Nvidia's recent streak to thank, said Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company, which sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in many generative AI products, saw its share price rise 2.6 percent on Friday, leaving it up more than 15 percent this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that expectations were very high, and yet they seem to meet or exceed them on more than one level," he said. "So whether we like it or not, artificial intelligence now is an important factor when it comes to the stock market sentiment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And to the extent that Nvidia's numbers were able to meet or beat expectations that's supportive for the market," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other tech companies that saw their share price jump on Friday include Advanced Micro Devices, which closed up 3.7 percent, and Intel, which finished 2.1 percent higher. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States on Friday announced a fresh tranche of military aid for Ukraine, including ammunition, missiles, mines and artillery rounds as Russia presses its assault on the Kharkiv region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has been battling back in Kharkiv since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States is announcing today a significant new drawdown of weapons and equipment for Ukraine to support the brave Ukrainian people as they defend their country," said Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This 275 million dollar package, which is part of our efforts to help Ukraine repel Russia's assault near Kharkiv, contains urgently needed capabilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, US lawmakers passed a long-delayed US$61 billion military aid deal for Kyiv after months of squabbling in Congress as Ukrainian forces suffered setbacks on the battlefield due to ammunition and funding shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, President Joe Biden has ordered five tranches of military aid to be sent to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Assistance from previous packages has already made it to the front lines, and we will move this new assistance as quickly as possible," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strikes on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, killed at least seven people on Thursday, local authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 11,000 people in the wider region have been evacuated since Russia began its new offensive, according to local governor Oleg Synegubov. (AFP)

    SpaceX mega rocket Starship's next launch on June 5

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The last test took place on March 14, when Starship flew halfway around the planet. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754608_1_20240525004618.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starship, the world's most powerful rocket, is set for its next test flight on June 5, SpaceX announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The launch window from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas opens at 7:00 am local time (1200 GMT), pending regulatory approval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be the fourth test for the sleek mega rocket, which is vital to Nasa's plans for landing astronauts on the Moon later this decade, and to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's hopes of eventually colonising Mars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three previous attempts have ended in the Starship's destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy," SpaceX said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Super Heavy is the booster, while Starship refers to both the upper stage and the two stages combined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flight path will be similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly halfway around the globe before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time around, SpaceX hopes to achieve a soft splashdown for the booster stage in the Gulf of Mexico, and a "controlled entry" for the upper stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Designed to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 121 metres tall with both stages combined – 27 metres taller than the Statue of Liberty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, almost double that of the world's second most powerful rocket, Nasa's Space Launch System – though the latter is now certified, while Starship is still a prototype.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for Nasa and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for Nasa's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the lander vehicle. (AFP)

    Some 45,000 Rohingya have fled fighting in Myanmar: UN

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations warned on Friday that escalating fighting in conflict-torn Myanmar's Rakhine State had forced around 45,000 minority Rohingya to flee, amid allegations of killings and burnings of property.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced in recent days by the fighting in Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships," UN rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told reporters in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "An estimated 45,000 Rohingya have reportedly fled to an area on the Naf River near the border with Bangladesh, seeking protection," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clashes have rocked Rakhine since the Arakan Army (AA) attacked forces of the ruling junta in November, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since a military coup in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA says it is fighting for more autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine population in the state, which is also home to around 600,000 members of the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Rakhine in 2017 during a crackdown by the military that is now the subject of a United Nations genocide court case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over a million Rohingya are already in Bangladesh, having fled past purges," Throssell pointed out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN rights chief Volker Turk was urging Bangladesh and other countries "to provide effective protection to those seeking it, in line with international law, and to ensure international solidarity with Bangladesh in hosting Rohingya refugees in Myanmar", she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Novak Djokovic fell to 44th-ranked Czech Tomas Machac, 6-4, 0-6, 6-1, in the semi-finals in Geneva on Friday ahead of his French Open title defence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, took a wild card to the Swiss clay-court tournament in a bid to reverse an alarming dip in form ahead of Roland Garros where the 24-time Grand Slam champion has won three times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have no reaction right now, I just fought for every ball," said 23-year-old Machac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you play against Novak you just hope. You just try to play your best and see what it looks like."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, bidding to reach his first final of the season, received a medical timeout at the end of the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb will head to Roland Garros where he faces Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the first round having won no titles this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machac, competing in his maiden tour-level semi-final, rallied from a break down in the first set and after failing to win a game in the second powered back in the third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm looking forward to playing in a final for the first time," said Machac who will face two-time champion Casper Ruud or Italian Flavio Cobolli in the title match on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruud, the world number seven, was the runner-up in the last two French Open finals, including a defeat to Djokovic last year. (AFP)

    World Court orders Israel to stop Rafah offensive

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754601_1_20240524214259.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Judges at the top United Nations court ordered Israel on Friday to halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Reading out a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or World Court, the body's president Nawaf Salam said provisional measures ordered by the court in March did not fully address the situation in the besieged Palestinian enclave, and conditions had been met for a new emergency order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive" in Rafah, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court backed a South African request to order Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a week after Pretoria called for the measure in a case accusing Israel of genocide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has repeatedly dismissed the case's accusations of genocide as baseless, arguing in court that its operations in Gaza are self-defence and targeted at Hamas militants who attacked Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli government spokesman said "no power on Earth would stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel launched its assault on the southern city of Rafah this month, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee a city that had become a refuge to around half of the population's 2.3 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the ruling by the ICJ is a blow to Israel's international standing, the court does not have a police force to enforce its orders. In another case on its docket, Russia has so far ignored a 2022 order by the court to halt its military campaign in Ukraine.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers universities in the United States defended their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force, telling a US House committee on Thursday that they defused the danger without ceding ground to protesters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “We had to get the encampment down,” Northwestern's Michael Schill said. “The police solution was not going to be available to us to keep people safe, and also may not be the wisest solution as we’ve seen at other campuses across the country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schill and Jonathan Holloway of Rutgers were called before the House Education and the Workforce Committee as part of a series of hearings examining how colleges have responded to allegations of antisemitism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also testifying was Gene Block, chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, which has come under scrutiny for a delayed police response to violence between pro-Palestinian protesters and counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee’s inquiry expanded to large, public universities, UCLA and Rutgers, after earlier hearings largely focused on private, Ivy League colleges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Philadelphia, protesters packed up their belongings and left a pro-Palestinian encampment at Drexel University after the school announced a decision to have police clear the encampment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  University President John Fry said in a statement that he decided to have campus police and public safety officers join Philadelphia police in clearing the encampment as peacefully as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News outlets reported that police gave protesters a warning to clear the encampment and the protesters left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, hundreds of students in graduation robes walked out of the Harvard University commencement chanting “Free, free Palestine” after weeks of protests on campus and a day after the school announced that 13 students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk” during Thursday’s commencement, referring to allowing those 13 students to get their diplomas along with fellow graduates. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese dog whose photo inspired a generation of oddball online jokes and the US$23-billion Dogecoin cryptocurrency died on Friday, her owner said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She quietly passed away as if asleep while I caressed her," Atsuko Sato wrote on her blog, thanking the fans of her shiba inu called Kabosu – the face of the "Doge" meme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Kabo-chan was the happiest dog in the world. And I was the happiest owner," Sato wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a rescue dog, Kabosu's real birthday was unknown but Sato estimated her age at 18, past the average lifespan for a shiba inu, with her birthday celebrated in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2010, two years after adopting Kabosu from a puppy mill where she would otherwise have been put down, Sato took a picture of her pet crossing her paws on the sofa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She posted that image – with the fluffy shiba inu giving the camera a beguiling look – on her blog, from where it spread to online forum Reddit and became a meme that bounced from college bedrooms to office e-mail chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The memes typically used goofy broken English to reveal the inner thoughts of Kabosu and other shiba inu "doge" – pronounced like pizza "dough" but with a "j" at the end.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said any US sanctions aimed at Hong Kong judges and officials will have no impact on the Department of Justice.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam's comment came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on a number of SAR officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said this was in response to what he described as "an intensifying crackdown on rights and freedoms" in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on his return from an official visit to the Middle East, Lam reiterated his opposition to any such sanctions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we have reiterated many times, these actions and statements violate fundamental principles of international law. Secondly, these remarks or expressions will absolutely not affect me personally or the work of our Department of Justice. They will not have the slightest impact whatsoever," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The justice chief also said he explained Hong Kong's common law system to the business sector in the Middle East during his five-day trip there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there are many opportunities for cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, as the SAR can help connect investors and businesspeople there to China and the rest of the world.

    Lawmakers differ on pushing or shelving waste charging

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday were divided on the way forward for the planned citywide waste charging scheme, with one believing the policy should not go to waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a paper to the Legislative Council, the administration said people who took part in a trial believed the measure was causing a nuisance to the public and complained the designated bags would be too expensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legislator Tik Chi-yuen, from the Third Side, said the city should continue pushing for the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have sufficient conditions to continue with the plan. It doesn't matter what the policy will be called, whether it's a second phase of the trial, or operating it in different modes," Tik told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should introduce this scheme to places with management capabilities, including public housing, subsidised housing, large-scale private residential estates, as well as premises of the government and the public sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But DAB lawmaker, Edward Lau, said the government should shelve the waste charging scheme "indefinitely". He said introducing the policy on schedule would cause chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should hold off on introducing the scheme and look into areas that should be improved. That's because many issues were reflected in the report and it's impossible to fail to deal with them," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when conditions permit and the timing is right, then the government can bring it back to Legco for discussions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok Wai-keung from the Federation of Trade Unions said it could be worth amending the time frame in which to roll out the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other than strengthening our recycling facilities, we hope the government can provide a detailed timetable. If we are going to carry out works on waste charging and reduction, the government should say how many stages should there be," Kwok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said there should be a test run for everyone to take part in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army on Friday continued joint drills surrounding Taiwan Island.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Integrated operations inside and outside the island chain are being conducted to test the command's capabilities to jointly take control of battlefield and launch joint strikes, and to seize control of crucial areas, according to Li Xi, spokesperson for the theatre command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A coast guard fleet conducted law-enforcement drills in the waters east of the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said the drills focused on subjects including verification and identification as well as warning and expulsion to test the capabilities of joint maritime patrol and emergency response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China said the two-day military exercises, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, were launched to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and strongly punish separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end and China will never waver in its resolve to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Xinhua)

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754537_1_20240524151224.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday said a number of people who trialled the pay-as-you-throw scheme think the government should hold off on rolling out the plan to everyone in August, believing the measure was causing a nuisance to the public.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But in a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Environment and Ecology Bureau gave no indication of what would be next for the municipal solid waste charging scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials began trialling the scheme at 14 locations from April, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said the bags were used 70 percent of the time at shopping malls participating in the test run, but there were fewer residents who used them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The average usage rate [of designated bags] at public and private housing buildings ranged from only about 20 percent to more than 50 percent, and only around 20 percent at 'three-nil' buildings," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "three-nil" building is one which does not have an owners' corporation or any form of residents' organisation, nor does it employ a property management company to manage the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said many residents thought charging for disposed waste was causing a nuisance and complained the bags would be too expensive, while voicing concerns that littering would happen more often once the measure took effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also believed it was difficult to understand how to dispose of items larger than the designated bags, the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Residents polled] suggested to scrap waste charging or let society fully understand and prepare for it, thus it is not appropriate to introduce the scheme as scheduled on August 1," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau noted that frontline cleaning staff had seen their workload increase from handling trash that was not thrown out properly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some expressed a concern about conflicts with residents when the policy was introduced or even breaking the law unknowingly, with certain individuals planning to quit because of the scheme, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For restaurants, shops and care homes, they pointed to a rise in operating costs and recommended improving the design of larger garbage bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said certain locations, such as residential blocks, care homes, restaurants and government premises, saw a 10 to 20 percent decrease in the amount of garbage disposed during the test run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added there was a rise in the type and amount of recyclables collected.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian media reports on Friday said more than 100 people were believed to have been killed Friday in a landslide that buried a village in a remote part of Papua New Guinea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The landslide reportedly hit Kaokalam village in Enga province early on Friday morning, about 600 kilometres northwest of the South Pacific island nation's capital of Port Moresby, ABC reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Provincial governor Peter Ipatas told international media there had been a big landslide "causing loss of life and property" amid unconfirmed reports that hundreds may be buried.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He later said that "more than six villages" had been hit, describing the scene as an "unprecedented natural disaster" that had caused "substantial damages".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rapid response team of medics, military, police and UN agencies was dispatched to the area to assess the damage and help the injured. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association on Friday said its chairwoman, Josephine Ip, has resigned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On its website, the association said Ip's move was down to personal reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First vice-chairman Yu Sum-por will take over from Ip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) said it is aware of Ip's resignation and respects the decision made by her and the association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, the SAR government twice criticised Ip for remarks she made in public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, she said an event featuring competitors representing the Hong Kong SAR and Chinese Taipei had lifters from "13 countries".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another incident, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a slip of the tongue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports, and Tourism Bureau on Friday expressed its gratitude to the SF&OC for addressing Ip's blunders, which it described as "completely unacceptable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau again urged the SF&OC to enhance training for its affiliates, to prevent such incidents from happening again.

    DAB calls on govt to shelve waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called on the government to shelve plans to roll out household waste charging, saying surveys it has carried out show this is what the majority of people want.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It added that authorities should not see the policy as the only means to reduce waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said only 18.4 percent of 810 people it polled by phone in April thought the pay-as-you-throw scheme should go ahead as planned in August, and only 15 percent of 750 people polled in May thought the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 30 percent of the interviewees said the policy should be delayed a third time, while 45 percent said it should be scrapped entirely, the DAB said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said people feel there are not enough recycling facilities, and that having to pay for designated bags for waste would be a financial burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said authorities should take more time to help Hong Kong get ready for the scheme, by building waste-to-energy infrastructure, setting up more recycling stations across the city and providing detailed recycling guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the administration can also provide cash rewards for those who recycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have a reward scheme to encourage citizens to [recycle] but now the scheme is that you do recycling and then you get some points, which can be used to redeem noodles or oil, that kind of thing. I think if you can redeem cash, you will have a better incentive," Quat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier in the week that even though the pay-as-you-go measure was made law by the previous administration, authorities should still put thought into how the scheme is executed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown scored a game-high 40 points and grabbed five rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics to a 126-110 victory over the visiting Indiana Pacers on Thursday in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brown was 14 of 27 from the floor and made 8 of 11 free throws. Boston had a 13-point lead after three quarters and the Pacers were never closer than 11 points in the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory gave Boston a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, which will shift to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Saturday. The Pacers have a 6-0 home record in the playoffs this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana point guard Tyrese Haliburton left the game in the third quarter with left leg soreness. He collected 10 points and eight assists in 28 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Siakam made 13 of 17 field-goal attempts and led the Pacers with 28 points. Andrew Nembhard added 16 points for Indiana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum and Derrick White each scored 23 points for the Celtics. Al Horford had six points and a team-high 10 rebounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown led all first-half scorers with 24 points. Boston trailed 27-25 after one quarter but held a 57-51 halftime lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston surged in front thanks to a 20-0 run. The Celtics scored the final three points in the first quarter and the first 17 points in the second quarter to take a 42-27 lead. Indiana didn't score in the second quarter until Aaron Nesmith made two free throws with 6:45 remaining in the quarter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that ripped through a small apartment block in central Hanoi has killed at least 14 people and injured three others, state media said Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The fire broke out at around 12.30am. The fire was big, with several explosions," the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By 6.20am, at least 14 people had died and three were injured, VNA cited local officials as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear how many people were in the flat at the time the fire broke out. The flames were extinguished after an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The building is situated down a two-metre-wide alley, with the top floors of the building rented out, VNA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first floor was reportedly used for the selling and fixing of electric bicycles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A neighbour, who declined to give her name, said she heard an "explosion like fire crackers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought there was a fight, or something hitting the window. I ran down and saw the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of the neighbours had run out of the alley, crossing through other neighbours' houses. We were so, so scared." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished sharply lower on Thursday after blowout earnings by Nvidia failed to ignite a broad rally.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stocks had opened higher, but analysts cited an uptick in US Treasury bond yields as a driver of the reversal. Market watchers also noted a tendency in equities to sell off after big rallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You've had huge runs since mid-April and there's an inclination to take some money off the table," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 1.5 percent at 39,065.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent to 5,267, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 16,736.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, artificial intelligence player Nvidia surged 9.3 percent after reporting a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live Nation Entertainment dropped 7.8 percent after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit, arguing the company, which owns ticketing behemoth Ticketmaster, should be broken up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing plunged 7.6 percent after the company's CFO predicted another quarter of meagre plane deliveries, likely resulting in negative cash for all of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail company VF, which owns Timberland and other outdoor apparel brands, fell 2.9 percent after reporting a US$418.3 million loss in the most recent quarter. The company said a turnround is on track. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754458_1_20240524041833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Justice filed a major antitrust lawsuit on Thursday seeking to break up the alleged monopoly held by Live Nation Entertainment and its Ticketmaster subsidiary in the live music industry.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York, alleges that Live Nation has abused its dominant market position to raise ticket fees, squeeze out competitors and limit choices for fans, venues and artists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators," said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is time to break up Live Nation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticketmaster's pricing practices for concerts and sports events, with high fees and lack of alternatives, have long been a political issue in the United States, with little done historically to open up the market to more competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widespread outages and exorbitant fees caused an uproar, with lawmakers in Washington holding hearings to question Live Nation-Ticketmaster executives over the debacle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move by US officials against Live Nation also came as the Biden administration, according to polls, is seen by voters as failing to do enough to curb inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High prices have become a key issue in battleground states ahead of the 2024 election that pits Biden against former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Live Nation said the lawsuit "won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Calling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, has grown into a US$22 billion global giant that produces over 30,000 concerts annually for nearly 500 touring artists across its network of over 265 venues in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has fought back against allegations it harms the ticketing industry, saying it brought innovation and lower prices because of its national reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the DOJ counters that US fans still pay higher fees with "outdated technology" compared to other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit detailed allegations of unlawful tactics by Live Nation to maintain its dominance, including "threatening and retaliating against venues" by signalling they could lose concerts and revenue if they work with rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 68-page suit paints Live Nation-Ticketmaster as operating a "self-reinforcing business model" that allows it to capture revenue from ticket sales and then use that revenue to lock up artists to exclusive promotion deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It then leverages its access to top performers to sign venues into long-term exclusive ticketing deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fights against Ticketmaster's power go back to the 1990s, when the rock band Pearl Jam refused to perform at Ticketmaster venues in protest at its service charges that increased ticket prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticketmaster was accused of organising a boycott of Pearl Jam's tour, and the band eventually gave up its campaign against the ticketing giant. (AFP)

    Iran's Raisi buried after dying in helicopter crash

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi was laid to rest on Thursday, concluding days of funeral rites attended by throngs of mourners after his death in a helicopter crash, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands marched in his home town Mashhad to bid farewell to Raisi ahead of his burial following processions in the cities of Tabriz, Qom, Tehran and Birjand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 63-year-old died on Sunday alongside his foreign minister and six others after their helicopter went down in the country's mountainous northwest while returning from a dam inauguration on the border with Azerbaijan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once the five days of public mourning, announced on Monday, have passed, the authorities including acting President Mohammad Mokhber will focus on organising an election for a new president set for June 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Men and women, who were mainly clad in black chadors and clutching white flowers, crowded the main boulevard of Mashhad, the Islamic republic's second city in the northeast where Raisi was born.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some held aloft placards paying tribute to Raisi as the "man of the battlefield" as a large truck carrying his body drove through the sea of mourners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have come, O king, give me refuge," said a slogan emblazoned on top of the truck, in reference to Imam Reza, the eighth imam of Shiite Islam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Posters of Raisi, black flags and Shi'ite symbols were erected along the streets of Mashhad, particularly around Raisi's final resting place – the Imam Reza shrine, a key mausoleum visited by millions of pilgrims every year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier thousands of people holding images of Raisi and waving flags lined the streets of Birjand, capital of the eastern province of South Khorasan, for the procession of Raisi's coffin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi was South Khorasan's representative in the Assembly of Experts, a clerical body in charge of selecting or dismissing Iran's supreme leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi had widely been expected to succeed supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who led prayers in Tehran on Wednesday for the late president and knelt before the coffins of the eight people killed in the helicopter crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them was foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who was buried on Thursday in the shrine of Shah Abdol-Azim in the town of Shahre Ray south of the capital. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal was drawn to face world number four Alexander Zverev in a blockbuster opening match at his farewell French Open tournament on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadal, the record 14-time champion at Roland Garros, is unseeded this year after injury saw his ranking plummet to 276.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and Zverev met in the semi-finals of the French Open in 2022 when the German was forced to retire after suffering a serious ankle injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal, the winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, will turn 38 next week and this season will be his last on tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He holds a 7-3 winning head-to-head record against Germany's Zverev with five of those victories coming on clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev, 27, arrives in Paris on the back of lifting the Rome Open title last weekend. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The North Atlantic hurricane season, which starts on June 1, is forecast to be "extraordinary," with between four and seven hurricanes of Category 3 or higher expected, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather agency said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Category 3 storms pack wind speeds over 178 kilometres an hour and wreak devastating damage on houses, uproot trees and often cut off electricity and water for days or even weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This season is looking to be an extraordinary one in a number of ways," said Rick Spinrad of the NOAA, which cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and La Nina conditions in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said human-caused climate change was warming oceans and melting ice on land, leading to sea level rises that worsen storm surges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The forecast for named storms – hurricanes and major hurricanes – is the highest NOAA has ever issued for the May outlook," Spinrad said. "It only takes one storm to devastate a community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oceanic heat in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea creates more energy to fuel storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurricane Ian, which struck Florida in September 2022, caused 152 deaths and losses worth US$112.9 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The man charged with shooting and seriously wounding Slovakia's prime minister said he did so to oppose the government's Ukraine policy but regrets his actions, according to a court document.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovakia was left reeling last week after the head of government, Robert Fico, was struck by four bullets while greeting supporters in the central town of Handlova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was rushed to hospital and underwent two lengthy operations in nearby Banska Bystrica. The hospital on Thursday said that he remains in a "serious but stable" condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged gunman, identified by Slovak media as 71-year-old poet Juraj Cintula, has been charged with premeditated attempted murder and was remanded in custody at a hearing on Saturday.

  "During the interrogation, he stated that since he does not agree with the policy of the current government... he decided to act," pretrial judge Roman Puchovsky wrote in a decision on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accused notably said he disagreed with the government's decision to abolish the special prosecutor's office and to stop sending military aid to Ukraine, as well as alleged media persecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He repeated that he did not want to kill (name redacted) but wanted to wound him and impair his health, that he aimed at his lower torso," Puchovsky wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He realises that he acted completely impermissibly, that he should not have harmed the victim," the judge added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He sincerely regrets his actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attempted assassination has highlighted acute political divisions in Slovakia, where 59-year-old Fico took office in October after his Smer party won a general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now serving his fourth term as prime minister, Fico soured ties with Ukraine after he questioned the neighbouring country's sovereignty as it battles Russian forces. (AFP)

 A tornado that ripped through the midwestern US state of Iowa killed five people and left dozens injured, officials said, with homes smashed to pieces and cars thrown through the air.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Residents surveyed the wreckage of flattened buildings and uprooted trees after the storm left a path of destruction across the town of Greenfield on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Four fatalities and at least 35 injuries were the result of the tornado that impacted the Greenfield, Adair County area," the Iowa State Patrol said Wednesday, adding that the number of injured could still rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The local hospital was damaged and some patients were moved to other facilities, while airlift flights were also undertaken after the storm slammed the town of 2,000 residents 70 kilometres from state capital Des Moines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 100 emergency workers combed through the debris, said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, while local officials reported at least one other person was also killed in nearby Adams County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tornado reports in the United States have been far above average in recent weeks, according to CNN, with more than 800 tornadoes this year making it one of the most active on record. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Thursday said an outbreak of gastroenteritis at the Eastern Hospital has affected at least 43 staff members.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The CHP said the outbreak was likely caused by environmental contamination or person-to-person transmission of norovirus, noting that more than half of the affected staff members work in the East Block of the institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has ordered the hospital to disinfect the area immediately, along with other places the workers visited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the Hospital Authority earlier said some affected workers had consumed food from two hospital canteens, the CHP said not all of them had done so. It added that its officers did not find any irregularities when they inspected the cafeterias.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patients, aged between 20 and 62, are all in stable condition, the CHP added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) on Thursday confirmed that Kam Kee Catering Group has failed to settle around HK$3.1 million in MPF contributions and relevant surcharges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the restaurant chain did not make MPF contributions for around 980 employees between February and March this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MPFA on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in the High Court against the company, on behalf of affected employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reminded employers that it is their legal responsibility to make MPF contributions on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department, meanwhile, said it is handling claims of unpaid salaries and other legal matters from around 60 Kam Kee employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on other workers to get in touch if they have any queries or concerns.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Thursday said a makeover of Sham Shui Po's fabric market could attract young designers and tourists to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sham Shui Po Fabric Market relocated to Tung Chau Street from Yen Chow Street Hawker Bazaar last year to make way for public housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market currently has space for 50 stalls with 30 currently in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The district officer of Sham Shui Po, Paul Wong, said that bright orange reflective panels that had been installed at the venue represent hope for the fashion and design industry in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you're interested in fashion design and DIYs, Sham Shui Po has been your dream destination for many years. Giving these new destinations a push, we can attract more young designers or people who are interested in the design creative industry to come to Sham Shui Po to mingle with other designers and take inspiration," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the beautification project, which they have dubbed "Fabrimark", would bring more exposure and business to the market, while maintaining the textile trade's heritage and history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a strong and long heritage of textile and clothing industry in Sham Shui Po, so riding on the opening of the Hong Kong Design Centre in the fourth quarter of this year, we think this is a good opportunity to combine the new development and our heritage to showcase the fashion design industry, the design industry in general and the textile and clothing heritage of Sham Shui Po."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the beautification work would last around nine months, costing approximately HK$50,000 per month, adding there was an opportunity for an extension depending on its maintenance.

    Drainage Services steps up flood prevention efforts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Drainage Services Department is building a 64,000 cubic metre water storage tank in Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754400_1_20240523171706.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Drainage Services Department said it was taking proactive measures to mitigate the risk of flooding as the rainy season approaches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a press briefing on Thursday, the department stressed that flooding cannot be totally be avoided due to climate change but said it would adopt a multi-pronged approach to reduce the risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides more frequent inspections of the drainage system, it also plans to use artificial intelligence in more scenarios, such as deploying AI-powered robots to clear obstructions in drains and manholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok also said the department was developing an AI analysis tool to gather rainstorm data to help predict floods in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are collaborating with a university team…we need to collect a large amount of data on site to train the computer, to recognise flooding and also to predict it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having to collect the information from [the Hong Kong Observatory] from the coming rainstorm data, we hope the AI model can predict the water depth in the near future during the rainstorms.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration for the media, the department also showcased the construction progress of a storm water storage tank on Sau Nga Road in Kwun Tong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tank is capable of storing around 64,000 cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to 26 standard swimming pools, and is part of a major project to improve drainage in the surrounding area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HK$930 million water storage tank was expected to be completed in 2028 and Mok said the price tag was reasonable given the scale and complexity of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the heavy rainfall, we need to temporarily store the rainwater in the storage tank and wait until the bad weather and the heavy rainfall has gone,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will discharge the rainwater subsequently when the rainfall intensity has reduced…because of the quite large volume of the excavation and the quite large volume of the tank, the cost of the storage scheme is at that level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the department’s ongoing review of flooding black spots would be completed by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Precious Blood Hospital in Sham Shui Po said on Thursday that the institution will remain non-profit making despite its decision to partner up with a private medical group to expand services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Catholic charity Caritas said it will work with Parkway Medical Services to redevelop and expand the 87-year-old hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Joseph Lui, director of medical services at Caritas, said the hospital will remain a Catholic institution, upholding its religious values and mission to serve the local community and the needy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Kenneth Tsang, CEO of Parkway, said new services at the hospital will focus on meeting the needs of the growing elderly population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the community, not just for Sham Shui Po but for the whole of Hong Kong, is becoming more and more of an elderly population. More than 20 percent of our population is elderly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the focus of the hospital will really be on what the people of Hong Kong need. The 20 percent of people who are old, they may have eye problems, they may have ear problems, they may have problems related to the deterioration of age. So those are all the areas that we're going to focus on in the hospital."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital was established by the Sisters of the Precious Blood during the Second World War to provide medical care to the sick and injured.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang will attend a trilateral summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on May 26-27 in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It'll be the first such meeting in more than four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the South Korean presidential office, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will have bilateral talks with Li and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday ahead of their three-way gathering a day later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three countries are expected to adopt a joint statement on six areas, including on the economy and trade, following the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China stands ready to work with Japan and South Korea to implement the trilateral cooperation vision for the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This summit will be a turning point for Korea, Japan and China to completely restore and normalise three-way cooperation systems,” Kim Tae-hyo, South Korea's deputy national security director, told a news conference in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit was last held in December 2019 in China before it was suspended because of the pandemic. (Agencies)

 One person was killed and three others were injured in an explosion in a residential building in Harbin, capital of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.

  <br/>
  Local authorities suspect an exploding gas tank caused the blast which occurred at around 7am on Thursday morning in Xiangfang District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dashcam footage from a nearby vehicle driving along a highway showed a plume of smoke suddenly appearing, and debris strewn across the road, slowing down surrounding traffic.
  <br/>

  The injuries to the three people are not life-threatening.
  <br/>

  Further investigation into the cause of the explosion is underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's president made a long-haul trip to the restive Pacific territory of New Caledonia on Thursday, urging a "return to peace" after deadly rioting, and vowing thousands of military reinforcements will be deployed for "as long as necessary".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Emmanuel Macron arrived in the capital Noumea after a 24-hour flight seeking ways to end more than a week of looting, arson and clashes that have left six people dead and hundreds injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he exited the plane at Tontouta International Airport, the French leader told reporters he wanted to ensure that "as quickly as possible there will be a return to peace, calm, security".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is the absolute priority," Macron added, as he prepared to launch a day of intensive meetings with local leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later, he described the unrest as an "absolutely unprecedented insurrection movement".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one saw it coming with such a level of organisation and violence," he said while visiting a police station in the capital Noumea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Praising security forces for "professionalism" and "cool-headedness", he vowed Paris would "go until the end" to quell the worst violence to erupt in the territory in four decades, warning that "the coming days and weeks will still be difficult".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to spend about 12 hours on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France has ruled New Caledonia since the 1800s, but many Indigenous Kanaks still resent Paris' power over their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since May 13, separatists have cut off whole neighbourhoods and the main route to the international airport, which remains shuttered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nightly riots have seen scores of cars, schools, shops and businesses burned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities have imposed a state of emergency, placed separatist leaders under house arrest, banned alcohol sales and sent around 3,000 troops, police and other security reinforcements to quell the turmoil. (AFP)

    Study shows Chinese calligraphy promotes brain health

Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754363_1_20240523132205.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese University study on Thursday showed that practising Chinese calligraphy can promote brain health, with researchers recommending that people be encouraged to take part in more cognitive activity to prevent dementia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The study involved more than 100 people aged between 55 and 75 who had been practising Chinese calligraphy for an hour a week for a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of the participants doubled their practice time during the study, and the researchers found significant improvements in their brain network connectivity and memory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psychiatrist Allen Lee, who led the research, explained why Chinese calligraphy can stimulate brain function.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you practise, you use your memory because you have to remember the words. You have to pay attention to what you are writing, and you have to have good eye and hand coordination," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You check your work. If you have the chance to practise again, how would you improve it? So you have that kind of reflection."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also suggested that other cognitive activities, such as reading and playing chess or mahjong, have similar benefits, making them a valuable lifestyle intervention to prevent dementia in Hong Kong's ageing population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The risk of developing dementia increases with age. So it's really important that not only older adults, but even those who are now in middle age, start to be aware of the importance of cognitive activities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want people to be aware of brain health and find ways to help themselves to prevent or slow down the risk of developing dementia."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The AI boom has been a huge boost to Nvidia which saw profits and revenues rise considerably. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754360_1_20240523130214.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Nvidia easily beat Wall Street estimates as its profits and revenues skyrocketed, boosted by its chipmaking dominance which has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to US$14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from US$2.04 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue more than tripled, rising to US$26.04 billion from US$7.19 billion in the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The next industrial revolution has begun,” CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centre he called “AI factories” designed to produce “a new commodity — artificial intelligence.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang added that training AI models was becoming a faster process as they learn to become “multimodal” — that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data — and also “to reason and plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company reported earnings per share — adjusted to exclude one-time items — of US$6.12, well above the US$5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Nvidia Corp rose 6 percent in after-hours trading to US$1,006.89.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s stock has risen more than 200 percent in the past year. (AP)

 Officials in Mexico said at least nine people were killed and 50 others injured when a stage collapsed at a campaign event for the Citizens' Movement Party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party's presidential candidate, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, said on social media that a gust of wind caused the stage to collapse at the event in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy enclave near the industrial hub of Monterrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez said he was "ok" after being taken to a local hospital, but that members of his team were hurt. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 33 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter, and the Dallas Mavericks outlasted the Minnesota Timberwolves for a 108-105 win in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals on Wednesday night in Minneapolis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyrie Irving added 30 points on 12-for-23 shooting for Dallas. Daniel Gafford [10 points, nine rebounds] and Dereck Lively II [nine points, 11 rebounds] narrowly missed double-doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 24 points and made 6 of 9 attempts from beyond the arc to lead the Timberwolves. Anthony Edwards finished with 19 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks outscored Minnesota 26-22 in the fourth quarter to help secure the three-point win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas went on a 13-0 run to seize a 97-89 lead with 7:38 to go. Doncic started the run with seven straight points and he finished it with a pair of free throws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota responded with a 10-1 run to grab a 99-98 edge with 4:39 left. Towns hit a 3-pointer from 28 feet to put the Timberwolves on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a timeout, Edwards made a 3-pointer to increase Minnesota's lead to 102-98 with 3:37 to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks answered with back-to-back 3-pointers by Doncic and P.J. Washington to go ahead 104-102 with 1:56 left. Doncic followed with a step-back jump shot to make it 106-102 with 49.2 seconds to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas maintained the lead the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves clung to an 83-82 advantage at the end of the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gafford threw down a pair of alley-oop dunks to start the second-half scoring for the Mavericks. Derrick Jones Jr. followed a couple minutes later with a dunk that put Dallas on top 67-66 for its first lead since the opening quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota led 62-59 at halftime. McDaniels had 19 points before the break, which marked a playoff career high for him in any half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves led by eight in the final minute of the first half, but Irving scored five points in the last 22 seconds to pull Dallas within three. He finished the scoring by converting a three-point play on a basket and a free throw with 0.7 seconds left. (Reuters)

Photo: Courtesy of AllRightsReserved" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754344_1_20240523111743.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of the world’s first Doraemon drone show said it’s no coincidence that Hong Kong was chosen as the launchpad for the event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 15-minute drone show will light up Victoria Harbour this Saturday night, serving as a prelude to an exhibition about the beloved Japanese cartoon series in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition is also the first stop on a global tour and also listed on the government's "mega events calendar".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam from AllRightsReserved told RTHK on Thursday that Hong Kong's multi-generational Doraemon fans impressed him and noted that a similar exhibition held here 12 years ago played a key role in this decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Twelve years ago I saw many four-generation families coming to the exhibition. The previous exhibition had exceeded expectations. We didn't even have the term 'mega event' back then, but the exhibition attracted a significant number of tourists specifically for Doraemon. It was truly impressive,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say it’s like ‘the seeds were planted’ 12 years ago, and what we want is to come back to Hong Kong this time, to show appreciation for this place and also the fans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Japan, Thailand and the mainland were also considered for the first stop of the global tour but Hong Kong eventually stood out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam didn’t give an exact number of estimated visitors to the exhibition but hopes that it could help boost the local economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command on Thursday started joint military drills surrounding Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drills – which began at 7.45am – are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan Island, as well as areas around the islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li Xi, theatre command spokesperson, said military services including the army, navy, air force and rocket force of the theatre command are being organised to conduct the joint drills, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, from Thursday to Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the drills focus on joint sea-air combat-readiness patrol, joint seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, and joint precision strikes on key targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the drills also serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of "Taiwan independence" forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces. (Xinhua)

 Ademola Lookman scored a stunning hat-trick as Atalanta beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 in the Europa League final on Wednesday to win just the second major trophy in their 117-year history and end the German champions' remarkable unbeaten streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lookman, who struggled to establish himself in the English Premier League with Everton, Fulham and Leicester City before reviving his career in Italy under Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini, struck twice inside the first 26 minutes before sealing the win 15 minutes from fulltime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory ended Gasperini's own two-decade long pursuit of major silverware as his side totally outplayed Xabi Alonso's formidable Leverkusen side - or 'Neverlusen' as they had been dubbed after going an incredible 51 games unbeaten.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as they did against Premier League heavyweights Liverpool and three-times finalists Olympique de Marseille in the previous two rounds, Atalanta didn't give their opponents a sniff to mark their first European final with a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen started the game looking decidedly unsure of themselves and some uncharacteristically sloppy play handed the first chance of the game to Gianluca Scamacca, who didn't get enough on his header from a fine Matteo Ruggeri cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an early warning shot and the purposeful Italians struck within minutes when Davide Zappacosta was allowed far too much space down the right before Lookman beat a flatfooted Exequiel Palacios to the cut back to stroke home the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman was mobbed by his team mates and substitutes who were in dreamland 14 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Leverkusen error gifted possession to the Nigeria forward, who skipped past one defender and curled a beautiful right-footed shot into the bottom-right corner from just outside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stunned Germans showed brief flashes of how quickly they can turn it on in attack but little came of it and it was Charles De Ketelaere who came closest on the break as Atalanta did not show a shred of debut final nerves nor any effects from the absence of injured captain Marten de Roon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen swapped defender Josip Stanisic for top scorer Victor Boniface at halftime but it changed little as both sets of travelling fans continued to create the kind of Aviva Stadium noise matched only by some of the Irish rugby teams' famous wins or memorable international soccer nights of years gone by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen had only failed to score once during the run that featured 42 wins in all competitions and 17 goals scored in or after the 90th minute, but the chances of another comeback faded away against the resolute Atalanta backline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman completely extinguished them on the counterattack with another stunning strike into the top corner, this time with his left foot to complete his hat-trick, the sixth in a major European final and first since Jupp Heynckes' for Borussia Moenchengladbach in the 1975 UEFA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was flung into the air by his team mates 15 minutes later when the final whistle blew and the Bergamo club ended the 61-year wait since their 1963 Italian Cup triumph. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday following mixed earnings reports as Federal Reserve meeting minutes highlighted inflation worries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities spent much of the day essentially flat, but tripped into the red after the Fed minutes showed that policy makers were frustrated with the lack of progress in bringing inflation towards the central bank's two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said the concerns were unsurprising given the mindset of the Fed at the May 1 meeting, but that the release served as an excuse for investors to sell after a big rally since the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 39,671.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 0.3 percent to 5,307, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,801, pulling back after two straight records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Target slumped 8.0 percent after reporting a drop of 3.7 percent in comparable sales in the first quarter. The big-box retailer characterised the results as being in line with expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lululemon Athletica dropped 7.2 percent after announcing a number of executive reassignments following the departure of Chief Product Officer Sun Choe, who is leaving for another career opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Moderna surged 13.7 percent after announcing that it had been cleared to present abstracts at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, which begins on May 31 in Chicago. (AFP)

    US says it opposes 'unilateral' Palestine recognition

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said on Wednesday it opposed "unilateral recognition" of a Palestinian state after Ireland, Norway and Spain announced they would establish relations but warned Israel against withholding funds in retaliation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden "has been on the record supporting a two-state solution," his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has been equally emphatic on the record that that two-state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stopped short of criticising the decision to formally recognise the State of Palestine by the three European countries, all close allies of the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Each country is entitled to make its own determinations, but the US position on this is clear," Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has responded angrily, including by withdrawing envoys, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accusing the European nations of offering a "reward for terror."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told Netanyahu that he wants to take retaliatory action including severing an arrangement in which Norway handles funds intended to the Palestinian Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under peace agreements brokered in part by Norway in the 1990s, Israel collects money for the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel has blocked transfers since the aftermath of the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan said that funds should keep going to the Palestinian Authority which the Biden administration wants to strengthen in hopes it can assume control of Gaza from Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's wrong on a strategic basis, because withholding funds destabilises the West Bank," Sullivan said of Israeli moves to stop funds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people which is in Israel's interests, and, I think, it's wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been pushing Israel to move forward on a timeline for a Palestinian state, in part by dangling the prospect of Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Washington vetoed a recent UN Security Council bid to recognise the State of Palestine, saying that recognition could only come through negotiations that take into account Israel's security interests. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic celebrated his 37th birthday on Wednesday with a much-needed win as he gears up for his French Open title defence, progressing to the Geneva quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one downed Germany's Yannick Hanfmann 6-3, 6-3 in the second round at the Parc des Eaux-Vives grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic took a wild card to play in Geneva in a bid to rescue an alarming dip in form ahead of next week's French Open, the second Grand Slam of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd sang "Happy Birthday" to Djokovic as a cake with candles was brought out onto the court following his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lifted the cake and showed it off to the crowd, having a nibble before offering some to the ball boys and girls. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge in Tennessee on Wednesday temporarily halted a foreclosure sale of Graceland, the historic home of Elvis Presley in the southern US state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The auction of the property had been scheduled to take place on Thursday but was paused by Shelby County Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presley's granddaughter, actress Riley Keough, had filed a lawsuit seeking to block the sale of the sprawling estate in Memphis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A company called Naussany Investments & Private Lending was seeking to auction off Graceland, claiming that Keough's mother, Lisa Marie Presley, had put it up as collateral in 2018 for a US$3.8 million loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis's only child, died in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keough, 34, who starred in "Mad Max: Fury Road" and "The Girlfriend Experience," claimed in her lawsuit filed on May 15 that the loan documents were fraudulent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jenkins said he was halting the auction until a trial can be held to determine the authenticity of the documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court will enjoin the sale as requested," the judge said at a live-streamed court hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The real estate is considered unique under Tennessee law and, being unique, the loss of the real estate would be considered irreparable harm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc welcomed the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims," it said in a statement. "There will be no foreclosure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Graceland will continue to operate as it has for the past 42 years, ensuring that Elvis fans from around the world can continue to have a best in class experience when visiting his iconic home." (AFP)

    British PM Rishi Sunak sets July 4 election date

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday set July 4 as the date for a national election that will determine who governs the UK, choosing a day of good economic news to urge voters to give his governing Conservatives another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speculation about an imminent election had mounted throughout the day after Sunak called a Cabinet meeting for Wednesday afternoon – rather than the usual Tuesday – and Foreign Secretary David Cameron flew back early from a trip to Albania to attend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak’s centre-right party has seen its support dwindle steadily after 14 years in power. It has struggled to overcome a series of crises including an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders in the past two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour Party is strongly favoured to defeat Sunak’s party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain must hold a national election by January 2025, and Sunak has repeatedly said it will be in the back end of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stuck to that line on Wednesday, answering a lawmaker’s question about whether there would be a summer vote: “Spoiler alert: There is going to be a general election in the second half of this year.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Olympic swimming champion David Wilkie has died at the age of 70, his family said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wilkie, who won 200 metres breaststroke gold for Great Britain at the 1976 Games in Montreal, died on Wednesday after suffering from cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great sadness that the family of David Wilkie MBE announce that he died peacefully surrounded by his family this morning, following his brave battle with cancer," his family said in a statement released to Britain's Press Association news agency:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wilkie also won two Olympic silver medals and three world titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1954 to Scottish parents, Wilkie won his first major medal with a bronze at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, representing Scotland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first World Championship gold followed in 1973 in Belgrade, and two years later he won both 100m and 200m breaststroke titles in Cali, Colombia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his finest performance came at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal where Wilkie, who had been training and studying at the University of Miami, broke the US dominance of Olympic swimming by winning 200m breaststroke gold with an outstanding swim, breaking the existing world record by over three seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the only non-American to win a gold in the men's swimming events in Montreal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wilkie retired from competitive swimming soon after the Games, at the age of 22, and subsequently became a successful businessman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is survived by his wife, Helen, and children Natasha and Adam. (AFP)
