 Police said five people were arrested near West Kowloon Court on Thursday for alleged disorderly conduct in public places
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said four people, aged between 32 and 68, failed to follow instructions when they entered the court building. They also ignored officers' verbal warnings and chanted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force added that they arrested another 32-year-old man after he chanted inside the court area and refused to cooperate with officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five suspects are detained on suspicion of engaging in disorderly conduct in a public place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police reminded members of the public to abide by the law and express their views in a peaceful and orderly manner, without undermining national and public security.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday hit out against foreign criticism of the landmark court ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in the capital, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Beijing strenuously opposes attempts by foreign countries to use this case to interfere in China’s internal affairs and smear Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one can engage in unlawful activities in the name of democracy and then try to escape legal sanctions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokeswoman added that the central government firmly supports the SAR’s law enforcement and judicial authorities in fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that violated national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came after the United States, European Union and Australia described the trial as being "politically motivated", and called for those convicted to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  14 people were convicted earlier in the day of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law, after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by plotting to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two others were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  31 other defendants, meanwhile, had already pleaded guilty in the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said the court ruling on a national security trial confirmed there was a conspiracy to commit subversion, which also showed the seriousness of the case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Lee said the judgement handed down by a three-judge panel showed there was a conspiracy to subvert state power and to destroy and overthrow the existing political system and structure established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the convictions of 45 of the 47 defendants showed the scale and severity of the plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 16 who pleaded not guilty, 14 were convicted of conspiring to commit subversion and two were acquitted. Thirty-one others pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that the Department of Justice had indicated its intention to appeal against the acquittals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR is duty-bound to safeguard national security, and is determined to fight any acts that compromise this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the subversion saga had harmed Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no winner out of this case. This is a very sad story that some Hong Kong people tried to conduct subversion of Hong Kong. I think it is good that we were able to interdict the plot so that the Hong Kong citizens will not suffer and Hong Kong will now resume to a normal state," he told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 and said it would remain in effect until at least 6am on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a tropical cyclone located about 800 kilometres from Hong Kong could affect the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad area of low pressure in the South China Sea has become a tropical depression, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said strong winds were not expected to have a significant impact on the region yet, but the tropical depression could move closer to the coast and strengthen slightly during Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would assess the need to issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 based on the storm's intensity, as well as local wind conditions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Thursday announced its intention to appeal against the acquittal of two of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were among 16 defendants who pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a verdict delivered on Thursday morning, the judges said they were not sure if Lau and Lee had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the lunch break, Director of Public Prosecutions Maggie Yang told the court that the Department of Justice intends to appeal using the amended Criminal Procedure Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She requested that the pair be kept on bail, pending a decision on the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee's defence counsel argued against that, saying his client should be a "free man" unless the court grants the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-judge panel decided to extend the bail of Lau and Lee. They are now required to report to police on a monthly basis, instead of twice every week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also said mitigation hearings for those convicted are scheduled for June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the media, chief superintendent Steve Li from the police's National Security Department welcomed the conviction of 14 defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the judgement, you can see that the court regarded this as a very serious case. This is a very illicit plot... The ultimate goal is to paralyse the government," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran opened a five-day registration period on Thursday for hopefuls wanting to run in the June 28 presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier this month with seven others.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The election comes as Iran grapples with the aftermath of the May 19 crash, as well as heightened tensions with Israel and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The period would see those between the ages of 40 to 75 with at least a master's degree register as potential candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All candidates ultimately must be approved by Iran's 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That panel has never accepted a woman nor anyone calling for radical change within the country's governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is unlear who will run. The country’s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front-runner, because he's already been seen meeting with Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day registration period will close on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guardian Council is expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June. (AP)

 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 at 5.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea will soon develop into a tropical depression. It is expected to gradually move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory added that there will be squally showers and thunderstorms in the coming days, while winds offshore and on high ground will strengthen.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electronic queuing systems for taxis have been brought in at the arrival hall to reduce queues during extreme weather, the Airport Authority said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven Yiu, the executive director of airport operations, said the system was introduced in March this year after people had to queue for hours last year during a typhoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a mobile phone notification or the airport's information board would now tell passengers when their taxi was ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to avoid a long queuing for prolonged-waiting passengers. For example, if the typhoon lasts three to four hours, we don't let the passengers keep queuing for long periods of time, so we give them some sort of queuing number so they can stay in the restaurant and also rest until being called forward to the taxi station," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We created a resting area, actually it is a large area with over 500 chairs, with Wifi [and a] charging facility. We will also distribute water, biscuits to them, and also some blankets as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority hopes to make passengers feel comfortable, especially when taxis and Airport Express trains can't operate under Typhoon Signal No 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three judges presiding over a subversion trial centred on an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations said in their ruling on Thursday that two of the defendants were acquitted because they were not sure if the pair had the intention to subvert state power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the judgement, former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun never advocated vetoing government budgets in the election forum they had attended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution argued during the trial that the suspects planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure to be introduced by the government, had they become Legco members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, the judges said although Lau's name appeared on a declaration of poll candidates, they were not sure if he had signed it himself or authorised someone to sign it on his behalf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the "Inked without Regret" declaration agreed to use the vetoing power of lawmakers to force the chief executive to respond to the five demands of protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a fact that [Lau] did not post the [declaration] on his Facebook page and he did not make use of the [declaration] in his electioneering work," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said although the now-disbanded Civic Party, which Lee belonged to, endorsed the declaration, he was not yet a candidate at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also noted that Lee had asked his election team to come up with a new pamphlet that did not mention the five demands after looking at the national security law, which took effect in June 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released after the verdict at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still other defendants in this case, warranting our concern and even love," Lau told reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's any star in this case, this judgement should be the star. It sets the jurisprudence, reasoning, logic, perspectives of our judges. Please study it. This is more important than any single individual of this case. This is part of our rule of law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the first thing he'd like to do was to have a meal with his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel calm, as I have always been... Thank you to everyone who have been concerned about us and expressing your care. We all can feel that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there is a tendency for the prosecution to apply for an appeal, so I cannot make any comment on this case at this moment."

    Use of force not necessary for subversion, court finds

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The court ruled that those who intentionally commit an act that contravenes the national security law with the intent to subvert state power don't have to use force or know they're breaching the law to be found guilty." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755349_1_20240530121750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landmark ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date has set out that those who plot to subvert state power need not use force or employ criminal means to be found guilty of breaching the national security law (NSL), nor do they need to know that their tactics were unlawful.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan laid out their reasoning in a 319-page judgement, which found 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion while acquitting two. Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges concluded that those convicted had taken part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government by unlawful means with a view to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court found that they had planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure request by the government if they win a majority in the Legislative Council election in 2020, to compel the chief executive to accede to demands made by anti-government protesters or be forced to dissolve the legislature and resign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges rejected arguments by defence lawyers that "unlawful means" necessitates the use or threat of force; that guilty parties must know that what they were doing was illegal; and that Legco members who veto government budgets are merely exercising their constitutional duty instead of breaking the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ruling, the judges noted that the NSL was drafted with the understanding that national security in the city could be undermined not only by force, but also by non-violent actions such as advocating Hong Kong's independence, inciting public hatred, and paralysing the work of the government and legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said limiting "unlawful means" to acts of force would be such a narrow interpretation that "would be absurd and illogical and defeat the purpose of the NSL".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also swept aside defence arguments that "other unlawful means" should only include criminal acts, saying it’s “inconceivable that acts or activities by whatever forms and methods with a view to subverting the state power could be considered to be acceptable or tolerable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moreover, they ruled that the defendants did not have to be aware that they were breaching the law at the time of the offence, so long as the accused had intentionally committed an unlawful act with a view to subverting state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Therefore, it was irrelevant to the issue of guilt that the accused acted with a mistaken belief that his or her means was lawful; to hold otherwise would go against the purpose of the NSL,” the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the judges agreed that legislators should not automatically approve government budgets, any plan to indiscriminately veto such budgets in an attempt to force the government to accept political demands would, they concluded, constitute an abuse of power that contravenes both the Basic Law and the NSL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also dismissed defence claims that the offence wasn’t clearly defined because the law doesn’t provide specific definitions for "subversion" or "state power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said it was obvious that all the powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ultimately came from the Constitution and the Central People's Government, and concluded that "state power" refers to those wielded by the SAR government, including the various duties and functions it performs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a dictionary definition of "subversion", the judges ruled that “a serious interference in, disruption or undermining of the performance of duties and functions in accordance with the law by the body of power of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region… could amount to an act ‘subverting the State power’.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, they found that 14 defendants had knowingly participated in the plot, with the intention of subverting state power, and therefore found them guilty.

    FS hopes for stronger ties between China, US bay areas

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has told the business community in Berkeley, California that he hopes there will be further financial and technological exchanges between the state's bay area and the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and the University of Hong Kong both signed a memorandum of understanding with a California-based climate institute to cooperate in areas such as talent exchanges, green fintech and carbon market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope, too, that we can encourage financial and technological exchanges. The global gap for green funding and technology is enormous, measured in trillions of US dollars. Let's turn this need into opportunities,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to say that Hong Kong is a great place to do business in Asia, being the "super connector" between China and the rest of the world, and invited US businesses to pay a visit to the SAR to see what is on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also told attendees at a climate event that Hong Kong is committed to a greener future and that the SAR plans to reach carbon neutrality in the coming decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are adopting a four-pronged strategy to reach neutrality: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Indeed, we were among the first cities in Asia to take action against climate change… Our carbon emissions peaked in 2014 and have shown a general downward trend since.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military officials on Thursday said North Korea fired a barrage of suspected ballistic missiles toward its eastern sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The missile launch comes days after its attempt to put a military reconnaissance satellite into orbit ended in failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the North firing around 10 projectiles that appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles from an area near its capital, Pyongyang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the suspected missiles flew around 350 kilometres before landing in waters off the North’s eastern coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the South Korean military had increased surveillance and shared its information with the United States and Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan’s coast guard issued a maritime safety advisory over the North Korean launches
  <br/>
  and urged ships to exercise caution if they find any fallen objects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters the suspected missiles were believed to have landed in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone and there were no immediate reports of damages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Tokyo “strongly condemns” the launches, which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North. (AP)

  China is this week hosting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and several other Arab leaders for a forum at which discussions on the war in Gaza were expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the delegations, Xi said China supported a "broad-based" peace conference to resolve the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Middle East is a land bestowed with broad prospects for development, but the war is still raging on it," Xi said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 if a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea develops into a tropical depression.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the low-pressure area is still loosely organised but may intensify. It is expected to move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that there will be showers, thunderstorms and strong winds in the coming days, while offshore winds will also strengthen.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The group in charge of promoting patriotic education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee on Thursday said it is going to hold design contests in which participants create mascots and logos that reflect the theme of "love our country, love Hong Kong, and love our community."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The competitions would be held in separate primary, secondary, and tertiary divisions. The winning design could be used in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners and the first and second runner-ups would also receive annual passes to the Hong Kong Palace Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registration for the competition starts today and will close on July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's convenor, Starry Lee, said all schools in the SAR would be invited to join the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have designed a theme that is ‘to love our motherland, to love Hong Kong and to love the community’. We need a logo or symbol to represent this main theme. We will issue a letter to all schools in the community, including universities, secondary and primary schools, to invite all schools to join and participate in this competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hopefully, we can find some very symbolic design so that we can use in other part of our activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while participation is voluntary, she expects a lot of students would join the contests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by participating in a unsanctioned 'primary election' organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two others – former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun – were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those convicted in the subversion case were Gordon Ng, Tat Cheng, Clarisse Yeung, Michael Pang, Kalvin Ho, Helena Wong, Sze Tak-loy, Gwyneth Ho, Raymond Chan, Owen Chow, Lam Cheuk-ting, Leung Kwok-hung, Ricky Or and Winnie Yu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were remanded in custody, pending sentencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict was handed down by three national security judges in a hearing at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at Queen Mary Hospital since October. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say the robot can help surgeons be more precise and accurate when placing screws, and thus reduce the risk of complications and the need for more surgery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jason Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong's medical school, led the research team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say there are a couple of aspects that it improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First it of course increases patient safety. So in the past when we are doing the surgeries, where we insert the screws, they are all done by free hand, meaning that it is up to the surgeons' experience to identify where the correct position is for the screws...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secondly, it helps the surgeon with the overall process of the surgery. Surgeons no longer need to be completely concentrated to put screws in accurately. They can actually put their major part of the concentration into more risky procedures, such as decompression of the nerves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Cheung said surgeons would still remain in overall control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So even to this day when I am using the robot, despite it guiding me, I will still always check whether the track of the screws are correct or not. So I will always double-check myself by feel, perhaps an X-ray just to confirm whether everything is accurate," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Cheung said the robot didn't just help with inserting the screws. He said, prior to surgery, surgeons would take a CT scan from the patient and plan where to put the screws. The system would then match this with the plan and guide the surgeon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court is set to begin delivering a verdict on whether 16 opposition figures breached the national security law by participating in an unofficial legislative primary election four years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Queues formed outside the West Kowloon Court where the hearing is held amid tightened security and a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixteen defendants who have pleaded not guilty are expecting to hear their fate after a subversion trial lasting 118 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, they could face up to life in prison although sentencing is expected later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among the 47 politicians and activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities alleged that an unofficial Legco primary election in July 2020 was a subversive attempt by the opposition camp to win a majority in Legco and paralyse the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 16 who stood trial include former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, and journalist-turned-activist Gwyneth Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was centred on whether they conspired to subvert state power by planning to indiscriminately vote down the budget and force the then-Chief Executive to resign through their participation in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others, including former legal scholar Benny Tai and ex-student activist Joshua Wong, pleaded guilty to their charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judiciary has set aside more than 400 seats for the public to hear the verdict on Thursday - the largest national security case to date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three national security judges - Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan - presided over the jury-free trial.

    Prosecutors drop assault charges against Scheffler

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prosecutors in Kentucky on Wednesday dropped all charges against top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler, who was arrested after allegedly ignoring police at a traffic stop outside the US PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, 27, was handcuffed and led away by officers in the pre-dawn incident on May 17, before having his mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit and then returning from jail to the Valhalla course and teeing off for his second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler allegedly drove onto a curb near the course entrance after police set up a traffic stop due to a separate road accident in which a local man working at the tournament had been killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police report said Scheffler had disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging to the ground police officer Bryan Gillis, who was hospitalized with bruising and swelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell lodged a motion in court to dismiss all charges against Scheffler and the judge agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court that the evidence against Scheffler did not meet the standard of probable cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on the totality of the evidence my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr Scheffler," O'Connell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler had been charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Steve Romines denied any wrongdoing, adding Scheffler was driving a marked player's vehicle when he received conflicting signals from police officers at the traffic control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romines had stressed that his client would fight the charges and was "not interested in any sort of settlement negotiations or anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the morning of his arrest, world number-one Scheffler released a statement saying "there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court in Louisville that Scheffler's claim of misunderstanding "is corroborated by the evidence." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Japan's Naomi Osaka in action during her second round defeat. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755308_1_20240530084305.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek escaped from match point down against Naomi Osaka to reach the French Open third round on Wednesday, while Carlos Alcaraz overcame a scare of his own as persistent rain caused widespread disruption to the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swiatek outlasted fellow four-time Grand Slam winner Osaka 7-6 [7/1], 1-6, 7-5 in a breathtaking second-round clash, livening a gloomy day in which 23 singles matches were postponed until Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Swiatek won the last five games of the match to keep her bid for a third successive Roland Garros title on track. Justine Henin was the last woman to achieve the feat in 2005-07.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Osaka, appearing at only a second Grand Slam since giving birth to her daughter last July, was on the cusp of her biggest win since returning to tennis at the start of the year but took a philosophical view to an agonising defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three break points eluded Swiatek to start the deciding set and Osaka's clean hitting quickly had her opponent again on the back foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Osaka blasted a backhand winner to break for a 2-0 advantage before demonstrating her resolve once more to save another five break points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek fended off a break opportunity to stay in touch at 2-4, but she looked doomed when Osaka brought up match point three games later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A terrific return kept her alive and a loose backhand from Osaka handed Swiatek a break to get back to 4-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a tough hold, Swiatek broke again to move 6-5 in front before holding her nerve to wrap up victory after nearly three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion and third seed Coco Gauff defeated Slovenia's Tamara Zidansek 6-3, 6-4, while eighth seed Ons Jabeur overcame Colombia's Camila Osorio in three sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz shook off a third-set blip against world number 176 Jesper de Jong before the Spaniard came through 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 under the roof on Court Philippe Chatrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the men's draw were Second seed Jannik Sinner, Sixth seed Andrey Rublev and former French Open finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas. (AFP)

    Interest rate fears take shine off US markets

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Wednesday as rising Treasury bond yields prompted a wave of selling after recent records.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Now that the (first-quarter earnings) period is essentially over, inflation and interest rates are front of mind," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, noting that the Dow has pulled back after topping 40,000 earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 percent on the day to 38,441.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.7 percent to 5,266, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6 percent to 16,920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have attributed the rise in Treasury yields partly to commentary from US Federal Reserve officials warning that elevated inflation could keep interest rates high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market observers have also cited disappointing demand for US Treasury bonds as a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Fed's latest "beige book" of economic conditions pointed to a somewhat gloomier outlook, although economic activity remained positive from early April to mid-May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Marathon Oil shot up 8.4 percent after it agreed to be acquired by ConocoPhillips in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ConocoPhillips declined 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Airlines sank 13.5 percent after it lowered its profit outlook, citing weaker demand and a troubled booking system upgrade. (AFP)

    Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula hit by fresh eruption

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new volcano erupted on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland on Wednesday, spewing red-hot lava into the air shortly after authorities evacuated the nearby town of Grindavik.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A large white cloud of smoke could be seen, with orange lava fountains bubbling out of a crack in the ground near Sundhnukagigar, north of Grindavik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption was the fifth in six months on the Reykjanes peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two hours after the start of the eruption, lava was flowing less than a kilometre from a defensive barrier protecting the fishing village of Grindavik, the barrier itself located about another kilometre from the northern tip of the town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the 4,000 residents had evacuated Grindavik in November, prior to a December eruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lava flowed into the town's streets during another eruption in January, engulfing three homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the large share of those who were in the town on Wednesday -- for work or visits -- left immediately, a few die-hard residents refused to leave, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite recommendations from response teams to leave the town, three residents remain in Grindavik. Such actions are not advisable," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nearby Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, Iceland's biggest tourist attraction known for its turquoise waters, said it had evacuated its facilities on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maia Biegatch, a 28-year-old French tourist, had just arrived at the Blue Lagoon when the eruption occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We received alerts on our phones telling us to 'evacuate, evacuate', so we turned back," she told AFP. "It was a total surprise."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption was, however, not expected to disrupt air traffic, with the international airport Keflavik "open and operating in the usual way", airport operator Isavia said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The eruption cloud reached an altitude of about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) at the beginning of the eruption" and the length of the fissure was estimated at over one kilometre, the Iceland Meteorological Office said shortly after the eruption began at 12:46 pm (1246 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 90 minutes later, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management said the fissure had extended to 3.4 kilometres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lava flow was heavy, estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000 cubic metres per second, the IMO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption came almost three weeks after the end of a previous eruption that had been ongoing since March 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past six months, volcanoes have erupted on the peninsula in December, January, February and March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMO had reported "intense earthquake activity" prior to Wednesday's eruption, with "about 400 earthquakes" measured in the past seven days near the Sundhnukagigar crater row. (AFP)

    BHP abandons bid for Anglo American

    <![CDATA[<img alt="BHP has scrapped a huge takeover offer just before a key deadline. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755279_1_20240530014949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's BHP announced on Wednesday that it has walked away from a proposed US$49-billion takeover of British rival Anglo American that would have created a copper titan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BHP said in a statement that it will not make a firm offer for Anglo American, ending a six-week saga and scrapping its gigantic proposal just before a key Wednesday deadline which its UK rival had refused to extend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A core part of BHP's plan was splitting off Anglo's platinum holdings in South Africa, a politically sensitive move that stirred government opposition ahead of the country's general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's offer had also proposed Anglo American hiving off its iron ore production activities in South Africa under plans to focus on copper, demand for which is booming over its use in green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP will not be making a firm offer for Anglo American," BHP chief executive Mike Henry said in a statement bringing an end to their efforts, which had seen the Australian company twice raise its initial proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we believed that our proposal for Anglo American was a compelling opportunity to effectively grow the pie of value for both sets of shareholders, we were unable to reach agreement with Anglo American on our specific views in respect of South African regulatory risk and cost."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP remained confident however that its plan "was the most effective structure to deliver value for Anglo American shareholders" and could have "obtained all required regulatory approvals, including in South Africa", he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-listed giant had rejected a third offer from BHP last week, worth 38.6 billion pounds, but agreed to keep talks alive for seven more days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to BHP's overtures, Anglo had recently announced it would offload its coal, diamond and platinum businesses to focus on critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Wednesday, Anglo American had rejected BHP's request to extend talks over its vast proposal beyond a 1600 GMT deadline for it to either make a concrete offer or abandon the bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said its board had unanimously concluded that there was "no basis for a further extension" for BHP to explore its proposal, adding that there were "fundamental concerns" over the bid structure and value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offer "includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure", Anglo American argued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the deadline, BHP -- which is listed in London and Sydney -- had made a last-ditch attempt to mollify concerns and keep its bid alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP believes that its proposal will contribute to South Africa and allow the benefits of South African mining to be shared with more South African stakeholders," the company had insisted in its previous statement as it requested a further deadline extension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any deal between two of the world's largest resources companies would have fundamentally reshaped the sector, with far-reaching consequences for commodities markets and the global energy transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's interest was largely stoked by its hunger to secure a reliable copper supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anglo American's South American copper holdings include four of the largest copper mines in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An electrical conductor used in wiring, the metal is seen as a bedrock of emerging clean-energy industries -- a crucial component to manufacture solar panels, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also widely regarded as vital for the development of cutting-edge AI technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copper prices have increased about 400 percent in the past quarter of a century, and broke US$10,000 a tonne in April for the first time in two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boom has already prompted a wave of investment, with BHP snapping up Australian copper producer OZ Minerals for more than US$6 billion last year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Wednesday announced the creation of an "AI Office" of tech experts, lawyers and economists to regulate artificial intelligence under a sweeping new law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU this year approved the world's first comprehensive rules to govern AI, especially powerful systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT after long, intense negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First proposed in 2021, the bloc raced to get the law in the books after ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, leaving users stunned by its ability to churn out coherent text including poems within seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The AI Office aims at enabling the future development, deployment and use of AI in a way that fosters societal and economic benefits and innovation, while mitigating risks," the European Commission said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 140-member AI Office will be established within the commission, which is the EU's executive arm and also acts as the bloc's powerful tech regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Office will foster a European AI ecosystem that is innovative, competitive and respectful of EU rules and values," the EU's top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's law known as the "AI Act" has tougher rules for general-purpose AI systems such as ChatGPT and takes a risk-based approach to the technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher the risk to Europeans' rights or health, for example, the greater the systems' obligations to protect individuals from harms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with developers and a scientific community, the office will evaluate and test general purpose AI to ensure that AI serves us as humans and upholds our European values," commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies will have to comply with the EU's law by 2026, but rules covering AI models like ChatGPT will apply 12 months after the law becomes official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's announcement came on the same day that EU auditors criticised the commission for failing to sufficiently invest in AI to achieve the bloc's ambitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, stronger governance and more -- and better targeted -- public and private investment in the EU will be paramount if the EU is to achieve its AI ambitions," the bloc's spending watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the commission defended the bloc's record and said it was investing more than one billion euros (US$1.1 billion) annually in AI research projects under different schemes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US energy giant ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday it will acquire competitor Marathon Oil in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion, including US$5.4 billion in debt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deal, the latest in a series of major acquisitions in the US oil sector, will enable ConocoPhillips to strengthen its position in shale oil and gas-rich regions such as the Bakken Basin in the northern United States and the Permian Basin in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acquisition "further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading US unconventional position," ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer Ryan Lance said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the company sees "significant synergy potential" in the merger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marathon Oil chief Lee Tillman said it was a "proud moment to look back on what we achieved," and that ConocoPhillips was "the right home to build on that legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, gives Marathon Oil shareholders 0.255 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each share of Marathon Oil common stock. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Geneva-based International Labour Organization expects unemployment to stay at 4.9 percent in 2025, but warned that "inequalities in labour markets persist". File photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755273_1_20240530002708.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global unemployment is set to fall slightly this year, a United Nations agency said on Wednesday, reversing its previous prediction of a rise while warning of "slow progress" on tackling inequalities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Labour Organization (ILO) expects a global unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in 2024, after originally forecasting unemployment would rise to 5.2 percent this year from 5 percent in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a report, the Geneva-based UN agency forecasts that the rate will stay at 4.9 percent in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the ILO cautioned that "inequalities in labour markets persist, with women in low-income countries particularly affected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report found that 183 million people meet the definition of unemployed, meaning they are actively looking for work and are immediately available. But the number of people without a job who wanted to work stood at 402 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency also said women were more likely to be unwillingly out of work and disproportionately affected by a lack of opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women in low-income countries were especially hard-hit, with 22.8 percent who wanted a job not in work, compared with 15.3 percent for men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For high-income countries, the rate stood at 9.7 percent for women and 7.3 percent for men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report also warned that these differences were just the "tip of the iceberg" as women were much more likely than men to have left the labour force altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worldwide, the report estimated that 45.6 percent of women of working age were employed in 2024. For men, the figure was 69.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite our efforts to reduce global inequalities, the labour market remains an uneven playing field," ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo is quoted as saying in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To achieve a sustainable recovery whose benefits are shared by all... we must place inclusion and social justice at the core of our policies and institutions," Houngbo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ILO is the oldest specialised UN agency and brings together employers, unions and governments from around the world. (AFP)

    Two giant pandas to head to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, in 2022. Two other giant pandas are heading to Washington's National Zoo later in the year. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755269_1_20240529222502.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will return giant pandas to Washington's National Zoo by the end of the year, US First Lady Jill Biden and officials said on Wednesday in a surprise announcement signalling a new era of panda diplomacy between the two superpowers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We are excited for children near and far to once again enjoy the giant pandas' adorable and joyful adventures at our @NationalZoo," the first lady posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing will send a new pair called Bao Li and Qing Bao under a 10-year breeding and research agreement, the zoo said in a statement, hailing a "historic moment" that demonstrated the benefits of its partnership with Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, DC," said Brandie Smith of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, only a handful of the iconic black and white bears remain in the US, with three having left the national zoo in Washington six months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Xi Jinping said after meeting President Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would be happy to have more bamboo-chewing bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been using so-called "panda diplomacy" since 1972, when the first animals were sent to the United States as a gift, following then-president Richard Nixon's historic visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strained relations between the rival superpowers in recent years have led Beijing to call some of the pandas back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three giant pandas at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington – Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who arrived in 2000, and their three-year-old cub Xiao Qi Ji ("Little Miracle" in English) – flew back on a cargo plane to China in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The currently last remaining pandas in the US, at a zoo in the southern city of Atlanta, are due to return to China later this year, although China announced plans in February to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Egypt on Wednesday signed agreements deepening their cooperation during President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's visit to Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping and his Egyptian counterpart witnessed the signing in a ceremony that coincided with the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China and Egypt discussed bilateral relations and bringing stability to the Middle East in light of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a statement released by the Egyptian presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused a large number of innocent Palestinian civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation in Gaza is extremely severe. China is deeply pained," Xi told el-Sisi, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The top priority task now is an immediate ceasefire, in order to avoid spillover of conflict, impact on regional peace and stability, and so as to prevent a more serious humanitarian crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that China is ready to work with Egypt to continue to assist the people of Gaza "and push for an early, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, along with Qatar and the United States, have been engaged for months in talks aimed at securing a lasting truce between Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreements signed between Beijing and Cairo on Wednesday include collaboration in the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state projects, including the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital east of Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investments between the two countries amounted to around US$14 billion in 2023, compared to US$16.6 billion in 2022, according to the latest data released by Egypt’s statistics agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is hosting el-Sisi and several other Arab leaders in Beijing this week, with talks aimed at deepening consensus between Beijing and the Arab countries. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 National security police on Wednesday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested on Tuesday and linked to seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that a 53-year-old woman arrested on Wednesday is the wife of one of those taken into custody the day before.
  <br/>

  Officers are not ruling out further arrests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Wednesday said it arrested 12 people, including footballers and coaches, for alleged match-fixing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the head coach, a midfielder and a goalkeeper of a football team in the Hong Kong Premier League were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also taken into custody were a coach and five players from two teams in the third-tier Second Division. Three betting agents were arrested as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC did not name the suspects or their clubs, citing an ongoing investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged offences took place over three seasons, beginning with the 2021 campaign, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matthew Chang, a principal investigator with the ICAC, said the coaches allegedly communicated with players with signals during the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They would give some secret signals during the match if they can recruit some players in the same team, like moving their head or using their body language, gestures, to show that at which specific times the involved players have to do something, like to keep going to score or just stop to defend,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said each player could get up to tens of thousands of dollars for each match fixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also believed that some of those arrested placed bets in illegal gambling for gains, with the amount of bets topping HK$1 million in one season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said the suspects have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Football Association of Hong Kong, China said it will fully assist the ICAC in the investigation, stressing that it has "zero tolerance" towards football corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the association said if the allegations are proven true, it will severely punish the clubs, players and coaches involved by revoking their memberships and imposing lifetime suspensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Premier League expressed regret over the incident, adding that it will work with the football association to create a fair and clean football industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said it will not tolerate illegal acts. The bureau said it will urge the local football association to work with ICAC and improve the anti-corruption awareness of football clubs.

 South Africans began voting on Wednesday in the most competitive election since the end of apartheid, with opinion polls suggesting the African National Congress (ANC) would lose its parliamentary majority after 30 years in government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Then led by Nelson Mandela, the ANC swept to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election in 1994 and won a majority in national elections held every five years since then, though its share of the vote has gradually declined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Wednesday's election, voters choose the 400 members of the National Assembly and these MPs will then go on in the coming weeks to choose a president from among their number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Candidates for South Africa's nine provincial assemblies were also on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If it falls short of a 50 percent majority, the ANC could be forced to negotiate a coalition deal with one or more of the smaller parties in order to continue governing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the ANC to do well enough to remain the largest party in parliament,
  <br/>
  meaning its leader, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, was likely to stay in office, unless he faced an internal challenge if the party's performance was worse than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter dissatisfaction over high rates of unemployment and crime, frequent power blackouts and corruption in party ranks lies behind the ANC's gradual fall from grace. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said efforts are underway to respond to a court order on formulating an official framework to recognise same-sex partnerships following a landmark ruling last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Court of Final Appeal ruled last September that the government has a constitutional duty to allow gay couples to register their partnerships, in a case brought by former activist Jimmy Sham who married his male partner in New York in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top court said the government would be given two years to come up with an alternative framework so that same-sex relationships could be provided legal recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a request by lawmaker Regina Ip for an update on the situation, constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang said officials are "actively taking forward the relevant work" and will seek the views of the Legislative Council in due course, once there are concrete suggestions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the matter is complex and involves a wide range of issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now following the court's relevant judgment and timetable, conducting detailed study with the [Department of Justice] and relevant bureaux on the mechanism relating to the legal recognition of same-sex relationship, thresholds of recognition, eligibilities, conditions, how to effectively avoid abuses of the alternative framework, etc, as well as the rights and obligations arisen, including 'core rights' and 'supplementary rights', and formulating implementation," he said.

<img alt="Paul Chan met with representatives from five SAR startups currently exploring opportunities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday told business leaders in San Francisco that the SAR is a “natural launching pad” for them to enter the Asian and China markets, as he promoted collaboration between the China-US bay areas on a five-day trip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a business luncheon, Chan said there were many commonalities between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area, with the two places the global engines of technological innovation and also the birthplaces of tech firm giants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area are a magnet, attracting a lot of talent, that is our competitive advantage, and also this will give us continuous impetus in terms of innovation and technological development,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to point out there’s also a difference between the two places in terms of population and market sizes, as the Californian bay area has a population of about seven million, while the Guangdong bay area population stands at some 87 million, with huge market potential contributing to some 12 percent of the Chinese economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So if you want to launch your products or services in Asia, in China, Hong Kong is naturally your launching pad, because from here you can springboard to other parts of the mainland and Asia,” he told delegates, noting the SAR’s financial markets are much bigger in breadth and depth compared with Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between InvestHK and San Francisco’s Bay Area Council to promote cooperation especially in the green economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the finance minister also met with representatives of five Hong Kong startups currently exploring expansion in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five SAR startups specialise in areas including biodegradable materials, new construction materials, online marketing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and the entrepreneurs are exploring the market there whilst undertaking training programmes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also welcomed a plan by a Silicon Valley startup accelerator company to set up a technological innovation centre in the SAR.

    Jørn Andersen resigns as SAR head coach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong football head coach Jørn Andersen announced on Wednesday that he has resigned with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andersen said he had received an offer "he couldn't refuse", without disclosing which club it came from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that the local football association "had made every effort to retain" him, offering him a new three-year contract being as his original deal was due to expire next summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After much careful consideration, I have made a difficult decision and decide to take a new challenge, and step down as coach of the Hong Kong, China representative team," Andersen said at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have recently received an invitation from a club outside that presents an opportunity that I simply cannot refuse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian thanked the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, as well as the SAR government, his staff, players and the fans for their support throughout "a fantastic journey" in the past two and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thank all the players who train with me, play with me. And at last, I thank all the great Hong Kong fans who support us everywhere, wherever we were playing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, the coach, 61, had spoken to the press about the association not offering him a new contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association, for its part, said Andersen informed them of his intention to leave on Monday, and officially tabled his resignation on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant coach Wolfgang Luisser has been named interim head coach, with Szeto Man-chun joining the coaching staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andersen took up the head coach role in late 2021. He is considered to have successfully changed the team's culture by playing with a high pressing, attacking style that was relatively rare in the SAR squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, he led the team to its first Asian Cup berth since 1968, with the squad putting up inspiring battles despite defeats against Asian heavyweights Iran and the United Arab Emirates, as well as a surprising Palestinian team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team Hong Kong, China also made history at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year, when Andersen took the under-23 squad to advance to the semi-final stage for the first time ever.

    Record temperatures scorch India's capital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures in India's capital soared to a record-high 49.9 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, the government's weather bureau said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The India Meteorological Department, which reported "severe heat-wave conditions", recorded the temperatures at two New Delhi suburb stations at Narela and Mungeshpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters predict similar temperatures on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May 2022, parts of New Delhi hit 49.2 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India is no stranger to searing summer temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But scientists have found climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi authorities also warned of the risk of water shortages as the capital swelters in an intense heatwave -- cutting supplies to some areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Water Minister Atishi Marlena called for "collective responsibility" to stop wasteful water use, the Times of India newspaper reported Wednesday. (AFP)

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755174_1_20240529122248.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's attorney general's office on Wednesday said former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra would be prosecuted for insulting the monarchy over comments he made almost a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prayuth Pecharakun, spokesman for the attorney general, said Thaksin would be summoned to court on June 18 to answer charges under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, 74, is a two-time premier who was ousted in a 2006 coup and then lived in self exile for 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned to Thailand last year as his Pheu Thai party took power at the head of a coalition government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attorney general has decided to indict Thaksin for insulting the monarchy," Prayuth told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attorney general cannot bring him to court today, as his (Thaksin's) lawyer said he has Covid."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand has some of the world's strictest royal defamation laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each charge bringing a potential 15-year prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin's lawyer, Winyat Chatmontree, said he would fight the charges. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s lived-in home prices rose for the second straight month in April, increasing by 0.3 percent from March, with all home sizes seeing gains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Wednesday showed that the latest official price index of second-hand units stood at 308.7 last month, compared with 305.7 in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase was broad-based, as all small, medium, and large sized units saw gains of about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came after the index logged its first increase in 11 months in March, as buyers returned to the market after Financial Secretary Paul Chan scrapped all property cooling measures in his Budget on February 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, taking the first four months in total, home prices still fell 0.84 percent, and the latest index level was still about 13 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rental prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent on a monthly basis, also a second straight increase, but still 4.6 percent lower from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s rents rose 0.5 percent in the first four months of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local star footballer Philip Chan won the Hong Kong Footballer of the Year award on Tuesday, the first player from the SAR to do so since goalkeeper Edmond Yapp in 2016.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tai Po midfielder scooped three further trophies at the Top Football Awards Ceremony, including Fan's Favourite, with over 4,500 votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He took home a total of HK$60,000 in prize money by also winning the award for the best player from the local top-flight representing the SAR in international competition, as well as being named one of the midfielders in the season's Best XI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Po finished second in the league this season, with Chan often scoring last-minute winners for the team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder, 31, also scored the 1,000th goal in the history of the Asian Cup in January while playing for the SAR team in Qatar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Eastern swept a number of awards, with Roberto Losada winning Coach of the Year, striker Noah Baffoe Player's Favourite, and midfielders Jesse Yu and Ma Hei-wai named Young Players of the Year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Novak Djokovic shrugged off his recent troubles to sweep to his 93rd career win at the French Open on Tuesday, extending his run of first round Roland Garros victories to a perfect 20.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, chasing a fourth title in Paris and record 25th Grand Slam triumph, came through against 142nd-ranked French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-4, 7-6 [7/3], 6-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old, who saw career-long rival and 14-time champion Rafael Nadal exit the tournament on Monday, had arrived under a cloud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time since 2018, he is without a title and has yet to reach a final this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a victory in three sets, that's what matters at this moment. I felt better compared to the last few weeks. I was focused. I encouraged myself, I am satisfied with my state of mind," said Djokovic
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, who has advanced to the French Open quarter-finals or better every year since 2010, will face Spain's 63rd-ranked Roberto Carballes Baena for a place in the last 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka, a semi-finalist in 2023, over-powered Russian teenager Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2 in just 68 minutes under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier as heavy rain caused a five-hour delay to action around the grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying to do well on clay, it is tough conditions here but I enjoy playing here and I'm just trying to bring my best tennis every time -- whatever the surface," said Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was better luck for Andreeva's younger sister Mirra, who went to the fourth round as a 16-year-old in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept past Emina Bektas of the United States in straights sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time runner-up Casper Ruud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to Roland Garros, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Baptist University is hosting a conference called FoodMed, which will look at ways of better utilising the heritage of Chinese medicine. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755141_1_20240529094258.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Baptist University academic says he hopes a framework can be established on promoting "food as medicine" in the primary healthcare system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The university is hosting a two-day conference called FoodMed. Terence Lau, the university's Interim Chief Innovation Officer and chair of the conference, said Chinese medicine used many herbal components that people also consumed as food, such as ginseng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, he was asked about the relationship to medicine, especially as there had previously been controversies in Hong Kong over naturopathic - or so-called holistic - treatments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can enhance primary health by alleviating a lot of unhealthy conditions and food can also provide a lot of benefits for chronic diseases," he said. "We are not trying to replace the traditional, or western, medicine doctors. But I think it's another approach to enhance people's health."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lau also called for the greater use of technology in the field, especially when it came to data collection. He said Chinese medicine had a lot of heritage and the conference would be looking at better ways to utilise this.

    Trump lawyers wrap up defence in hush money case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Trump lawyers wrap up defence in hush money case" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755118_1_20240529053655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defence lawyers in Donald Trump's hush money trial made their final pitch to the jury on Tuesday, insisting the first ever criminal prosecution of a former US president was based on "lies."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Less than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate -- for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, when her account of a 2006 sexual encounter could have doomed his 2016 presidential campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very dangerous day for America," Trump told reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him. "We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Trump is innocent," his defense attorney Todd Blanche told the jury at the start of what he said would be about two-and-a-half hours of closing arguments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The consequences of the lack of proof you have heard over the last five weeks is simple -- it's a not guilty verdict," Blanche said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attacked Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, as a liar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He told you a number of things on that witness stand that were lies, pure and simple," Blanche said. "You cannot convict president Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump was "busy running the country" when the reimbursements were made to Cohen," he said, and he did not inspect all the invoices that came across his desk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was no intent to defraud and beyond that there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by president Trump," Blanche said. "He did not commit any crimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump had a grim expression as his lawyer spoke, his head tilted as he studied the jurors. He gave a thumbs-up as he left the courtroom during a break but did not address reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a "clown" and "grubby real estate developer" intent on destroying the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump chose not to testify in his defence -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq crossed 17,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday, boosted by gains in Nvidia, while the S&P 500 closed slightly higher and the Dow slightly lower as Treasury yields rose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nvidia shares boosted shares of other chip stocks as traders returned from a holiday-extended weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks lost ground in the afternoon as US Treasury yields climbed to multi-week highs after weak debt auctions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.03 percent to 5,306, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 percent to 17,019. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 percent to 38,852.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors awaited US inflation data this week that could sway expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report for April is due later this week. The Fed's preferred inflation barometer is expected to hold steady on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S&P 500 technology led gains among sectors, while healthcare was the biggest decliner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It’s all about technology and the winners continue to be the winners, specifically Nvidia," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street has been hitting records recently as investors bet the US central bank could kick off interest-rate cuts this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations for the timing of rate cuts have see-sawed, with policymakers wary as data still reflects sticky inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The retail sector will also be in focus this week, with several retailers due to report results.
  <br/>

    Putin warns west of 'serious consequences'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the west not to let Ukraine use their munitions against targets within Russia. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755115_1_20240529005630.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that there would be "serious consequences" if Western countries allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets in Russia, as sought by Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin's warning came in response to calls within some Nato members as well as the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg to allow Ukraine to use their arms to step up attacks on Russian soil, in an attempt to end more than two years of fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences," Putin said during a visit to Uzbekistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Europe, especially in small countries, they should be aware of what they are playing with," he said, noting that many European countries had "small territory" and a "dense population".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And this factor, which they should keep in mind before they talk about striking deep into Russian territory, is a serious thing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that even if Ukraine's forces carried out the strikes, responsibility for them would lie with Western suppliers of the weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They want a global conflict," he said. Western countries have long been wary of being deemed a belligerent in the Ukraine conflict as they provide support to Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also said that while he believed Western military instructors were already in Ukraine operating undercover as mercenaries, any move by countries to send them officially would be another "escalation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's top commander announced Monday that talks were being held with France on sending military instructors to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is another step towards a serious conflict in Europe, towards a global conflict," Putin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are specialists there under the guise of mercenaries," he said, adding that "this was nothing new".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they would be "defeated" by the Russian army, as "we will do what we think is necessary regardless of who is on the territory of Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Brussels that European countries were split on sending military instructors to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Countries including Germany oppose taking a step they fear could potentially drag them closer to direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU countries have trained 50,000 Ukrainian troops outside the war-torn country under a bloc-wide mission set up in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Western allies to provide longer-range missiles and other material for striking deeper into Russia in a bid to cripple its military and industrial capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the war now in its third year, Ukraine is also pleading for more weapons for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, notably seeking help to address its lack of air defence systems. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis issued an extraordinary apology on Tuesday over his reported use of a gay slur in a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms and he extends his apologies to those who felt offended by the use of a term, reported by others," the Vatican said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a meeting with more than 250 bishops last week, the 87-year-old pontiff was said to have used an offensive term while expressing his opposition to openly homosexual men joining training colleges for priests, even if they committed to celibacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to two Italian newspapers, Francis said there was already too much "frociaggine" in seminaries, using an offensive Roman term which translates as "faggotry".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reports made headlines around the world and drew dismay from both LGTBQ groups and practising Catholics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some commentators suggested the Argentine pope did not know what he was saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Vatican statement did not confirm that he used the word but referenced newspaper articles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As he had the opportunity to state on several occasions: 'In the Church there is room for everyone, everyone! Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us'," the statement said. (AFP)

    OpenAI unveils safety and security group

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some critics have raised safety concerns over OpenAI's chatbots as they become increasingly powerful. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755112_1_20240529002543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI has formed a Safety and Security Committee that will be led by board members, including CEO Sam Altman, as it begins training its next artificial intelligence model, the AI startup said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Directors Bret Taylor, Adam D'Angelo and Nicole Seligman will also lead the committee, OpenAI said on a company blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft-backed OpenAI's chatbots with generative AI capabilities, such as engaging in human-like conversations and creating images based on text prompts, have stirred safety concerns as AI models become powerful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new committee will be responsible for making recommendations to the board on safety and security decisions for OpenAI's projects and operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A new safety committee signifies OpenAI completing a move to becoming a commercial entity, from a more undefined non-profit-like entity," said D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That should help streamline product development while maintaining accountability."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, who were leaders of OpenAI's Superalignment team, which ensured AI stays aligned to the intended objectives, left the firm earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OpenAI had disbanded the Superalignment team, earlier in May, less than a year after the company created it, with some team members being reassigned to other groups, CNBC reported days after the high-profile departures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's first task will be to evaluate and further develop OpenAI’s existing safety practices over the next 90 days, following which it will share recommendations with the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the board's review, OpenAI will publicly share an update on adopted recommendations, the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others on the committee include newly appointed Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki and Matt Knight, head of security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company will also consult other experts, including Rob Joyce, a former US National Security Agency cybersecurity director and John Carlin, a former Department of Justice official.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world experienced an average of 26 more days of extreme heat over the last 12 months that would probably not have occurred without climate change, a report said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Heat is the leading cause of climate-related death and the report further points to the role of global warming in increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For this study, scientists used the years 1991 to 2020 to determine what temperatures counted as within the top 10 percent for each country over that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next, they looked at the 12 months to May 15, 2024, to establish how many days over that period experienced temperatures within -- or beyond -- the previous range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, using peer-reviewed methods, they examined the influence of climate change on each of these excessively hot days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They concluded that "human-caused climate change added -- on average, across all places in the world -- 26 more days of extreme heat than there would have been without it".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report was published by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the World Weather Attribution scientific network and the non-profit research organisation Climate Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2023 was the hottest year on record, according to the European Union's climate monitor, Copernicus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already this year, extreme heatwaves have afflicted swathes of the globe from Mexico to Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report said that in the last 12 months some 6.3 billion people -- roughly 80 percent of the global population -- experienced at least 31 days of what is classed as extreme heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, 76 extreme heatwaves were registered in 90 different countries on every continent except Antarctica.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five of the most affected nations were in Latin America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report said that without the influence of climate change, Suriname would have recorded an estimated 24 extreme heat days instead of 182; Ecuador 10 not 180; Guyana 33 not 174, El Salvador 15 not 163; and Panama 12 not 149.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Extreme heat) is known to have killed tens of thousands of people over the last 12 months but the real number is likely in the hundreds of thousands or even millions," the Red Cross said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Flooding and hurricanes may capture the headlines but the impacts of extreme heat are equally deadly," said Jagan Chapagain, secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for efforts to promote high-quality and sufficient employment, and to further boost employment through development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks on Monday while presiding over a Politburo group study session, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We should] insist that employment of young people including college graduates is a top priority," Xi told the session. China is expected to see over 11.7 million college graduates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said measures should be taken to promote the employment of migrant workers, stabilise the number and income of people who were lifted out of poverty, and provide more help to groups that find it difficult to secure employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for efforts to deepen the reform of employment systems and mechanisms, and protect the rights and interests of workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China created 4.36 million new urban jobs in the first four months, human resources ministry data showed, 36 percent of its annual job creation target. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority on Tuesday said a four-year-old girl suffered a cardiac arrest after receiving stitches in Yan Chai Hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the medical staff resuscitated her and that she regained a heartbeat 18 minutes later, but remains in a coma and in critical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was sent to Yan Chai Hospital’s accident and emergency department after sustaining a head injury in a fall on Saturday night. The child had a slight fever and medical staff put stitches into a two-centimetre gash in her head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital's chief executive, Ian Cheung, said this incident was "very rare", adding the staff had followed procedures when giving her three stitches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very short process... She cried during the first stitch, but she quieted down during the second and the third stitches," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We checked her after completing the process because it's over so quickly, and we found out she didn't have a pulse. So we must find experts to give us advice on why this happened."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The girl was then transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong Nai-chung, chief of service for paediatrics in both Princess Margaret and Yan Chai hospitals, said she suffered from ischemic encephalopathy, which meant her brain was injured because blood supply decreased when her heart stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, she is on a ventilator, given heart medication and drugs to control seizures and swelling in the brain. These are also coupled with antibiotics and nutrient injections. Our team will monitor her situation closely and provide the most appropriate treatment for her," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority said it is upset by the incident, and is providing assistance to the girl's family.

    Six arrested over 'seditious posts'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police say the case relates to seditious posts published on social media. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755055_1_20240528184935.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were arrested on Tuesday under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, with police saying the group is suspected of "offences in connection with seditious intention".
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security police accused a woman who was on remand of taking advantage of "a forthcoming sensitive date" and publishing seditious posts on social media anonymously, with the help of five others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, was one of those arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 37 and 65, were arrested by national security police at various locations in the city, including the Tai Lam Centre for Women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media posts since April were allegedly aimed at inciting public hatred of the central government, the SAR administration and the judiciary, and were allegedly designed to encourage people to organise or take part in illegal activities, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electronic devices suspected of having been used to publish posts with seditious intention were among items seized during the operation, the force added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These are the first arrests made under Hong Kong's homegrown national security legislation that came into effect in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesperson noted that people found guilty of committing offences in connection with seditious intention face a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also warned that people who try to endanger national security should not think they can avoid police investigation by making anonymous comments online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The allegations (against) this group of people are using a Facebook page on social media to advocate hatred against our central government, the Hong Kong government and also our judiciary,” Tang told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They're relating to a forthcoming sensitive date. But I would like to reiterate that... the main crime is not about the subject. It's about their utilising the subject during which they incited hatred against the central government and our Hong Kong government and the judiciary. This incitement of hatred is the cause of the crime.”

    Fencing four hope to bring HK good results

<div class="itemFullText">
 The four fencers representing the SAR in the Olympics on Tuesday said they hope to use the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait next month as final preparation for Paris in July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Star fencer Vivian Kong has won several large events, including the Fujairah Women's Epee World Cup 2024 and the Barcelona Women's Epee World Cup 2024, but has yet to win an Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she still has to give it her all, even though this will be her third Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's like psychologically and mentally [where] I need to be calm and that's like usually the hardest part when we compete especially in foreign competitions. Technically, it's all my coach [Octavian Zidaru]. He knows every action we work on," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's always like this one higher, this one lower, this one point more accurately, so there's always something wrong with my actions, so I have to work hard to make him happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Olympic gold-medallist Edgar Cheung said he doesn't want to let the pressure to win another medal affect his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the competition in Kuwait will give him another practice opportunity before the Games, adding that it's vital to perform to the best of his ability and enjoy the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, there are challenges but for me, it is like preparing well for myself, and give all my best, and afterwards, we will see what happens. I think me and Vivian had quite a good experience about the Olympics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the two of the rest, one is my ex-roommate so we are friends. We have been talking about the Olympics, how it is and I just told them to enjoy and to have fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Epee fencer Cedric Ho said he is excited to have booked his place in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though I'm really excited, I do want to bring that energy down a little and enter the Olympics with a calm mindset," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be going to the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait at the end of June, and those results will determine our rankings in the Olympics. I will use that competition as a prep for the Games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for Daphne Chan, she said she doesn't have specific expectations from the Games, and is just looking forward to learning from her teammates and staying focused for Paris.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers will soon be able to watch a series of special RTHK Olympics-related programmes in Putonghua, Cantonese and English, including some produced on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sign language and audio description services will also be available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes after RTHK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Guangdong Radio and Television on Monday, and another with Beijing Radio and Television Station (BRTV) on Tuesday, to jointly deliver news related to the Paris Olympics and Paralympics 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China Media Group is also a cooperation partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the special shows will be produced locally, featuring issues related to Environmental, social, and governance, to echo the Paris Games’ goal of being the greenest Games ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be a raft of programmes produced by the Guangdong and Beijing TV stations, with content ranging from local culture, behind-the-scenes stories of the Winter Olympics 2022, as well as individual athletes’ preparations for this summer's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a signing ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the programmes will promote a sports culture in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This allows all Hongkongers to cheer for athletes from the national team and Team Hong Kong, while uniting all sectors of the society and encouraging residents to do more exercise,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, we hope that the broadcast of the Paris Olympics and the Paralympics Games 2024 will further spur local catering and retail activities, boosting the local economy by creating a ‘multiplier effect’,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li Xiulei, deputy chief editor of BRTV, said the cooperation between Hong Kong and Beijing marks the beginning of a deepening of cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope Hong Kong viewers and listeners could learn about Beijing’s profound culture via the programmes by BRTV,” she said, adding that she hopes the two cities will further strengthen collaboration to provide more diversified programmes for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong government has purchased broadcasting rights for this year's Olympics, allowing RTHK, TVB, Hoy TV and ViuTV to show the Games on their free-to-air channels.

    Increase penalties over illicit cigarettes: customs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Customs has recorded over 7,000 cases related to illicit cigarette activities in the first five months. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755065_1_20240528175043.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Tuesday proposed increasing the penalties for crimes involving illicit cigarettes, after they detected a 50 percent rise in cases this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Customs recorded over 7,000 cases in the first five months, which was a 54 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An assistant customs commissioner, Lai Chi-wing, said most illicit cigarettes were shipped into Hong Kong before the pandemic, but more travellers had been bringing in illicit cigarettes into the city after the border reopened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The total number of incoming passengers bringing in dutiable cigarettes was over 5,000 [from February to May], so this is not a small figure. So we try to target these incoming passengers bringing in small amount of cigarettes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials recommended increasing the maximum imprisonment term from two to seven years, and to double the maximum fine to HK$2 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also proposed including the offence of illicit cigarettes under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance, as cases may involve syndicates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs proposed that cigarettes being sold lower than the tax amount should be presumed as duty-not-paid goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out there were packs of cheap white cigarettes being sold at HK$40 in the market, which was even lower than the required tax of HK$66 for a packet of 20 cigarettes.

 Lawmakers on Tuesday called on authorities to speed up its long-standing plan to turn south Lantau into a tourist spot, with some urging the government to make it a high-end vacation resort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials told a Legco meeting they were collecting the public's views over the next two months on building a pier and accommodation facilities in Cheung Sha, as well as setting up a water sports centre at Hong Kong’s longest beach there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the proposed South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor plan, an uphill chairlift would also be built in Cheung Sha, and the neighbouring areas of Shek Pik, Shui Hau and Pui O would get walkways around a reservoir, along the shore of a sand flat, or on treetops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But legislators like Andrew Lam said the government had earlier made such plans in its blueprint to develop Lantau back in 2017, and had asked authorities to act on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undersecretary for Development David Lam said the government would try to build more parking spaces, family playgrounds and a visitor’s centre in the area in a year or two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The undersecretary said preliminary assessments on the environment and infrastructure had shown the proposals would not have any adverse impact on south Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is estimated the corridor would attract 4,000 to 6,000 more visitors a day during holidays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have to access the reception capacity of Lantau as a whole because it wouldn't be ideal if too many visitors are going to the area and destroy the local characteristics. So maybe we'll implement an online booking system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said authorities could transform south Lantau into an upscale vacation destination featuring high-end resort hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said authorities were liaising with developers and had received some positive response.
