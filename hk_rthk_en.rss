<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarisation grows over Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Voting opened at 7am in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But turnout in the first round of voting last week dropped nearly four points to 66 percent from the last election in 2019, with speculation in Indian media that higher-than-average temperatures were to blame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second round of the poll -- conducted in phases to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country -- includes districts that have this week seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outcome of Friday’s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 970 million voters will elect 543 members from a total 28 states to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election that runs until June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes will be counted on June 4. (Agencies)

    Home prices rebound after 10-month fall

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750650_1_L_20240426120605.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Friday said they arrested a man on suspicion of possessing firearms without a licence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers found 18 guns, 11 knives, and four daggers at a self-storage facility in Sha Tin, and arrested the 67-year-old suspect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Superintendent Cheung Ting-fung said the man had previously held licences for various types of guns, but these were revoked in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said it is suspected that all the firearms found at the storage facility this week were obtained illegally from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the case was not related to the social unrest in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, we do not have any evidence showing that the arrested person is connected to any previous riot or violent cases. We tend to believe that this arrested person is just a firearms fanatic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case will be heard at the Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts on Friday afternoon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai was entering a new phase as the CE met with the city's mayor for a major conference on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the sixth plenary session of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Co-operation Conference, Lee said the two cities would sign 20 cooperation documents and reach consensus on 65 projects in areas such as innovation technology, industrial development, digital economy and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the first meeting in 2003, the two cities have been engaging in more frequent exchanges... Hong Kong has become one of the major export markets and also the largest source of foreign investment into Shanghai," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said these exchanges created opportunities and built a win-win situation for the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We sincerely hope that the two cities can take the opportunity of signing a new round of cooperation documents to integrate our development strategies comprehensively, create highlights for our cooperation and together push Hong Kong-Shanghai cooperation to a new phase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong Yin Zonghua, Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan, were among the other leaders and officials at the meeting.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joel Embiid shoots past New York Knicks forward Precious Achiuwa. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750641_1_L_20240426110554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid scored 50 points to power the 76ers to a vital 125-114 victory over the New York Knicks on Thursday, the Sixers clawing back a game in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 76ers had dropped the first two games of their best-of-seven first-round series at Madison Square Garden, Embiid defiantly insisting they were the "better team" and would right the ship at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made sure they did, and the Orlando Magic also bounced back in a big way after going 0-2 down against the Cavaliers in Cleveland, routing the Cavs 121-83 to trim their series deficit to one game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid posted a career playoff high, connecting on 13 of 19 shots including five of seven from three-point range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made seven of eight attempts on the way to 18 points in the third quarter, when the Sixers erased a three-point halftime deficit and pushed their lead to 13 going into the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid added eight rebounds, four assists and a blocked shot and was assessed a flagrant foul for pulling Mitchell Robinson to the court by the ankle in the first quarter – moments after Embiid had been sent crashing by Knicks forward OG Anunoby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 13 assists. Josh Hart scored 20 points but game two hero Donte DiVincenzo had just five and the 76ers will have a chance to level the series on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Orlando, Paolo Banchero scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds as the Magic clawed back to 2-1 after dropping the first two games of the Eastern Conference series in Cleveland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-point win marked the third-largest margin of victory in a playoff game in Magic history – and their first home playoff win since a 2011 first-round win over Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just wanted to come out and be aggressive," Banchero said. "Going down 3-0 is a lot different than being down 2-1. So [I] knew we had to get this game – and we've got to do it again on Saturday." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks across a range of complex issues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat is due to spend several hours with Wang across closed-door meetings at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and a working lunch as the two sides try to maintain progress in ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the pair settled into their opening session, Wang told Blinken that the "great ship" of the China-US relationship had stabilised, "but negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. China’s legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken replied that "active diplomacy" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden when they met in San Francisco in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy," Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that "we’re as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China's support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese officials and state media have cast doubt over the extent of possible progress on several fronts, with a China Daily editorial saying that both sides "have been largely talking past each other".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the US; and the US side should not turn it into one," it said. (Reuters)

 Heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong on Friday with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning just after 8.30 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber signal means that heavy rain, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour, has fallen and is likely to continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned of flooding in some low-lying and poorly-drained areas, while the Labour Department told construction workers and contractors to pay attention to electrical safety in the workplace.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chicago Bears drafted quarterback Caleb Williams out of the University of Southern California with the number one overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five quarterbacks went in the first 10 picks of the draft with no defensive players selected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three of the top draft picks were used to select quarterbacks, with The Washington Commanders choosing Jayden Daniels from Louisiana State University and the New England Patriots opting for North Carolina signal-caller Drake Maye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bears' choice of Williams was widely expected, with the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner seen as the answer to the franchise's long-running problem at the position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the Bears traded their quarterback Justin Fields, a first round pick in 2021, to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams began his college career at Oklahoma before switching to USC and in 37 games, with 33 starts, he threw for 9,782 yards and 93 touchdown passes with an additional 27 rushing touchdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bears provided Williams with a wide-receiver with the ninth pick opting for Washington's Rome Odunze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels played a total of 55 games in college football, beginning with Arizona State before joining LSU and in 55 games he threw for 12,750 yards and 89 touchdowns and added 3,307 rushing yards and 34 rushing touchdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Patriots were taking part in the draft without Bill Belichick as their head coach for the first time since 1999 and they will hope Maye can end their search for a quarterback to finally replace Tom Brady.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a quarterback heavy top of the draft, the Atlanta Falcons surprisingly opted for Michael Penix Jr out of Washington with the eighth pick despite recently signing a quarterback in Kirk Cousins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penix is a highly-rated quarterback but was expected to have fallen down the draft due to concerns over a series of injuries he has suffered including two anterior cruciate ligament knee injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To replace Cousins, the Minnesota Vikings moved up a place in the draft to take Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy with the 10th pick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been speculation that the New York Giants might make a move for a quarterback with their sixth pick but they opted for a wide receiver in Malik Nabers from LSU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Los Angeles Chargers took an offensive tackle in Joe Alt out of Notre Dame and the Tennessee Titans also took a player in that role, drafting Alabama's JC Latham. (AFP)

 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Thursday inspected the test-firing of 240 mm multiple-launch rockets manufactured by a newly-established defence industry unit, the North's KCNA news agency reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report did not give further details of the unit that produced the artillery. North Korea is believed to be ramping up production of artillery amid allegations by the United States and South Korea that it is supplying Russia with weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both countries deny the allegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test firing showed the rockets met the required standards for flight characteristics and accuracy, KCNA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim said the 240 mm multiple launch rocket system, which incorporates new technology, will "bring about a strategic change in strengthening our military's artillery capabilities," according to KCNA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate report, KCNA said Kim visited the Kim Il Sung Military University, named after his grandfather and state founder, to mark the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary army, the precursor to the country's military. (Reuters)

    Trial and error needed for plastic alternatives: CEO

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of one of the companies, invited by the government to meet the media and introduce their alternatives to plastic disposable tableware, says a period of trial and error is still needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes when it came to heat, strength and storage and it was the same for their environmentally-friendly alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a point I would like to share. We all know humans have been using plastics for the last 30 years, 40 years - we have all experience," he said. "Different plastics are made for different purposes. For example, a plastic container for sandwiches is not the same formulation as a plastic container for oil or soup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said that with the introduction of new plant-fibre containers and cutlery, consumers and users needed to focus on what alternative products met their needs rather than just focusing on price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Department put on the media event as it launched the Green Tableware Platform to help people and businesses find alternatives to plastic utensils. The online platform provides a list of suppliers for the environmentally-friendly products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

    Nadal begins Madrid farewell with teen Blanch victory

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal breezed to a straight sets victory over 16-year-old Darwin Blanch to reach the Madrid Open second round on Thursday as he began his farewell appearance in the Spanish capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old said this week he was not fully fit but demolished his American opponent 6-1, 6-0 in one hour and three minutes as he continues his comeback from injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, is expecting 2024 to be his final season in tennis and this his last appearance at the Madrid Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his first competitive appearance since January at the Barcelona Open last week, where he was defeated in the second round by Alex de Minaur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian will be Nadal's second round opponent in Madrid too as the Spaniard tries to find form and fitness ahead of Rome and then the French Open, where he is the record 14-time winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am hoping to do as well as possible and I hope to be competitive against De Minaur," said Nadal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me it has always been a pleasure to play in front of you all... the support I've received here since the first time I played is hard to compare to anywhere else, so I can only say thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal broke in the second game against the overpowered and initially overawed American, ranked 1,028th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanch got on the board in the fourth game but Nadal broke again in the sixth after the youngster drove a forehand into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanch saved two break points at the start of the second set but Nadal converted the third to take further control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The merciless tennis great broke again after an entertaining rally for a 3-0 lead and once more when Blanch went long to make it 5-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal served it out, triumphing on his second match point with a powerful serve that Blanch could not control. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord's Arne Slot wants to succeed Juergen Klopp as Liverpool manager, the Dutchman said on Thursday, and he expects his club and the Premier League side to reach an agreement soon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dutch media reported on Wednesday that Liverpool had opened negotiations with the Eredivisie champions for the services of the 45-year-old Slot who is under contract with the Rotterdam club until 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing I can say about it is that the clubs are in negotiations. Then you sit in the waiting room and wait for what will come out," Slot said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It seems clear to me that I would like to go to Liverpool. Now I'm waiting to see whether the clubs reach an agreement. I'm very confident in that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The clubs have to do their job. It will undoubtedly become clear in the coming days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot was heavily linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur last year, but opted to stay at Feyenoord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been widely praised for his innovative, attacking football with Feyenoord, guiding them to the league title in 2022-23 and the KNVB Cup crown on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first season at Feyenoord, Slot led the Rotterdam club to the final of the inaugural Europa Conference League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp announced in January that he would stand down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season after a highly successful nine-year spell at the club in which they won the Champions League, Premier League, Club World Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and Super Cup. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Phil Foden celebrates scoring his first and City's second goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750604_1_L_20240426064210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Foden struck twice as Manchester City stepped up their bid for a fourth Premier League crown in a row with a ruthless 4-0 victory at Brighton & Hove Albion on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after Liverpool's title challenge suffered a huge blow with a 2-0 defeat at Everton, City kept up the pressure on leaders Arsenal with a dominant display that left them one point behind the London club with a game in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne's superb diving header put City, missing top scorer Erling Haaland due to injury, ahead in the 17th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't happen too much, does it? I think the only way I could reach it was jumping to the ball, and it goes in like a little lob, but it's obviously not something I'm really good at," De Bruyne said after netting his first headed goal in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden scored his first with a deflected free kick and Brighton defensive errors allowed Bernardo Silva to win the ball and set up the England midfielder to sweep a shot into the bottom corner before halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden, whose hat-trick led City to a 4-1 win over Aston Villa three weeks ago, became only the third player to score 50 top-flight goals under manager Pep Guardiola aged 23 or younger, after Lionel Messi and Haaland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez completed the rout midway through the second half and Brighton, who remained 11th in the table, never looked capable of launching a fightback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester City are unbeaten in 30 games in all competitions with 24 wins and six draws, making them the third English top-flight side to reach that landmark after Nottingham Forest [40 in 1978] and Manchester United [34 in 1993-94 and 33 in 1998-99].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their last loss excluding penalty shootouts was against Aston Villa in early December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brighton's best chance came when City keeper Ederson gifted them a late opportunity when he raced out of his box, only to fire the ball straight at Odeluga Offiah who failed to take advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "City are one of the best teams in the world and today they played very well," Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Thursday condemned a vote by the European Parliament critical of Hong Kong’s national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said it “strongly opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for making baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smearing the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said that the SAR had a constitutional duty to safeguard national security, adding that all sovereign states had an inherent right to safeguard their security in accordance with international law and the UN charter. He noted that many other countries had also enacted national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the Parliament has demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards,” the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman noted that both the NSL and the Ordinance clearly specify that rights and freedoms under the Basic Law and international covenants are to be protected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The European Parliament neglected the relevant provisions and lashed out wantonly, fully exposing its malicious intentions," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must once again emphasise that the Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against external forces that endanger our national security, acting like a sturdier door and a more effective door lock to defend our home,” the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to stop smearing and interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China and ensure that their remarks concerning the NSL and the Ordinance are fair and just, and stop making scaremongering remarks.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)

    Interim govt steps in to tackle Haiti crisis

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned on Thursday and a transitional council took power with the aim of returning stability to a country where gang violence has caused chaos and misery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry's former finance minister, Michel Patrick Boisvert, will be interim prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic, this day in effect opens a view to a solution... to the multidimensional crises the country faces," Boisvert said after the formal swearing-in of the nine-person transitional council on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top police and military officials and members of the transitional council stood behind Boisvert during the ceremony, hosted at the prime minister's office known as Villa d'Accueil, which was surrounded by military and a security detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry announced last month he would resign once the council was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left Haiti in February to seek international help for police in their battles with armed and powerful gangs. But he was left stranded outside the country as the gangs threatened to completely take over the capital. Struggling to return, Henry announced his intended resignation. Boisvert had served as acting prime minister in Henry's absence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transitional government's mandate runs until February 2026, by when there are slated to be elections, and cannot be renewed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the path to getting to elections was long, and there were already tensions within the council as different factions jostled for power, said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the installation, there is still a long and rocky road ahead for the council to be able to forge a government," Da Rin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The naming of the council is also seen as key step towards the deployment of a multinational security mission. Kenya had offered to head that mission but then put it on pause as the security situation deteriorated, saying it would re-evaluate once a new government was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the multinational force to happen quickly to help tackle the "dire" situation, his spokesperson said on Thursday. (Reuters)

    Climate change wipes 10pc off wine production

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wine producers say climate change is harming grape harvests. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750585_1_L_20240426023611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World wine production dropped 10 percent last year, the biggest fall in more than six decades, because of "extreme" climate changes, the body that monitors the trade said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Extreme environmental conditions" including droughts, fires and other problems with climate were mostly to blame for the drastic fall, said the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) that covers nearly 50 wine producing countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia and Italy suffered the worst, with 26 and 23 percent drops. Spain lost more than a fifth of its production. Harvests in Chile and South Africa were down by more than 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The OIV said the global grape harvest was the worst since 1961, and worse even than its early estimates in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In further bad news for winemakers, customers drank three per cent less wine in 2023, the French-based intergovernmental body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director John Barker highlighted "drought, extreme heat and fires, as well as heavy rain causing flooding and fungal diseases across major northern and southern hemisphere wine producing regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although he said climate problems were not solely to blame for the drastic fall, "the most important challenge that the sector faces is climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that the grapevine, as a long-lived plant cultivated in often vulnerable areas, is strongly affected by climate change," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France bucked the falling harvest trend, with a four percent rise, making it by far the world's biggest wine producer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine consumption last year was however at its lowest level since 1996, confirming a fall-off over the last five years, according to the figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trend is partly due to price rises caused by inflation and a sharp fall in wine drinking in China – down a quarter.

    US top court ponders 'rule for the ages' in Trump case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters outside the US Supreme Court urge the justices to reject Trump's arguments on immunity. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750582_1_L_20240426013833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Thursday on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution and appeared poised to issue a ruling that could further delay Donald Trump's trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic case -- the last in the court's current term – has far-reaching implications for executive power and Trump's multiple legal issues as he seeks the White House again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're writing a rule for the ages," said Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of three conservative justices appointed to the nation's highest court by the former Republican president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least four, and possibly five, of the conservative justices on the nine-member court appeared to take issue with a lower court ruling that a former president does not enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution after leaving office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, told Michael Dreeben, representing Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the election conspiracy charges against Trump, that he had "concerns" with the lower court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As I read it, it says simply, 'a former president can be prosecuted because he's being prosecuted,'" Roberts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why shouldn't we either send (the case) back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sending the case back to the lower court for further review would almost certainly delay Trump's election conspiracy trial until after the November vote, when he is expected to face off once again against Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Justice Samuel Alito, another conservative, asked why – without immunity – a president won't just "pardon themselves from anything that they might have been conceivably charged with committing?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Sauer, representing Trump, told the court that "without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution there can be no presidency as we know it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office," Sauer said. (AFP)

    Former partners to seek to oust Scots leader

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Scottish Green Party will vote against Scotland's Humza Yousaf in a vote of no confidence in him as first minister, a source within the party said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yousaf's other opponents said earlier on Thursday they would seek to oust him as Scotland's leader after his Scottish National Party abandoned a coalition with the Greens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yousaf, who serves as first minister in Scotland's devolved government, ended the alliance on Thursday. The arrangement had come under strain after a decision to scrap a climate change emissions reduction target last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP has led Scotland's devolved government since 2011, but its fortunes faltered since a funding scandal and the resignation of a party leader last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party holds broadly centre-left views, but its coalition with the Greens had highlighted splits over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters on social and environmental issues beyond its core call for independence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, a YouGov poll put the main British opposition Labour Party slightly ahead of the SNP in Scotland for the first time since Scottish voters chose to remain part of the United Kingdom in an independence referendum in 2014. (Reuters)

    NY court overturns Weinstein rape conviction

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harvey Weinstein's 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned by New York's highest court, reopening the landmark case that launched the #MeToo movement and highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men accountable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a bitterly divided 4-3 decision on Thursday, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting women testify that Weinstein assaulted them, even though their accusations were not part of the charges he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined on a broad range of "loathsome" conduct, including bullying and fits of anger toward associates, that portrayed him in a "highly prejudicial" light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behaviour that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges," Judge Jenny Rivera wrote for the majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a prison in upstate Rome, New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is not expected to be freed immediately, as he also faces a separate 16-year prison term in California after being convicted there last year for the 2013 rape of an actress at a Los Angeles hotel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose predecessor Cyrus Vance brought the New York case, will decide whether to retry Weinstein.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault," Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, said in an email. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's latest Shenzhou-18 manned space mission blasted off on Thursday, with three astronauts making their way to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rocket, carrying astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the northwest province of Gansu at 8.59pm. Xinhua reported that the crew completed their docking at about 3.30am and were able to board a couple of hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Lipeng, the centre's director, declared the launch mission a complete success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Long March-2F Y18 rocket has sent Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship to the intended orbit accurately... I hereby announce that Shenzhou-18 has been launched successfully," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio will stay in orbit for six months, during which they will carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material and life science, space medicine and space technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will create an "aquarium" and raise zebrafish and algae in zero gravity, to study how the space environment affects their growth and the aquatic ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew will also cultivate plants in an experiment to help with designing crops that adapt to outer space conditions. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    'Mainland Citybus drivers may affect locals' jobs'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Unionists say they do not wish to resort to taking industrial action. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750543_1_L_20240425190732.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport unionists on Thursday spoke out against a decision by Citybus to import 20 drivers from the mainland, saying they are worried that more will come in the future and affect the jobs of local drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus said the first five of the 20 approved bus captains who arrive here next month will take a driving test before they’re allowed to start work, adding that they will only work on non-franchised routes, such as services for employees and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Motor Transport Workers General Union said it is worried that this is just the beginning, and that Citybus will bring in more non-local workers to operate on franchised routes down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, noted that the hourly salary of a mainland bus captain is slightly lower than that of a local, and expressed worries that local drivers may get a pay cut in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung Nuen-yui from the union's Citybus section said the company should offer better remuneration packages for local recruits before importing drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are new recruits, but not many of them stay in the company. This shows that there are issues with the pay, welfare, shift arrangements, working location and hours. I hope the company will solve these problems before looking into other solutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group added that it is arranging a meeting with Citybus and the authorities, and it does not wish to resort to taking industrial action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citybus, for its part, said it prioritises local workers and offers a bonus exclusively to new local employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department also said in response that it has taken into account the welfare of local drivers before allowing Citybus to import drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said the bus operator has proven that it was not able to hire suitable local drivers, adding that these imported drivers are not allowed to run franchised routes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.

    Manage China-US relationship 'responsibly': Blinken
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China and the United States to manage their relationship "responsibly" as he went on a charm offensive in Shanghai, ahead of talks with top central government officials in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken's visit to Shanghai has seen him sample local food, watch a basketball game and stroll along the city's famous Bund promenade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting with Chen Jining, Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, America's top diplomat said US President Joe Biden was committed to "direct and sustained" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen too stressed the need to build stable ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken on Thursday also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, where he voiced hope for more Americans to study in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the US was committed to welcoming Chinese students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also met American business leaders in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He then headed for Beijing, where he's expected to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi and possibly President Xi Jinping on Friday. (AFP & agencies)

    'Lo Wu will be busy during Golden Week'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Thursday said they expect Lo Wu will be the busiest border crossing during the mainland's "Golden Week" holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee projected almost six million arrivals and departures for the week, with some 800,000 mainland tourists expected to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said Labour Day on May 1 is tipped to be the busiest day, with arrivals and departures reaching one million at land checkpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that between April 30 and May 5, an average of around 200,000 rail journeys a day are expected through Lo Wu, and 170,000 via Lok Ma Chau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An average of 130,000 journeys a day are expected for the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department's boundary division commander, Ng Hoi-ka, said travellers are advised to use the department's mobile app for real-time border traffic information, so they can see how busy the different checkpoints are.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on travellers to avoid crossing the border during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all travellers cross the border during the peak hours at the same time, there's bound to be some congestion and longer waiting times. So we urge everyone, if you can, please avoid the peak hours," she said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally speaking, for departures, it starts getting crowded from eight in the morning, and it'd be the busiest between 10 and 12 o'clock."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that her department has prepared for the busy week by curbing holidays for frontline officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A control centre will be set up along with other departments to monitor checkpoint operations, so officers can respond to any emergencies.

    Landmark 'Moulin Rouge' in Paris loses windmill blades

<div class="itemFullText">
 The blades of the windmill on top of the Moulin Rouge cabaret, one of the most famous landmarks in Paris, collapsed during the night, firefighters on Thursday said, just months before the French capital hosts the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The letters M, O and U had also been toppled from the name spelled out on the building's facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the reason for the accident was not yet known, the Moulin Rouge's director Jean-Victor Clerico said there was no sign of "foul play", adding the cause was "obviously a technical problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No-one was hurt and there was no risk of further collapse, Paris firefighters said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. The club was founded in 1889 and the audience for its dance shows is largely made up of tourist groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of people watch the cabaret's daily shows each year, with many more stopping to look from the outside at the landmark at the foot of the Montmartre hill. (Agencies)

    HK to host Fencing Foil World Cup
   </title>
   <link>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will host a FIE Foil World Cup for the first time next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong leg, at AsiaWorld-Expo, will mark the last Foil World Cup of the season, with up to 400 elite foilists from 30 countries and regions coming to compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them are men's world number one Nick Itkin and women's world number one Lee Kiefer, both from the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition represents an important warm-up opportunity for homegrown Olympians Edgar Cheung and Daphne Chan before they head to Paris for the Olympics. Cheung said he's excited to fence on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot because we use to travel around the world to fence in the World Cup to compete. Now it is a good opportunity that we can fence in Hong Kong, and all the Hong Kong people can cheer for us with Cantonese, which is really touching," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's kind of like a training for me this competition to prepare for the Olympics. If I have any mistakes in physical or mental that I did not do good, I can now realise and I still have time to prepare and to be better, and even my coach can see what happens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicholas Choi, who was part of the team that won bronze at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said it's incredible for Hong Kong to host an international event and for many big names to come to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Back in my days when I was younger, there wasn't a lot of international competitions but now slowly and slowly, there are more and more happening. I think it is really good for the development, for the youngsters, and also for fencing, it's the first time for us in foil that we're actually hosting a World Cup competition, so I think it is a really big step for us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also think that we're also hosting the World Championship in two years. This would be a really good stepping stone for us to even prepare the World Championship in a better way so I think it is a really good thing for us and everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chan said she doesn't want to set specific expectations for herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this World Cup is pretty much the same as the usual ones and it just keeps my condition. There are many competitions to keep me at my best level, so I hope I can perform better on the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone in the competition is my competitor, but I just want to try my best, fence them and achieve better results."

    House Speaker heckled as protests spread on campuses

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Students at the encampment on the Columbia University campus say their protest is peaceful. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750502_1_L_20240425160736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University students heckled US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as he visited the flashpoint of nationwide student demonstrations over the Israeli war in Gaza, even as the New York school agreed to 48 more hours of negotiations to end a protest encampment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Johnson's visit, which he said was meant to support Jewish students intimidated by some anti-Israeli demonstrators, took place shortly after the university extended a deadline from Wednesday morning to Friday morning to reach an agreement to remove an encampment that has come to symbolise the campus protest movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the campus protests taking place coast to coast were met with shows of force from law enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Texas on Wednesday, state highway patrol troopers in riot gear and police on horseback broke up a protest at the University of Texas in Austin and arrested 20 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Southern California declared its campus closed and asked the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to clear a demonstration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested students who peacefully surrendered one-by-one, hours after campus police who took down an encampment were overwhelmed by protesters and requested LAPD help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demonstrations took place at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and California State Polytechnic in Humboldt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesting students have demanded universities divest assets from Israel and seek to pressure the US government to rein in Israeli strikes on Palestinian civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's fierce response followed a deadly October 7 cross-border raid by Islamist militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza enclave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The at times vulgar heckling and booing that greeted Johnson did not drown him out, though he was hard to hear because he spoke to media microphones, not through loudspeakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Columbia has allowed these lawless radicals and agitators to take over, the virus of anti-semitism has spread across other campuses," Johnson said from the steps of the university library, calling on violent protesters to be arrested and threatening to cut off federal funding to universities that fail impose order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a politically polarised country, conservatives can score points by being seen as standing up to liberal activists, many of whom say the Republican portrayals of anti-semitic violence on campus are greatly exaggerated for political purposes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson also met with Jewish students who said they were fearful to come onto the campus, citing testimony from Jewish students who said they had been spat on and seen swastikas drawn on the walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before his press conference, Johnson met with about 40 Jewish students on campus, according to students who were there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students at the encampment say their protest has been peaceful, and that outsiders not connected with their movement are behind any inflammatory confrontations off-campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We regret that there's no attention on this peaceful movement and politicians are diverting attention from the real issues," said Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student at Columbia who has been part of the negotiations with school administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Free speech advocates PEN America called the sudden escalation at the University of Texas "deeply alarming."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The administration should be doing everything in their power to keep their students safe and the campus operating, but calling the state police to disperse a peaceful protest that had barely begun does the opposite," Kristen Shahverdian, PEN's campus free speech program director, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The political reverberations reached the White House, where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden believes free speech, debate and non-discrimination are important on college campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to see this be peaceful," Jean-Pierre said in Wednesday's press briefing. "It is important that students feel safe... It should not be violent, it should not be hateful rhetoric." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Thursday said they arrested two former directors of an online household product store on suspicion of failing to supply pre-paid products to customers, a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said they had received 451 complaints against the company as of 8am on Thursday, and the complainants had made prepaid orders to the company, involving around HK$400,000 worth of household goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the customers didn't receive the products - or refunds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The online shop shut down earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs officials said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 38, on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released on bail and officers did not rule out the possibility of making more arrests.

    Non-plastic utensil firms show off their products

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies supplying alternatives to plastic cutlery on Thursday demonstrated how their products fare, with one showing how to put its straw into a sealed drink and another attempting to cut a steak with its knife and fork.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Environmental Protection Department has launched an online platform to help people and businesses find suppliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The platform invited four suppliers to demonstrate their products to the press. One of them, Ecoinno, poured boiling water inside a container to prove it can tolerate high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its CEO, George Chen, said business has gone up by 70 percent since the disposable utensil ban took effect on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So rules and regulations are extremely important, and we believe the windows are here. So it depends on when customers want to pick things up. It's no more to replace,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The new product will allow [restaurants] to stay away from just price competition because [the non-plastic products] are sustainable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said his containers contain leak-proof materials and are 10 percent more expensive than other plastic alternatives on the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said despite this, many hotels, hospitals and schools have been placing orders because they like the high quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What are the values that they can get on it besides turnover? So this is what we are talking about. Can it, for example, be reheated? You see.. after [being heated] by 100 degrees water, it stays exactly the way that it is,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier, Supply Ching Company, demonstrated how to scoop up a portion of sticky rice with its spoon. Its founder, Alvis Yip, said his company will advise restaurants how to pick between the two types of spoon it offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have two kinds of spoon in the market now. We have the rice spoon and the soup spoon. The rice spoon is specially designed for rice because it has a straight lined design. So the [spoons] can go directly into the rice, but the soup spoon is actually designed for just holding the soup and the noodles. So to use it as a rice spoon, it will be a bit soft and weak,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Usually when the restaurant approaches us, we will gather the information of what kind of product they sell. So we will suggest the suitable cutlery for them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak. The fork snapped during two attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supplier explained that the forks are designed with detachable handles, saying this makes them weaker and more prone to breakage once the handles have been detached multiple times.

    'Anti-migrant sentiment pushes domestic workers away'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sringatin, second left, says foreign domestic workers are looking at destinations other than Hong Kong for work. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750478_1_L_20240425125635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Migrant domestic worker activists have called for a stop to people who accuse workers of prematurely terminating their contracts to change employers, saying anti-migrant sentiment in Hong Kong would discourage them from staying in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, on Thursday said foreign domestic workers preferred destinations other than the SAR because of better conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is not the only place for domestic workers to find a job. There is also competition between Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Malaysia and other countries... If Hong Kong continues [to have] more restrictions on domestic workers, I think many people will leave Hong Kong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please stop [job-hopping] accusations, please stop doing anti-migrant policies, because it's not only stopping migrants from coming to Hong Kong, but it also makes the image of Hong Kong become very bad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiela Tebia, the chairperson of Gabriela Hong Kong, said foreign domestic workers had been singled out for changing employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [workers] are not content with their working conditions in the company, they can easily send a resignation letter and find another job that gives them a better working conditions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why does it become an issue when domestic workers want to have a better working condition? Why is the migrant workers community criminalised because of wanting to change employers?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun earlier said a revised code of practice for employment agencies, aimed at deterring foreign domestic workers from changing employers mid-contract, would be promulgated in the second quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the planned changes, firms would be asked to explain clearly to helpers on requirements to change employers and employment agencies would be banned from providing monetary incentives for workers to quit early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Immigration Department refused about 500 employment visa applications from foreign domestic workers for suspected job-hopping.

    Plastic packaging ok for now: environment bureau

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau clarified that shops could still use plastic containers to pack takeaway food, after a supermarket chain was found using paper food boxes to pack sushi, much to the irritation of some customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photo went viral online, showing Japanese discount retailer DON DON DONKI using non-plastic, non-transparent containers to pack sushi, with netizens describing that as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching out through its “Big Waster” social media account, the bureau said using plastic packaging was still ok for now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This situation is the same with takeaways, so supermarkets can still use plastic boxes and lids to pack takeout sushi. Of course, they can also use transparent boxes, so customers can clearly distinguish the food quality and types," it wrote on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) also reassured people that purchasing or using disposable plastics will not lead to any legal violations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the EPD clarified that eating inside a food court in a shopping mall or a department store is considered as dine-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it stressed that the plastic ban does not apply to pre-packaged food products displayed on shelves in food courts, because these products can be seen as takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

    Heat stun Celtics to level playoff series

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat unleashed a barrage of three-pointers to score a series-levelling 111-101 upset over the top-seeded Boston Celtics in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff duel on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eighth seeds Miami, playing without the injured Jimmy Butler, produced a battling performance to knot the best-of-seven-series at 1-1 as the teams head back to Florida for game three on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyler Herro led the Miami scoring with 24 points, part of a balanced offensive effort that saw all five Heat starters post double-digit points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the key to the Miami victory was their accuracy from long-range, with the Heat draining 23 three-pointers from 43 attempts compared to Boston's 12 of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Herro knocked down six threes while Caleb Martin added five in his tally of 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston, meanwhile, was led by 33 points from Jaylen Brown, with Jayson Tatum finishing with 28 in a losing effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was all the more unexpected given Miami's 20-point drubbing by Boston in game one on Sunday – something Herro said had motivated the Heat for game two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We lost badly in game one and everybody responded tonight, and that's that's all you can ask for from a group of guys," Herro said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another trademark display of defiance from Miami, who are aiming to emulate their playoff run of last season when they reached the NBA Finals after entering the postseason via the play-in tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't even want to mention last year, this year is a whole new year," Herro said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We feel like we have a great group of guys. We're not fully healthy, but we have guys who want to play and want to be out here making a difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This playoff opportunity is big for everybody. We just love to compete." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (right) talks with US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns (centre) and the US Consul General in Shanghai, Scott Walker, during a basketball game in Shanghai. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750450_1_L_20240425092456.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is due to meet business leaders in Shanghai on Thursday, the second day of a three-day visit to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken is due to wrap up his visit in Beijing on Friday, with talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an increase in contacts between China and the US recently - including a summit between President Xi and President Joe Biden - a Shanghai-based expert says he's pessimistic about the future of relations between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I remain a pessimist. I've been a pessimist on US-China relations since the Alaska meetings that took place shortly after Biden took office. I was hopeful that we would see a significant improvement after the Trump years," Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics at East China Normal University, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very concerned that Trump may be re-elected. I think a lot of people in the world are concerned about that. But whether he's re-elected or not, you know, if Biden is re-elected or Trump, I think we all anticipate that things are going to continue to get worse," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mahoney stressed there were some areas where both countries must work together - in their own best interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that they have to cooperate on some very basic issues," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included the global financial system "because both countries depend on that substantially, not only for their own bilateral trade, but for the global trade system as a whole", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If China doesn't go along with the dollar or the way that the system works from the US point of view, then that threatens the US economy as well. So there is some shared concern there. We've also heard reports that they might be discussing other issues that won't be well-publicised, perhaps including militarisation in space," Mahoney said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said issues like climate change and increased cooperation seem to have "slipped far from the conversation, despite it being a growing existential concern" for both sides.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kewell's Yokohama F-Marinos set up an Asian Champions League final showdown with Al Ain after beating Ulsan Hyundai 5-4 on penalties to win a pulsating semi-final on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trailing 1-0 from last week's first leg in South Korea, Yokohama scored three goals in the opening 30 minutes of the return fixture in Japan but then conceded twice and had a man sent off before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game finished 3-3 on aggregate after extra time in constant driving rain, before goalkeeper William Popp saved from Ulsan's Kim Min-woo in the shoot-out to hand Yokohama the advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carlos Eduardo converted the decisive spot-kick to send Yokohama, who former Liverpool and Leeds forward Kewell took over as coach at the start of the year, into their first Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ulsan, who had already booked their place in next year's 32-team Club World Cup in the United States by winning the semi-final first leg, were looking for their third Champions League title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama will host Al Ain in the first leg of the final on May 11, with the return being held in the United Arab Emirates on May 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ain beat Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 5-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to reach the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama made a blistering start and took the lead in the 13th minute when a defensive mix-up between Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Seok-ho allowed Asahi Uenaka to streak through and score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama looked capable of scoring more and it was little surprise when Anderson Lopes added a second in the 21st minute, firing home a left-foot shot from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home side kept up the pressure and Uenaka notched his second of the game on the half-hour mark when he slipped his marker and curled a shot past goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as it looked like turning into a rout, Ulsan hit back when Matheus Sales headed home direct from a corner in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later, Ulsan had a penalty and Yokohama were reduced to 10 men when Takumi Kamijima was red-carded for a handball as he slid in to make a tackle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.02 percent to 5,072 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10 percent, to 15,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, to 38,461.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are eyeing first quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March on Friday. Hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March had pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Boeing fell 2.8 percent after the planemaker reported its first quarterly revenue drop in seven quarters, even though the result beat analyst expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solar inverter maker Enphase Energy dropped 5.5 percent after projecting second-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pedro Sanchez has put public duties on hold. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750424_1_L_20240425032512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he will suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife's private dealings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on Monday, April 29 to announce his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to pause and think," he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. "I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias – Clean Hands – whose leader has links to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the People's Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had "collaborated" with those circulating the claims against his wife.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: "We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say the driver of a school bus died after he accidentally fell from the vehicle, which then rolled over him in Diamond Hill on Wednesday, while in a separate incident a driver was killed in Lau Fau Shan when his truck slid down a slope, trapping him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 47-year-old bus driver was preparing to leave the car park of a housing estate on Hammer Hill Road not long after 4pm when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man suffered multiple injuries but was conscious when he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He later lost consciousness  where he was declared dead just after 9.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 6.30pm, police were called to Lau Fau Shan to reports that a man was trapped between a medium-sized truck and some water tanks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers say that initial investigations show that the man had parked the truck, which was linked to a container trailer and the water tanks, on a slope near Fung Kong Tsuen Road. After he got out, police believe the truck rolled backwards, leaving him trapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were able to release the 67-year-old driver but he was declared dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kowloon East police are looking into the Diamond Hill incident while officers in New Territories North are checking on the Lau Fau Shan case.

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    First Ukraine aid to arrive in hours: Biden

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as US$1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)

    'Productivity and quality key to HK's competitiveness'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mohamed Butt (right) says unleashing new quality productive forces can help attract more businesses to the SAR. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750376_1_L_20240425002313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) said new ways to increase economic productivity could help retain the SAR's status as a supply chain hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “New quality productive forces” — a concept introduced by President Xi Jinping and highlighted in Premier Li Qiang’s work report — refer to productivity increases helped by breakthroughs in technology, rather than in traditional industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, the council's executive director, Mohamed Butt, said new quality productive forces, also known as NPF, could help attract more businesses to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This NPF can empower the growth of new industrialisation, as well as enhance our capability to become a stronger base for exports. I think in the budget speech, the Secretary for Finance mentioned that Hong Kong needs to become an international supply chain hub," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In conclusion, I think NPF can really bring in new people, new ideas, new businesses, and enhance our capability to become a stronger base for supply chain hub for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of HKPC and lawmaker, Sunny Tan, said new quality productive forces could enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about being innovative, being able to apply new technologies in industrial development and the product development side with new products, new materials, new production processes, and also new ways of distribution," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, productive forces, really, it's about getting all stages, doing it right with, again, innovation and technology to enhance our competitiveness along the entire supply chain."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

    Boeing reports Q1 loss amid ongoing crisis

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

    HKEX will continue to go international: outgoing chair

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Laura Cha says Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will continue to develop its global connectivity, as she steps down from her role as chairwoman. Photo: Online meeting" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750387_1_L_20240424185647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.

    Blinken in China for key three-day visit

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in China for a three-day visit as the two countries try to keep relations on an even keel amid differences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken landed in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon where he will meet students and business leaders. He'll later head to Beijing and hold talks with top Chinese officials there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides are expected to discuss issues such as Ukraine, regional peace and stability, and fentanyl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Blinken's second visit to China in less than a year, following up on recent phone talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency noted that bilateral ties have begun to stabilise since the two leaders met in San Francisco last November, with significant exchanges in various fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains committed to open dialogue and communication with the United States. However, Washington must recognise that dialogue must be based on equality and respect, and actions must align with words," Xinhua said. (Agencies)

    Audit Commission urges rehabus to scale up services
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Audit Commission says rehabus operators should review their routes and improve patronage. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750361_1_L_20240424164335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday called on a minibus operator catering for the disabled to beef up its services, saying it turned down requests for pre-booked trips even though vehicles were available.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In its report, the watchdog said the government-subsidised rehabus operator rejected 21,425 orders for door-to-door transportation in 2023, double the figure recorded in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were on average nine to 42 spare vehicles on a weekday from 2019 to last year, the body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission added that around one-fifth of the 121 fixed routes averaged six or even fewer passengers a month, while the waiting list for services had become longer, with someone on it for almost two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Routes running between hospitals, clinics and MTR stations operated by another company were also under-used, the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among 12 hospital routes, three were transporting zero passengers 80 percent of the time in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said the operators should review their routes and improve patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added the Transport Department should look at requests to purchase more rehabus vehicles carefully, noting the operators did not report on the utilisation of existing vehicles when asking the government for funding to buy new ones from 2021 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  124 vehicles costing HK$135 million in total were procured from 2018 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner for Transport, for her part, said she agreed with the audit recommendations.

    China slams US military aid package to Taiwan
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has condemned the latest package of US military assistance to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Senate on Tuesday passed US$95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package included US$8 billion for the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid seriously violates US commitments to China and sends a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affair and does not tolerate any external interference," spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said US military support for the island only increased the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to emphasise that the United States and Taiwan strengthening military ties will not bring about security for Taiwan," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will only increase tensions and the risk of conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and will ultimately be an act of shooting oneself in the foot." (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.

 The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that officials plan to look into the feasibility of expanding a mental health support hotline to other platforms, such as instant messaging apps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 18111 hotline which launched last December has been receiving around 350 calls per day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said those seeking help wanted to talk about issues such as mental distress, family relationships, physical health problems and work pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the hotline operators have referred around 200 people to different organisations for support, and two urgent cases to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said officials have been regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the service and it could be expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the outcome of the review of the operation, we will consider the feasibility of extending the service to other platforms (such as instant messaging software) in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Mental Health in due course," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials plan to ask an independent organisation to conduct a full service evaluation study in the third quarter of the year, to collect views from NGOs and other stakeholders through questionnaires and focus groups.

    Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Wednesday called on the government to improve labour protection, boost benefits for public servants and increase the city's minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nine labour and civil service unions issued a "Labour Day Declaration" ahead of May 1, with 10 policy suggestions, including an end to further labour imports and improving occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, Lee Kwok-keung, said the city’s minimum hourly wage should be increased by HK$15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While our proposed increase from HK$40 an hour to HK$55 seems substantial, we should bear in mind the fact that a basic lunch can easily cost HK$55. If the minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost of a meal, it's not really reasonable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, meanwhile, noted a recent 0.1 percentage point increase in Hong Kong's unemployment rate, meaning an extra 9,400 people – 111,700 in total – were out of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, urged the government to provide a job-matching service for businesses participating in labour importation schemes, with the aim of getting them to prioritise local people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federation of HKSAR Civil Servants, Lee Fong-chung, said there is a need for the government to come up with policies to address staff shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the annual retirement rate for senior government positions has hit 10 percent and there has been a "huge" number of resignations in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think it's very important for the government to refill the vacancies as soon as possible, through regular recruitment or transferring some contract [workers] onto permanent terms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the number of government workers in their 20s and 30s resigning has been particularly high and more family-friendly policies are needed to keep hold of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Like [increasing] maternity leave… And also, the government may amend some policy on the long-term investment for the civil servants, like they can use a portion of their pension fund for them to buy a house or to buy medical insurance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Government Employees Association, Cheung Hoi-wing, added that many civil servants have chosen to retire in mainland cities in recent years and the government should extend civil servant healthcare benefits to cover the whole Greater Bay Area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

    Officials advised to learn lessons from toilet saga

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Officials were forced to take action to restore public confidence in the 'smart toilet' after a user became trapped inside.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials tasked with revitalising countryside areas are being urged to learn lessons over a HK$13 million "smart toilet" which turned out to be anything but.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Users of the toilet in the New Territories village of Lai Chi Wo were promised a hands-free experience, with the amenity boasting automatic sliding doors that opened and closed with just a wave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two years of construction, the toilet was completed in the summer of 2023 and was trumpeted as a showpiece facility that could boost the image of countryside washrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it all went down the pan not long after it opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On 9 December 2023, a user was locked up inside the new public toilet as the automatic sliding door could not be opened by waving hands over the control panel or pressing the emergency button," the Audit Commission noted in a report on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was later discovered that special panels installed on the roof of the toilet, which were meant to purify air as well as generate electricity, were not producing enough power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the automatic door system was subsequently disabled and the sliding doors converted to manual operation "to restore the public’s confidence over the usage of the toilet".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that as well as supposedly being "smart", the toilet was also originally estimated to have been almost HK$5 million cheaper than it was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission said the Countryside Conservation Office responsible for the project should draw on the experience it gained with the toilet when it embarks on other minor improvement works in the future.
