<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government's office for attracting skilled workers to the city will host a global talent summit and expo at the Exhibition and Convention Centre in Wan Chai between May 7 and 8, to encourage more people to move to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Director of Hong Kong Talent Engage, Anthony Lau, on Tuesday said nearly 100 firms, public bodies and government departments were expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20 people will share their outlooks on the global job market and talent movement trends, as well as opportunities and exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said admission is free, and locals can also take part. The event will be broadcast live online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his office would provide information on different talent entry schemes, as well as support services for non-locals on how they can move to Hong Kong, offering advice on issues such as housing and education for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau noted that in the past year, finance and IT were among the sectors that attracted the most non-local talent to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For talent coming to Hong Kong, most of them are very interested in tips on every-day life. They also want more opportunities to learn Cantonese and practice the language," Lau told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said with Cantonese classes being so popular, his office would hold dozens more of them this year.

 Two Malaysian navy helicopters collided in mid-air during a rehearsal on Tuesday for a naval parade, killing all 10 crew members aboard, the country's navy said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Naval officials said the incident occurred at the Lumut base in the western state of Perak on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All victims were confirmed dead at the scene and sent to the Lumut base military hospital for identification," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video circulating on local media showed several helicopters flying in formation, when one of the choppers' rotor clipped another before both aircraft crashed into the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The navy said it would carry out an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the aircraft - a maritime operations helicopter and a Fennec military chopper - were rehearsing for a parade celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Royal Malaysian Navy, due to be held on Saturday. (Reuters)

    Workers not supposed to enter manhole: minister
   </title>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the families of two workers who died in a manhole in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Initial investigations showed the pair inhaled hydrogen sulfide and fainted while working in the manhole. They were later certified dead at the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said relevant departments were looking into the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that the Drainage Services Department has started reviewing the safety of similar works, and related works have been suspended," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the Labour Department can conduct a detailed investigation as soon as possible to look into the cause of the accident. We will wait for the result of the investigation before we take follow up actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that various stakeholders had the responsibility to prevent industrial accidents from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the investigation would focus on the workers’ decision to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Workers should not be asked to enter manholes when they clean the drainage. They just have to spray water with high-pressure from above ground," she said during a Legco panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So why did the workers enter the manhole, leading to fatalities? That is one of the directions of the investigation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A code of practice for safety and health at work in confined spaces was first introduced in 2000, and the government earlier said it planned to revise the code of practice in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said it had suspended the contractors from tendering for public works related to roads and drainage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The contractors concerned have to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. The contractors are required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures," a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said the suspension would only be lifted if the contractors demonstrated an effective safety management system.

    At least five die trying to cross English Channel

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least five people have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, according to French authorities, hours after Britain approved its migrant deportation bill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The regional Voix du Nord newspaper said the bodies were discovered at the Wimereaux beach in northern France on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local officials said about 110 migrants were crowded onto a small boat when panic broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither local authorities nor the coast guard could say how many people had been rescued or could be missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard was still carrying out search-and-rescue operations at sea, a spokesperson said, after what the official called a "busy" morning, with several crossing attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports of the deaths came only hours after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s latest effort to send some migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda finally won approval from Parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UK government plans to deport some of those who enter the country illegally as a deterrent to migrants who risk their lives in hopes they will be able to claim asylum once they reach Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Human rights groups have described the legislation as inhumane and cruel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the United Nations refugee agency and the Council of Europe called on Britain to rethink its plans for fears they could damage international cooperation on tackling the global migrant crisis. (Agencies)

    HK doesn't need a 'fake news' law, says CE

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday dismissed the need for legislation against "fake news", stressing the media sector's ability to improve credibility through professionalism and self-discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee acknowledged improvements in the dissemination of accurate information and praised the efforts of journalists' groups to combat misinformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the media industry is committed to maintaining the integrity of news reporting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will monitor the situation but my take is that if this problem can be addressed by enhancing professionalism, then it should be our first choice. We need to work together. There is no need for legislation. I always think that we can handle this issue with self-discipline as well as professionalism," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE's remarks came after Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the SCMP in an interview that the government has ruled out introducing a fake news law, an idea proposed by the previous administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said legislation in this area would be challenging due to complex legal issues surrounding the definition of fake news.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is aiming to roll out a scheme in the third quarter of the year to encourage people to rejoin the workforce.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme announced in his policy address in 2023, elderly and middle-aged people who have not been in paid employment for three consecutive months or more will be entitled to an allowance after working for at least six straight months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event organised by the Federation of Trade Unions marking the upcoming Labour Day, Lee also said the government will fine-tune the review mechanism of the city's minimum wage, as part of measures to better protect the rights of employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hailed their contributions to the city’s economic and social development, noting that authorities are going all out to stimulate the economy while improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This year's Labour Day is the first Labour Day in the SAR after the enactment of Article 23 of the Basic Law... We can [now] spare no effort to fight for the city’s economic growth, pursue development, improve people's livelihoods, and have all wage earners pursue happiness in a safe and stable environment,” he said.

    Officials advised to learn lessons from toilet saga

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Officials were forced to take action to restore public confidence in the 'smart toilet' after a user became trapped inside.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials tasked with revitalising countryside areas are being urged to learn lessons over a HK$13 million "smart toilet" which turned out to be anything but.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Users of the toilet in the New Territories village of Lai Chi Wo were promised a hands-free experience, with the amenity boasting automatic sliding doors that opened and closed with just a wave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two years of construction, the toilet was completed in the summer of 2023 and was trumpeted as a showpiece facility that could boost the image of countryside washrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it all went down the pan not long after it opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On 9 December 2023, a user was locked up inside the new public toilet as the automatic sliding door could not be opened by waving hands over the control panel or pressing the emergency button," the Audit Commission noted in a report on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was later discovered that special panels installed on the roof of the toilet, which were meant to purify air as well as generate electricity, were not producing enough power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the automatic door system was subsequently disabled and the sliding doors converted to manual operation "to restore the public’s confidence over the usage of the toilet".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that as well as supposedly being "smart", the toilet was also originally estimated to have been almost HK$5 million cheaper than it was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission said the Countryside Conservation Office responsible for the project should draw on the experience it gained with the toilet when it embarks on other minor improvement works in the future.

    Expert not optimistic about US-China links

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (right) talks with US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns (centre) and the US Consul General in Shanghai, Scott Walker, during a basketball game in Shanghai. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750450_1_L_20240425092456.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is due to meet business leaders in Shanghai on Thursday, the second day of a three-day visit to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken is due to wrap up his visit in Beijing on Friday, with talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an increase in contacts between China and the US recently - including a summit between President Xi and President Joe Biden - a Shanghai-based expert says he's pessimistic about the future of relations between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I remain a pessimist. I've been a pessimist on US-China relations since the Alaska meetings that took place shortly after Biden took office. I was hopeful that we would see a significant improvement after the Trump years," Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics at East China Normal University, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very concerned that Trump may be re-elected. I think a lot of people in the world are concerned about that. But whether he's re-elected or not, you know, if Biden is re-elected or Trump, I think we all anticipate that things are going to continue to get worse," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mahoney stressed there were some areas where both countries must work together - in their own best interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that they have to cooperate on some very basic issues," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included the global financial system "because both countries depend on that substantially, not only for their own bilateral trade, but for the global trade system as a whole", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If China doesn't go along with the dollar or the way that the system works from the US point of view, then that threatens the US economy as well. So there is some shared concern there. We've also heard reports that they might be discussing other issues that won't be well-publicised, perhaps including militarisation in space," Mahoney said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said issues like climate change and increased cooperation seem to have "slipped far from the conversation, despite it being a growing existential concern" for both sides.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Wednesday began a three-day debate on the financial secretary's budget blueprint, with many of them praising Paul Chan's efforts to boost the economy despite a deficit of more than HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Various lawmakers lauded Chan for responding to their demands, such as removing all property-cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said the financial secretary offered much support to the people and various business sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The budget actively promotes the comprehensive development of our economy. There are measures to support the SMEs in tapping foreign markets. There's also support for IT development. It will build a Hong Kong brand comprehensively," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB chair also said it's high time Hong Kong reviewed comprehensively its advantages and complemented other cities in the Greater Bay Area, so that the region can enjoy development synergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Business and Professionals Alliance chairman Lo Wai-kwok described Paul Chan as a "master chef" who came up with "popular and healthy dishes" despite the budget shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The secretary has been tightening the purse strings while rolling out a series of measures to stimulate the economy so as to make sure government initiatives would be popular. It's not an easy task," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, meanwhile, said officials should look into widening Hong Kong's tax base as soon as possible, noting the public coffers would be hit particularly hard during economic downturns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vote on the budget is scheduled to take place in two weeks.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pedro Sanchez has put public duties on hold. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750424_1_L_20240425032512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he will suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife's private dealings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on Monday, April 29 to announce his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to pause and think," he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. "I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias – Clean Hands – whose leader has links to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the People's Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had "collaborated" with those circulating the claims against his wife.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: "We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this." (Reuters)

    Feyenoord boss Slot leading race for Liverpool job

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Arne Slot led Feyenoord to their first Eredivisie title in six years last season. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750243_1_L_20240424011914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord coach Arne Slot has emerged as the leading contender to succeed Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, according to British media reports on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slot, 45, led Feyenoord to their first league title in six years last season and won the Dutch Cup on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had been a front runner to take over at Tottenham a year ago before ruling himself out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky Sports, the BBC and The Times all reported that Slot is now leading the race for the unenviable task of following Klopp at Anfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Reds could face competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona, who are also looking for new coaches next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite when Klopp announced his decision in January to stand down at the end of the season after nearly nine years in the role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool vacancy but reportedly held talks with West Ham on Monday about replacing David Moyes next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand. (AFP)

    Audit Commission urges rehabus to scale up services
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Audit Commission says rehabus operators should review their routes and improve patronage. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750361_1_L_20240424164335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday called on a minibus operator catering for the disabled to beef up its services, saying it turned down requests for pre-booked trips even though vehicles were available.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In its report, the watchdog said the government-subsidised rehabus operator rejected 21,425 orders for door-to-door transportation in 2023, double the figure recorded in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were on average nine to 42 spare vehicles on a weekday from 2019 to last year, the body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission added that around one-fifth of the 121 fixed routes averaged six or even fewer passengers a month, while the waiting list for services had become longer, with someone on it for almost two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Routes running between hospitals, clinics and MTR stations operated by another company were also under-used, the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among 12 hospital routes, three were transporting zero passengers 80 percent of the time in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said the operators should review their routes and improve patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added the Transport Department should look at requests to purchase more rehabus vehicles carefully, noting the operators did not report on the utilisation of existing vehicles when asking the government for funding to buy new ones from 2021 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  124 vehicles costing HK$135 million in total were procured from 2018 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner for Transport, for her part, said she agreed with the audit recommendations.

    Boeing reports Q1 loss amid ongoing crisis

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

    China introduces fresh crew for Tiangong space station

<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Manned Space Agency on Wednesday introduced the crew for the Shenzhou-18 mission, the latest in a programme that aims to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trio of astronauts will be led by Ye Guangfu, a fighter pilot and veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye, along with Li Cong and Li Guangsu are scheduled to blast off at 8.59pm local time on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. They will relieve the Shenzhou-17 team who are currently on the Tiangong space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Jiuquan, Ye said the mission will be a special one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very special time and also carries special meaning. During the mission this time in China's space station, we will celebrate China's 75th anniversary of its founding and today is also China's ninth Space Day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye also stressed that China believes in international collaboration when it comes to space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us, we all actually pursue our dream to establish a space station, explore space, and also to make contributions. I believe we'll make great contributions to build a community of shared future for mankind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also sincerely invite our international peers to explore the vast universe together and to create a better future for mankind with joint efforts, and a China space station you can always look up to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tiangong is the crown jewel of Beijing's space programme – which has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon – and made China the third country to put humans in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new crew will replace the Shenzhou-17 team, who were sent to the station in October, and stay in orbit for six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhou-17 crew is scheduled to return to Earth on April 30. (Additional reporting by AFP and Xinhua)

    Legco expansion to be completed by year's end

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legco President Andrew Leung on Tuesday said the expanded Legislative Council Complex in Admiralty was expected to come into operation at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Four storeys are being added to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, several government officials, and Leung attended the "topping out" ceremony at Legco and visited the newly built 12th floor, marking a milestone in progress on the expansion of the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he hopes Legco members can move into the building by the end of the year so that they can work under the same roof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Wendy Hong, who is one of dozens of members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as their temporary office, said it would be more convenient when they moved back to Legco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look forward to move back soon because now we have meetings in the Legco building, but our office is in another building," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes it's difficult for us to arrange [meeting] times. When you have 20, 15 minutes in between two meetings, it's difficult for you to go back to the office and come back [to Legco] again. But now we can go back to office and come back. It's easier to arrange time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction of the new floors began in 2022, with the project costing around HK$400 million more than the original estimate, from HK$1.17 billion to HK$1.56 billion.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK readied on Tuesday to start detaining migrants within days for deportation to Rwanda after the controversial plan got parliament's approval, sparking outrage from the UN and rights groups.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new legislation – a flagship policy of the Conservative government that aims to curb irregular cross-Channel migration from northern France – cleared its final hurdle after a marathon late-night parliamentary tussle on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just hours later French police said at least five migrants, including a child, died overnight during an attempt to cross the busy shipping lane in a small boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the UK scheme, undocumented asylum seekers arriving in Britain would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be examined and, if approved, would allow them to stay in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says deportations are expected to begin within 10-12 weeks, with migrants identified for the first flight due to be detained and held from as early as this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rwanda said it was "pleased" to see the bill passed and was looking forward to "welcoming those relocated to Rwanda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the heads of the UN agencies for refugees and human rights warned it threatened the rule of law and set "a perilous precedent globally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged the UK to instead "take practical measures to address irregular flows of refugees and migrants, based on international cooperation and respect for international human rights law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Council of Europe also called for the new law to be scrapped and said it raised "major issues about the human rights of asylum seekers and the rule of law more generally." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.02 percent to 5,072 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10 percent, to 15,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, to 38,461.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are eyeing first quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March on Friday. Hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March had pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Boeing fell 2.8 percent after the planemaker reported its first quarterly revenue drop in seven quarters, even though the result beat analyst expectations.
  <br/>

  Solar inverter maker Enphase Energy dropped 5.5 percent after projecting second-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  The government said the two leaders also talked about promoting high-quality development in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Hong Kong and Shenzhen had set up various working groups to promote collaboration in key areas including the Northern Metropolis, and the innovation and technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, which is located in the Lok Ma Chau Loop, would start to operate soon.

    'Similar accident happened at Sha Tin manhole in 2006'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims says a similar fatal accident happened before in 2006." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750138_1_L_20240423125304.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A workers' rights group on Tuesday said it is angry about the manhole incident in which two workers died, noting that a similar accident happened at the same site before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said a pair of workers had died in 2006 after working in a manhole on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Construction Industry Employees General Union also said authorities failed to learn lessons from the previous accident, and called on them to review regulations and enforcement practices to get rid of any loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's chief executive Siu Sin-man said the Labour Department should ask construction companies to notify authorities before starting work in a manhole so inspections can take place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The system can effectively strengthen the contractors' vigilance because they need to provide many supporting [documents] to the Labour Department to show they have done the best preparations including safety precautions," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Labour Department knows more about the ongoing projects, there can be better monitoring."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body said the Drainage Services Department needs to ensure that contractors fully comply with safety standards by conducting risk assessments, installing ventilators and monitoring equipment in the manholes, as well as arranging safety harnesses for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it is trying to get in touch with the families of the workers to offer assistance.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kewell's Yokohama F-Marinos set up an Asian Champions League final showdown with Al Ain after beating Ulsan Hyundai 5-4 on penalties to win a pulsating semi-final on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trailing 1-0 from last week's first leg in South Korea, Yokohama scored three goals in the opening 30 minutes of the return fixture in Japan but then conceded twice and had a man sent off before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game finished 3-3 on aggregate after extra time in constant driving rain, before goalkeeper William Popp saved from Ulsan's Kim Min-woo in the shoot-out to hand Yokohama the advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carlos Eduardo converted the decisive spot-kick to send Yokohama, who former Liverpool and Leeds forward Kewell took over as coach at the start of the year, into their first Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ulsan, who had already booked their place in next year's 32-team Club World Cup in the United States by winning the semi-final first leg, were looking for their third Champions League title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama will host Al Ain in the first leg of the final on May 11, with the return being held in the United Arab Emirates on May 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ain beat Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 5-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to reach the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama made a blistering start and took the lead in the 13th minute when a defensive mix-up between Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Seok-ho allowed Asahi Uenaka to streak through and score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama looked capable of scoring more and it was little surprise when Anderson Lopes added a second in the 21st minute, firing home a left-foot shot from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home side kept up the pressure and Uenaka notched his second of the game on the half-hour mark when he slipped his marker and curled a shot past goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as it looked like turning into a rout, Ulsan hit back when Matheus Sales headed home direct from a corner in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later, Ulsan had a penalty and Yokohama were reduced to 10 men when Takumi Kamijima was red-carded for a handball as he slid in to make a tackle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Darijan Bojanic, who had come on in the 34th minute, made no mistake from the spot. (AFP)

    Wolves overpower Suns to lead 2-0, Pacers down Bucks

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaden McDaniels scored 25 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves dominated the Phoenix Suns 105-93 to take a 2-0 series lead in the NBA playoffs on Tuesday, while Indiana roared back to beat Milwaukee 125-108 and square their best-of-seven duel at 1-1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McDaniels led a balanced Minnesota offensive effort that saw all five starters finish in double digits as the Western Conference third seeds moved to within two wins of a series victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was the Timberwolves defence who turned the game in the home side's favor, shutting down Phoenix in the second half to frustrate Suns stars Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A torrid night for Phoenix ended with Booker fouling out in the fourth quarter while the Suns also were handed an injury scare, with Grayson Allen hobbling off in the third quarter after rolling an ankle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Suns coach Frank Vogel will have his work cut out for him when the series heads to Arizona for game three on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves will go into that fixture brimming with confidence after restricting Phoenix's offense to 42 second-half points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota scored 31 points off 20 Phoenix turnovers while the Suns took just two points from the Wolves' 14 turnovers throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Milwaukee, Pascal Siakam poured in 37 points to guide the Pacers to an impressive series-leveling win over the Bucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siakam finished with 11 rebounds and six assists while Myles Turner added 22 and Andrew Nembhard 20 as the Pacers claimed a deserved win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milwaukee started brightly, with Damian Lillard once again taking on the lion's share of the scoring duties in the absence of the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lillard's 34 points were not enough to keep the Pacers at arm's length. Indiana took the lead just before half-time and finally pulled away in the fourth quarter, leading by 23 points at one stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game three in the series takes place in Indianapolis on Friday. (AFP)

    First trial under UN anti-terrorism law gets underway

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court is hearing Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750185_1_L_20240423173240.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance got underway at the High Court on Tuesday, over an alleged attempt to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Lai Chun-pong and Justin Hui deny "conspiracy to commit bombing of prescribed objects", while Lau Pui-ying has pleaded not guilty to a conspiracy charge relating to providing or collecting property to commit terrorist acts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the court that the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019 – one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first bomb was designed to make police move to where the second was planted, the prosecution said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the second bomb was bigger, with a power radius of 400 metres, and it contained 150 iron nails which would have caused serious casualties and property damage had it been detonated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defendants also planned to shoot police officers, the court was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the nine-person jury that Cheung Ming-yu, Hui and Lai received military training in Taiwan in September 2019, and that the trio also went up a hill in Sai Kung to test their guns three weeks before the day of the planned attack, which police say they foiled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution's witnesses for the trial include a co-defendant who pleaded guilty, Wong Chun-keung, who is said to have been the leader of the group behind the alleged bomb plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong authorities have brought a prosecution using the anti-terrorism ordinance since it was enacted in July 2002.

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750299_1_L_20240424111040.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau clarified that shops could still use plastic containers to pack takeaway food, after a supermarket chain was found using paper food boxes to pack sushi, much to the irritation of some customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photo went viral online, showing Japanese discount retailer DON DON DONKI using non-plastic, non-transparent containers to pack sushi, with netizens describing that as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching out through its “Big Waster” social media account, the bureau said using plastic packaging was still ok for now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This situation is the same with takeaways, so supermarkets can still use plastic boxes and lids to pack takeout sushi. Of course, they can also use transparent boxes, so customers can clearly distinguish the food quality and types," it wrote on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

    Hongkong Post urged to boost e-commerce revenues

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hongkong Post says many unforeseen developments have impacted its ability to achieve the budgeted revenues. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750323_1_L_20240424130708.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday urged Hongkong Post to explore measures to boost its revenue in e-commerce services, after the postal department suffered losses from operations in seven of the past 10 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A report by the auditor noted that Hongkong Post also failed to meet the target rates of return on fixed assets for nine years in the past decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022-23, the postal department recorded a loss from operations of HK$305 million and a rate of return on fixed assets of negative 13 percent – far from the 1.5 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audit officials said local e-commerce services, which were intended to offset loss-making traditional mail services, did not perform well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that the profitability was negative each year throughout the previous five-year period with the deficit being around three-fold of the revenue each year, while Hongkong Post could not attain the budgeted revenue from local e-commerce services for each of the three years in the period from 2020-21 to 2022-23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Hongkong Post] needs to continue efforts in increasing the revenue and the mail volume of local e-commerce services, and explore effective measures to improve the profitability of local e-commerce services," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor cites Hongkong Post as saying it sets an aggressive target for budgeted revenues to motivate staff to maximise revenue generation. However, in the ever-changing business environment, there are many unforeseen developments, especially during the Covid-19 epidemic, which significantly impacted on [Hongkong Post's] ability to achieve the budgeted revenues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor also conducted a check on Hongkong Post's website and found that cross-border postal services for regions in mainland China were incorrectly listed as "international services".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The postal department has since revised such descriptions to "other destinations", according to the commission's report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate examination by the commission showed that service agreements between Hongkong Post and stamp designers lacked specific clauses concerning safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Postmaster General said Hongkong Post attaches great importance to national security and will incorporate such clauses.

 The Transport Department said some high-speed rail services to and from the mainland were cancelled on Thursday due to bad weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains G6527, G6515, G6529, G6535, G6528, G6516, G6530 and G6536 to Guangzhounan (Guangzhou South) were cancelled.

  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the destination of train G6510 and the departure station for train G6511 were changed to Shenzhenbei (Shenzhen North) instead of Guangzhounan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said people could consider using alternative transport to get to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Meteorological Centre said it expects heavy rain to continue to hit Guangdong.

    Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Wednesday called on the government to improve labour protection, boost benefits for public servants and increase the city's minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nine labour and civil service unions issued a "Labour Day Declaration" ahead of May 1, with 10 policy suggestions, including an end to further labour imports and improving occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, Lee Kwok-keung, said the city’s minimum hourly wage should be increased by HK$15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While our proposed increase from HK$40 an hour to HK$55 seems substantial, we should bear in mind the fact that a basic lunch can easily cost HK$55. If the minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost of a meal, it's not really reasonable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, meanwhile, noted a recent 0.1 percentage point increase in Hong Kong's unemployment rate, meaning an extra 9,400 people – 111,700 in total – were out of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, urged the government to provide a job-matching service for businesses participating in labour importation schemes, with the aim of getting them to prioritise local people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federation of HKSAR Civil Servants, Lee Fong-chung, said there is a need for the government to come up with policies to address staff shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the annual retirement rate for senior government positions has hit 10 percent and there has been a "huge" number of resignations in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think it's very important for the government to refill the vacancies as soon as possible, through regular recruitment or transferring some contract [workers] onto permanent terms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the number of government workers in their 20s and 30s resigning has been particularly high and more family-friendly policies are needed to keep hold of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Like [increasing] maternity leave… And also, the government may amend some policy on the long-term investment for the civil servants, like they can use a portion of their pension fund for them to buy a house or to buy medical insurance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Government Employees Association, Cheung Hoi-wing, added that many civil servants have chosen to retire in mainland cities in recent years and the government should extend civil servant healthcare benefits to cover the whole Greater Bay Area.

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the authorities are ready for an influx of visitors during the mainland's Golden Week holiday next month, with preparations in place at immigration control points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said almost six million people are expected to enter or leave Hong Kong via the airport, rail and land crossings in the first week of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said special arrangements have been put in place for particularly busy periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The TLB (Transport and Logistics Bureau) and the Transport Department have already been in close contact with the transportation operators, so we'll be in full gear to ensure that there will be good and smooth service for visitors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll also be turning out officers to take care of the management of tourist groups because we want to spread them out, also to stagger the meal arrangement, so that they will be smoothly absorbed into the whole arrangement at different districts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Golden Week will be a good opportunity to show people that Hong Kong is a vibrant city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want the experiences of the visitors, that of course includes tourists and also maybe a result of the activities of local spenders, to have a good experience, both in taking meals, in shopping, in all kinds of services, businesses," he said.

    Heat stun Celtics to level playoff series

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat unleashed a barrage of three-pointers to score a series-levelling 111-101 upset over the top-seeded Boston Celtics in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff duel on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eighth seeds Miami, playing without the injured Jimmy Butler, produced a battling performance to knot the best-of-seven-series at 1-1 as the teams head back to Florida for game three on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyler Herro led the Miami scoring with 24 points, part of a balanced offensive effort that saw all five Heat starters post double-digit points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the key to the Miami victory was their accuracy from long-range, with the Heat draining 23 three-pointers from 43 attempts compared to Boston's 12 of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Herro knocked down six threes while Caleb Martin added five in his tally of 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston, meanwhile, was led by 33 points from Jaylen Brown, with Jayson Tatum finishing with 28 in a losing effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was all the more unexpected given Miami's 20-point drubbing by Boston in game one on Sunday – something Herro said had motivated the Heat for game two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We lost badly in game one and everybody responded tonight, and that's that's all you can ask for from a group of guys," Herro said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another trademark display of defiance from Miami, who are aiming to emulate their playoff run of last season when they reached the NBA Finals after entering the postseason via the play-in tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't even want to mention last year, this year is a whole new year," Herro said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We feel like we have a great group of guys. We're not fully healthy, but we have guys who want to play and want to be out here making a difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This playoff opportunity is big for everybody. We just love to compete." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they are looking into a video showing a man jumping from platform to platform at an MTR station.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage circulating online appears to have been taken by the man himself as he leapt over the train track at Fo Tan Station on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR Corporation called in the police on Monday night after reviewing its CCTV footage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said the two platforms involved are more than two metres apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the man carrying out the stunt appears to be between 20 and 30 years old, while CCTV suggests another man of around the same age also filmed what happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the case has been classified as a breach of MTR by-laws. No arrests have been made.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations called on Tuesday for an international investigation into reports of mass graves at two Gaza hospitals destroyed in Israeli sieges, saying war crimes might have been committed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it was "horrified" by the destruction of Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, and its second largest, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday that health workers had uncovered nearly 340 bodies, updating an earlier figure, of Palestinians allegedly killed and buried by Israeli forces at the Nasser complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army dismissed claims that its troops had buried bodies during its operation at Nasser as "baseless and unfounded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office demanded "independent, effective and transparent investigations into the deaths."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals, which are protected under international law, have repeatedly come under Israeli bombardment over more than six months of war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted during its attack inside Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has denied the claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law," Turk said. "And the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat is a war crime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it did not have access to independent information as to what happened at the two hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said efforts were under way to corroborate reports and details given by Gazan authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victims had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste," she told reporters in Geneva, adding that older people, women and wounded were reportedly among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were allegedly "found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes." (AFP)

    Initial response to plastic tableware ban positive: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the initial response to a ban on plastic tableware has been positive, adding the government would monitor the supply and price of alternative products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking a day after the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect, Lee said it takes time for people's behaviour to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are aware that these alternatives cost about several cents or 20 cents or so. So they are affordable. I do believe that they will not be too costly in the operation of businesses," he told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is an international trend to move away from plastic. Alternative products have been developed over quite some time. We have just started the regulation of plastic tableware. We do hope that Hong Kong people will understand that it is our responsibility to protect the environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added the Environmental Protection Department had provided a list of around 700 suitable non-plastic alternatives for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the ban prohibits the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

    First Ukraine aid to arrive in hours: Biden

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as US$1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)

    Trump jury gets master class on burying negative press

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker told the NY court how he would suppress negative stories about Donald Trump. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750251_1_L_20240424035636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A colourful former tabloid publisher took the witness stand on Tuesday at Donald Trump's "hush money" trial and described how he suppressed negative stories about the real estate tycoon, a practice known as "catch and kill."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors allege that Trump engaged in "election fraud" by having his then personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to the adult film actress on the eve of the 2016 election in which he defeated Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, former publisher of the National Enquirer, was the first witness called to testify by prosecutors at Trump's high-stakes trial, which comes less than seven months ahead of his expected rematch against President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors are seeking with Pecker's testimony to demonstrate that the "catch and kill" scheme of squashing negative stories was one commonly used by Trump and Cohen, the once loyal "fixer" who has since turned against his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker took the stand after a nearly 90-minute hearing during which Judge Juan Merchan was asked by prosecutors to hold Trump in contempt of court for violating a partial gag order preventing him from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors or court staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan heard arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys but did not issue an immediate ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he has known Trump since 1989 and described him as a friend – "I would call him Donald."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said National Enquirer readers "loved" Trump, who starred in the hit reality television series "The Apprentice" before going into politics in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he agreed at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower with Trump, Cohen and Trump's personal assistant Hope Hicks to help his friend's nascent campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said what I would do is, I would run or publish positive stories about Mr Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he would also warn Cohen about potential negative stories about Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I notified Michael Cohen of a story that was a negative story, he would try to vet it himself, see if the story was true or not," Pecker said. "And he would go to the individual publication to make sure the story wasn't published and get it killed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors walked Pecker through two payments made to squash negative stories. One involved a Trump Tower doorman who was peddling a false claim that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other involved a former Playboy magazine model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with the married Trump. She was paid US$150,000 not to go public with the story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker is to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Pecker testified, prosecutors – at a hearing held without the jury present – accused Trump of brazenly violating the gag order imposed by the judge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's "willful" attacks on witnesses "clearly violate" the gag order, prosecutor Chris Conroy said, urging the judge to fine him US$1,000 per violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty," Conroy said, but the court should "remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Cohen are both expected to appear as prosecution witnesses at the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Truth Social, calling them, for example, "sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lashed out at the judge following the day's proceedings, calling the gag order "unconstitutional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not allowed to talk but people are allowed to talk about me," he said. "They can lie but I'm not allowed to say anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained that Biden is "out campaigning and I'm here in the courtroom."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very unfair situation." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in China for a three-day visit as the two countries try to keep relations on an even keel amid differences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken landed in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon where he will meet students and business leaders. He'll later head to Beijing and hold talks with top Chinese officials there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides are expected to discuss issues such as Ukraine, regional peace and stability, and fentanyl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Blinken's second visit to China in less than a year, following up on recent phone talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency noted that bilateral ties have begun to stabilise since the two leaders met in San Francisco last November, with significant exchanges in various fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains committed to open dialogue and communication with the United States. However, Washington must recognise that dialogue must be based on equality and respect, and actions must align with words," Xinhua said. (Agencies)

    London's FTSE strikes record as global sentiment lifts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's FTSE 100 stocks index hit record highs on Tuesday, catching up with major global peers that have struck all-time peaks this year as inflation cools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sentiment was upbeat across major world indices thanks to easing Middle East worries and hopes of interest-rate cuts, while traders are keenly awaiting the release this week of more major earnings and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's FTSE 100 reached 8,076 points shortly after the open, surpassing a record 8,047 struck in February last year, though it pared down gains in afternoon deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good news as this is, it does highlight the sluggishness of the UK's top equity index when compared to its US and European competitors which hit a string of successive records throughout the first quarter of 2024," said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he added, "let's not be too churlish as it could be we see the FTSE outperform its rivals in the years to come should investors seek out dividend paying value stocks rather than techy growthy ones."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the dollar, as markets anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the coming months thanks to slowing price rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A weaker pound benefits FTSE-listed British multinationals that make big earnings in foreign currencies. Sterling gained against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after falling earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets won a lift from news of an improvement to business activity in the eurozone this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street opened higher on a busy week on the corporate front, with investors keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings from Elon Musk's Tesla later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker, which enjoyed scorching growth for most of 2022 and 2023, has experienced setbacks that analysts say have raised the stakes for the first-quarter report. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.

 The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it strongly opposed and disapproved of a report by the United States on the human rights situation in Hong Kong last year, calling it "unfounded and biased".
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman of the SAR government said it condemned repeated US attempts to politicise human rights in the so-called annual human rights report by the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR government strongly demands that the US immediately stop acting against the international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs," the spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration is against the wanton slander on Hong Kong where the One Country, Two Systems principle is successfully implemented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that the SAR's laws on national security clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) said new ways to increase economic productivity could help retain the SAR's status as a supply chain hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “New quality productive forces” — a concept introduced by President Xi Jinping and highlighted in Premier Li Qiang’s work report — refer to productivity increases helped by breakthroughs in technology, rather than in traditional industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, the council's executive director, Mohamed Butt, said new quality productive forces, also known as NPF, could help attract more businesses to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This NPF can empower the growth of new industrialisation, as well as enhance our capability to become a stronger base for exports. I think in the budget speech, the Secretary for Finance mentioned that Hong Kong needs to become an international supply chain hub," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In conclusion, I think NPF can really bring in new people, new ideas, new businesses, and enhance our capability to become a stronger base for supply chain hub for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of HKPC and lawmaker, Sunny Tan, said new quality productive forces could enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about being innovative, being able to apply new technologies in industrial development and the product development side with new products, new materials, new production processes, and also new ways of distribution," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, productive forces, really, it's about getting all stages, doing it right with, again, innovation and technology to enhance our competitiveness along the entire supply chain."

    China slams US military aid package to Taiwan

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has condemned the latest package of US military assistance to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Senate on Tuesday passed US$95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package included US$8 billion for the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid seriously violates US commitments to China and sends a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affair and does not tolerate any external interference," spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said US military support for the island only increased the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to emphasise that the United States and Taiwan strengthening military ties will not bring about security for Taiwan," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will only increase tensions and the risk of conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and will ultimately be an act of shooting oneself in the foot." (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New York Knicks scored eight points in the final 27.4 seconds to stun the Philadelphia 76ers 104-101 on Monday and take a 2-0 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson's three-pointer pulled the Knicks within two points and after Josh Hart came up with a steal, Donte DiVincenzo capped a chaotic possession with a three-pointer – after missing his first attempt – to put New York up 102-101.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OG Anunoby sealed it at an ecstatic Madison Square Garden with a pair of free throws as the Knicks joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in taking a 2-0 lead in their first-round series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs led wire-to-wire in a 96-86 victory over the Orlando Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crushing defeat for the 76ers, who didn't trail until late in the third quarter, when a Brunson layup gave the Knicks a 68-67 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Philadelphia's NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid was clearly hindered late by pain in his surgically repaired left knee, but the Sixers appeared to have regained control when Tyrese Maxey, fed by Embiid, made a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that put the Sixers up 100-96.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyle Lowry added a free throw to give the Sixers a five-point lead with less than a minute to play, but the Knicks responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 24 points despite connecting on just eight of 29 shots from the field. He added eight rebounds and six assists and Hart added 21 points and 15 rebounds for New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maxey, who skipped the Sixers' morning shoot-around because of illness, finished with 35 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. Embiid added 34 points and 10 rebounds but missed a three-pointer at the final buzzer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Cleveland, Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points and Jarrett Allen added 16 points and 20 rebounds for the Cavaliers in another dominant win over the Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, eager to expunge the memory of their first-round loss to the Knicks last season, have posted two straight wire-to-wire victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolo Banchero led Orlando's scoring with 21 points and Franz Wagner added 18. The youthful Magic will be hoping to turn things around when the series shifts to Orlando. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say the driver of a school bus died after he accidentally fell from the vehicle, which then rolled over him in Diamond Hill on Wednesday, while in a separate incident a driver was killed in Lau Fau Shan when his truck slid down a slope, trapping him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 47-year-old bus driver was preparing to leave the car park of a housing estate on Hammer Hill Road not long after 4pm when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man suffered multiple injuries but was conscious when he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He later lost consciousness  where he was declared dead just after 9.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 6.30pm, police were called to Lau Fau Shan to reports that a man was trapped between a medium-sized truck and some water tanks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers say that initial investigations show that the man had parked the truck, which was linked to a container trailer and the water tanks, on a slope near Fung Kong Tsuen Road. After he got out, police believe the truck rolled backwards, leaving him trapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were able to release the 67-year-old driver but he was declared dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kowloon East police are looking into the Diamond Hill incident while officers in New Territories North are checking on the Lau Fau Shan case.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kai Havertz celebrates scoring his first and Arsenal's third goal of the night.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Havertz and Ben White scored twice as Arsenal thrashed Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday to surge ahead in the Premier League title race and up the pressure on Liverpool and Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The destiny of the title remains in City's hands as the defending champions have two games in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have also played one fewer game than Arsenal and are in action at Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men's goal difference advantage now looks unassailable should it become decisive in the title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts flew out of the blocks and were in front inside five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard smashed in his 15th goal of the season at Djordje Petrovic's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Petrovic redeemed himself for fault at the opening goal with two brilliant saves to turn away Havertz's low effort and a deflected shot by Trossard to keep his side in the game before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the floodgates opened once White curled in Arsenal's second after Chelsea failed to clear a corner on 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Odegaard's stunning through ball was then met with the finish it deserved as Havertz smashed high past Petrovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next finish was more subtle as the German international fired in off the post from Bukayo Saka's pass for his seventh goal in his last 14 club games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A night for forget for Chelsea was summed up by a sitter from Nicolas Jackson when he hit the side-netting with just David Raya to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And fortune was also not on Mauricio Pochettino's side when White's attempted cross flew into the top corner from another sensational Odegaard pass. (AFP)

    Emergency appointments halved amid dentist shortage
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of emergency dental appointment slots at government clinics has fallen by almost half since the pandemic, the Audit Commission said on Wednesday, as it called for improvements to services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a report, the government auditor said there was an annual quota of around 40,000 appointment slots at the city’s 11 public dental clinics in the year 2018/19, but this had fallen to about 20,000 by 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It cited the Department of Health as saying the reduction was due to the pandemic, but also a shortage of dentists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said it found instances of people queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment the following day under the first-come-first served system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one clinic, people who had pre-registered to see the dentist still had to arrive in the morning to pick up a disc for an appointment that wasn’t until the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor noted that the government is aware of the public demand for more appointment slots for emergency dental care and urged it to address the manpower shortage and bring the quota back up to at least the level before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the public spending watchdog said health officials should beef up support for NGOs involved in the Outreach Dental Care Programme, which provides free dental services to elderly people in care homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the attendance rate for the programme needs to be improved, noting that the target of 43,000 service users was not met from 2020/21 to 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two NGOs served less than half the number of people they aimed to for three consecutive years, the auditor added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that officials plan to look into the feasibility of expanding a mental health support hotline to other platforms, such as instant messaging apps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 18111 hotline which launched last December has been receiving around 350 calls per day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said those seeking help wanted to talk about issues such as mental distress, family relationships, physical health problems and work pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the hotline operators have referred around 200 people to different organisations for support, and two urgent cases to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said officials have been regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the service and it could be expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the outcome of the review of the operation, we will consider the feasibility of extending the service to other platforms (such as instant messaging software) in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Mental Health in due course," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials plan to ask an independent organisation to conduct a full service evaluation study in the third quarter of the year, to collect views from NGOs and other stakeholders through questionnaires and focus groups.

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    HK's inflation rate up slightly at two percent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation rate slightly rose in March, with the Composite Consumer Price Index up two percent on a year earlier.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compared to the 1.9 percent inflation rate in the previous two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department showed that underlying inflation, stripping out short-term relief measures, was also up marginally in March, at one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcohol and tobacco prices surged nearly 18 percent year-on-year, while meals out and takeaways were up 3.3 percent and housing costs rose 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electricity, gas and water prices dropped 8.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the underlying price inflation was “modest” in March, noting that prices of basic foods edged down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay contained in the near term. Domestic costs may face some upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad downward trend, though heightened geopolitical tensions will bring uncertainties,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first quarter of 2024, overall consumer prices rose 1.9 percent year-on-year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China condemned on Tuesday what it called "groundless accusations" by the United States that Beijing is supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The United States has unveiled a large-scale aid bill for Ukraine while also making groundless accusations against normal trade between China and Russia," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This kind of approach is extremely hypocritical and utterly irresponsible, and China is firmly opposed to it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang reiterated that China has consistently maintained that it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the Ukraine issue, China has always maintained an objective and just position, advocated actively for peace talks and pushed for a political resolution," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Beijing will not accept others "passing the buck" or shifting the blame. (AFP)

    'Precautions also apply to sites near manholes'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A construction union group's safety adviser says people working near manholes can also be exposed to a high concentration of gas. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750303_1_L_20240424112457.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Safety measures for working in confined spaces also apply to sites connected to manholes, a construction group said on Wednesday, following the deaths this week of two sewer maintenance workers who were suspected to have been exposed to toxic gas in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the pair, who are thought to have inhaled hydrogen sulfide, were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee Kwong-sing, a safety adviser with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said people working near a manhole could also be exposed to a high concentration of gas when the cover is opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [hazardous] gas is concentrated enough, people near the manhole may have a chance of inhaling a high concentration of toxic gas... and possibly faint and fall into the manhole," Lee told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said current regulations stipulate that precautions are required for people working in a confined space and also in the vicinity of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, workers were using high-pressure water jets near the manhole," Lee said. "So one can't say because workers are not going into the manhole, there is no need for precautionary measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing said the government needs to tighten up guidelines for people working in confined spaces, including more stringent tests on hazardous gases and mandatory video monitoring of workers inside manholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Tuesday evening said a revised code on working in confined spaces would be ready in one to two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, agreed with suggestions that construction companies should notify authorities before work starts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those small-scale construction works, related to high-risk tasks such as [working in] confined spaces and manholes, you also need to report and notify the Labour Department," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, contractors are not required to submit project reports to labour officials in advance if such work will involve at most 10 workers and will be completed within six weeks.
