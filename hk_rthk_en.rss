    Canada wildfire doubles in size as thousands flee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Residents of Fort McMurray head away from their fire-threatened homes. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753344_1_20240516093213.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A wildfire in Canada's major oil-producing region doubled in size as it drew closer to the city of Fort McMurray on Wednesday, but officials were hopeful shifting winds could soon push it away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The blaze scorched almost 21,000 hectares of forest overnight as it came within 4.5 kilometres of the city, which was partly evacuated the day before.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alberta Wildfire spokeswoman Christie Tucker told a briefing that cooler temperatures and calmer winds were expected to "push the fire away from Fort McMurray" as well as weaken it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis urged residents to "remain vigilant," noting that "wildfire conditions can change and deteriorate rapidly."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For many, the fire has brought back terrifying memories of 2016 when a massive blaze gutted Fort McMurray, forcing its entire population of more than 90,000 to flee at a moment's notice.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm sure these memories will create fear and uncertainty for many in Fort McMurray and my sympathy is with everyone facing this situation, but safety must remain our top priority," said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, after 6,000 residents of four neighborhoods were ordered out on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many stores and schools were closed as a haze blanketed the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Freddy Saulnier, 51, who recently moved to Fort McMurray from New Brunswick on the Atlantic coast, says he is living "a nightmare."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Staying in a hotel room after being ordered to leave his home, he says he can smell the smoke. This fire "is a beast," he said. "It's almost like watching a horror movie, you don't know if the killer is hiding behind a tree, and it's eerily quiet at night."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After being pulled from the front lines the day before, firefighters were back on Wednesday along with water bombers dropping retardant, while heavy equipment operators built fire guards southwest of the town.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Canadian authorities have been bracing for another possibly devastating wildfire season, after the country's worst-ever last year saw flames burning from coast to coast and charring more than 15 million hectares of land. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United kept alive their hopes of salvaging a dismal season by qualifying for Europe as Amad Diallo's rocket inspired a 3-2 win against Newcastle on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Erik ten Hag's side are battling to secure a seventh place finish in the Premier League, which could secure a place in next season's UEFA Conference League.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United will qualify for the Europa League if they win the FA Cup final against Manchester City on May 25.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But if City triumph at Wembley then seventh will be enough for a Conference League spot.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And eighth-placed United are still in the hunt for that place after beating Newcastle to move level on points with the seventh-placed Magpies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Goals from Kobbie Mainoo, Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford gave United only their third win in nine league games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, United's goal difference is vastly inferior to Newcastle's, meaning they must better the Magpies' result in the last game of the season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United travel to Brighton on Sunday, while Newcastle head to Brentford.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Newcastle's defeat means fifth-placed Tottenham are guaranteed to be in the Europa League next season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sixth placed Chelsea won 2-1 at Brighton in Wednesday's other game to move closer to European qualification after a turbulent campaign.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead with the 22nd league goal of his superb season in the 34th minute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Christopher Nkunku doubled Chelsea's advantage in the 64th minute with his third league goal of an injury-plagued first season with the club.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mauricio Pochettino's side host Bournemouth on Sunday knowing a draw will be enough to earn a European berth, with fifth place still in play if they win and Tottenham lose at Sheffield United. (AFP)

    Zverev beats injury scare to reach Rome semis

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alexander Zverev celebrates his quarter final win. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753332_1_20240516080755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alexander Zverev reached his 18th Masters semi-final in Rome on Wednesday but only after a worrying fall which sparked memories of the horror injury he suffered at the French Open two years ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The world number five from Germany defeated Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 to set up a last-four duel with Alejandro Tabilo, the Chilean journeyman who had stunned Novak Djokovic earlier in the tournament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zverev's moment of concern came in just the third game on centre court at the Foro Italico when he fell on the clay and landed on his front.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 2017 champion cut his left wrist and a finger in the tumble and required treatment from the tournament physio before he continued the match.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zverev, 27, suffered a serious ankle injury at the 2022 French Open after falling on the clay of Roland Garros during his semi-final against Rafael Nadal and missed the rest of the season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Wednesday, however, he was able to dust himself down to defeat Fritz in 90 minutes, firing 20 winners with six aces and not facing a single break point.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chile's Tabilo will play his first-ever Masters 1000 semi-final at the age of 26, after seeing off unseeded Zhang Zhizhen of China 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 26 minutes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Women's second seed Aryna Sabalenka needed just an hour and 13 minutes to see off Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-4 on her way to the semis, improving her record against her Latvian opponent to three wins and no defeats.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sabalenka will next take on Miami Open winner Danielle Collins who eased past Victoria Azarenka 6-4, 6-3.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 26-year-old could get a rematch of the Madrid final which she lost in dramatic fashion to world number one Iga Swiatek earlier this month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rome is the first time since the 2013 French Open that the top three women have reached the last four of a WTA event of 250 level or higher, with Swiatek and world number three Coco Gauff in the other semi-final on Thursday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday after data showed a moderation in US consumer prices in April, boosting the chances for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All three major indices rocketed to fresh all-time highs after monthly US consumer prices came in slightly below expectations, with annual inflation at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage points from March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones gained 0.9 percent to 39,908, putting it back within striking distance of a first-ever close above 40,000 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 jumped 1.2 percent to 5,308, while the Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent to 16,742, notching a second straight record.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Retail sales were flat in April, missing estimates for a 0.4 percent increase.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The reports together "point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US stocks rallied in the first quarter on expectations for interest rate cuts, but hit obstacles later in the spring as Fed officials pushed back the timeframe for easing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Dell surged 11.2 percent after Morgan Stanley analysts lifted their price target on the technology company, highlighting its artificial intelligence offerings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Boeing slumped 2.1 percent after the Department of Justice said the company had breached a 2021 criminal settlement, potentially leading to criminal prosecution.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 GameStop and AMC Entertainment tumbled following two days of gains that prompted talk of a revived "meme stock" craze. GameStop dropped 18.9 percent, while AMC lost 20 percent. (AFP)

    English Premier League clubs to vote on scrapping VAR

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The EPL's controversial VAR system could be shown the red card in June. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753314_1_20240516022914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs will be given the chance to scrap VAR from next season when they vote on the controversial review system at their annual general meeting next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wolves have submitted a resolution to abolish VAR to the Premier League, triggering a vote of the top flight's 20 teams on June 6.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Molineux club said VAR is "undermining the value of the Premier League brand" after another season marred by a host of debatable decisions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In order for VAR to be axed by the Premier League, 14 of the 20 clubs will have to vote against it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wolves are expected to canvas other clubs in order to gain support before the meeting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 VAR was introduced in the Premier League in 2019 with the aim of helping referees avoid clear and obvious errors that had marred matches in the past.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But there have been numerous controversies surrounding the technology this season as Premier League managers and fans grow increasingly vocal in their disdain for the system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart," a Wolves statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wolves boss Gary O'Neil revealed he has regularly received apologetic phone calls from Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) chief Howard Webb after VAR decisions that went against his team.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The impact of VAR on goal celebrations, the length of time taken for checks and a lack of communication in the stadium are all issues that have irked supporters and cited by Wolves as reasons for scrapping the system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, the Premier League believes VAR is still a valuable tool.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The English top flight, which is in regular dialogue with referees' governing body PGMOL, believes the number of incorrect decisions would increase without VAR which could damage the competition's reputation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the Annual General Meeting next month," a Premier League spokesperson said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at Shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "However, the League fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL, to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The final of the Cheung Chau "Bun Scrambling" competition was held on Wednesday night at 12 midnight on the football pitch of the Pak Tai Temple Recreation Ground in Cheung Chau, rounding off a day of festivities attended by tens of thousands of people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Firefighter Yip Kin-man was crowned "Bun King" and nurse Kung Tsz-shan won the title of "Bun Queen."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nine male and three female finalists competed at the same time, clambering up a 14-metre-high mountain covered in 9,000 plastic buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They had to fill their own bags with buns totalling the most points within the time limit of 3 minutes, to win the coveted titles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kwok Ka Ming, a regular contestant and one of the favourites for the men's title, won the “Full Pocket of Lucky Buns” prize for snatching the most buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cheung Chau Bun Festival originated as a ritual for people to pray for safety from a plague.

    Biden, Trump to hold first presidential debate in June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CNN will host the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753306_1_20240516001511.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to hold a first presidential debate in June after the Democratic incumbent challenged his rival to "make my day" and the scandal-plagued Republican quickly responded he was ready to "rumble."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CNN announced it will hold the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Biden proposed a second debate for September and Trump accepted.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden, 81, had set out his own terms for the debates with political showman Trump, such as time limits for speakers and having no live audience – a condition CNN said it had agreed to.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In his first formal debate offer after months of stalling, the Democrat also shunned the traditional calendar proposed by the commission that has run debates since 1988 as he sought to exercise control over the format.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump, 77, accepted the dates even as he set out a starkly different vision with a larger venue for "excitement purposes" and accused the Democrat of being afraid of crowds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal," Biden said in a video on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'll even do it twice."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden also trolled Trump over his ongoing criminal hush money trial in New York, which features a mid-week break, adding: "So let's pick the dates Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CNN said in a statement that the debate would be held at its studios in Atlanta in the "crucial battleground state of Georgia."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "To ensure candidates may maximise the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present. Moderators for the debate and additional details will be announced at a later date," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden's debate offer appeared to show him taking the calculated risk of putting Trump back into American living rooms ahead of November's election, hoping it could reverse the Republican's poll lead in a series of battleground states.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden campaign has increasingly been trying to remind voters of what they say is the true face of the mercurial president who lost in 2020, amid what they fear is Trump "nostalgia" in some quarters – even as the Republican details his stark vision for an authoritarian second term in various interviews.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For his part, Trump has previously said he would debate his rival "anytime, anywhere" as he seeks to portray Biden as old and incapable of leadership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After Biden's challenge, Trump – who avoided any debates with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination this year – said he was "ready to Rumble!!!" for the proposed June and September debates. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia Prime Minister Robert Fico was on Wednesday shot multiple times and rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries after a cabinet meeting, officials said, in an attack condemned by EU chiefs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico, a populist leader accused of being Kremlin-friendly, has been prime minister since last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Today, after the government meeting in Handlova, there was an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Robert Fico," the government said in a post on social media.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He is currently being transported by helicopter to Banska Bystrica in a life-threatening condition, because it would take too long to get to Bratislava due to the necessity of an acute intervention," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico was shot multiple times, said a post on his official Facebook page.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We confirm the attack on the prime minister," police spokesman Matej Neumann said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Handlova local hospital director Marta Eckhardtova said "Fico was brought into our hospital and he was treated at our vascular surgery clinic."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was unable to describe his injuries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dennik N daily said its reporter heard several shots fired and then saw security guards lift the premier off the ground and into a car.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The newspaper also reported that police had detained the suspected gunman.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slovak President Zuzana Caputova said she was "utterly shocked by today's brutal and reckless attack on Slovakia's prime minister... which I condemn in (the) strongest possible terms."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I wish him a lot of strength in this critical moment and early recovery," she said on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also called the news of the attack "shocking."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I hope the prime minister will get well as soon as possible. We must not tolerate violence, it must have no place in society," he said on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: "Robert, my thoughts are with you in this very difficult moment."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As well as his current stint as premier, Fico also headed the government in 2006-10 and 2012-18.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since he was elected last October, Fico has made a string of remarks that have soured ties between Slovakia and neighbouring Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He has notably questioned Ukraine's sovereignty and called for a compromise with Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also sparked mass protests with controversial changes, including a media law that critics say will undermine the impartiality of public television and radio.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a press conference following the shooting, MP Lubos Blaha from Fico's Smer party lashed out against his critics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "You, the liberal media, and progressive politicians are to blame. Robert Fico is fighting for his life because of your hatred," Blaha said. (AFP)

    US consumer inflation eases slightly to 3.4 percent

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The CPI data helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates in a bid to bring inflation back down to its long-term target of two percent. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753296_1_20240515214858.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US consumer inflation eased slightly last month, according to US government data published on Wednesday, a positive sign for President Joe Biden ahead of November's election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The data supports the Biden administration's messaging that the US economy has turned a corner, as it looks to quell consumers' concerns about the impact of rising prices going into the likely rematch against former president Donald Trump.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage point from March, the US Labour Department said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monthly inflation came in at 0.3 percent, slightly below expectations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CPI data also helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates to their highest level for 23 years in a bid to bring inflation back down firmly to its long-term target of two percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It marks the first month of slowing annual data since January, although both the annual and monthly figures remain too high.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline," the Labour Department said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items," it added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A widely-watched inflation measure excluding volatile food and energy prices also eased last month, rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down from 3.8 percent in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The so-called "core" inflation index rose 0.3 percent in April from a month earlier, according to the Labour Department, also slightly lower than in March. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former SAR football internationals Lam Ka-wai and Lo Kwan-yee received the perfect send-offs before their retirement as they led Hong Kong Rangers to a 1-0 victory against Kitchee in the Sapling Cup final on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rangers still have a game to go in the Premier League season, but the veterans decided to make the cup final at Mong Kok Stadium their last game before hanging up their boots.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Midfielder Lam, a traditional number ten, captained underdogs Rangers, who took the lead late in the first half when striker Nassam Ibrahim scored a header from close range.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Defender Lo, 39, came on as a substitute in the second half to fortify Rangers’ defence, which stubbornly turned away the Kitchee advances for a magical victory.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After the game, Lam, 38, thanked both Rangers and Kitchee, a club he also spent more than a decade with, for giving him the opportunities as a player.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The playmaker said he was particularly grateful to his mother club Rangers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “After Covid, I was a jobless footballer for a period of time. They quickly called me and asked me to join the team,” Lam said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lo, for his part, said jokingly he’s upset that Lam didn’t thank him. But he wanted to thank his teammate anyway, saying they’ve gone through so much together in their careers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam was capped 51 times by Hong Kong, China, scoring nine goals. Lo also found the net nine times during the 53 games he represented the SAR.

    'HK, Singapore to keep complementary roles'

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753267_1_20240515163949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Singapore will maintain their ties as both “complementors” and “competitors” as they navigate their way through an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, a veteran businessman with cross-market experience in both places said on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The remarks came as the Lion City ushered in a new era, with finance minister Lawrence Wong becoming the city-state’s first new prime minister in 20 years, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong who becomes senior minister of the cabinet.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think it's very positive,” said Dennis Chiu, chairman of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association (HSBA).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “He [Wong] really reflects the meritocracy system of Singapore, because he came from the very bottom of the ladder and then worked his way all up. He is very much a student of the Singapore system to show that.. in Singapore, anybody has a chance to reach the very top,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When asked how the new leadership might impact the business ties between the Lion City and the SAR, Chiu, who is also the executive director of Far East Consortium International and has straddled Hong Kong and Singapore for three decades, said he expects there will be “continuity” in terms of trade and business cooperation between the two places.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Singapore and Hong Kong have always played a complementary and competing role. And when you compete, you actually pick up good points from the other, so I think we are mutually learning from each other, but we also compete for the same dollar of investments,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I really don’t see there will be huge changes, but I think we will perhaps see how changes in the world will affect Hong Kong and Singapore,” he added, warning that geopolitics has become the most challenging factor affecting all economies, especially open economies like the two cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “You have to be neutral and to not choose a side,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The real estate veteran also said Hong Kong and Singapore could continue to cooperate in areas such as technology and digitisation, adoption of artificial intelligence, and green transition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Hong Kong, frankly speaking, has the huge market of China and the Greater Bay Area, [but] Singapore has Southeast Asia as its very important market. Those will always be the strengths of both of the cities’ finances,” Chiu added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think he [Wong] will be able to continue to carry on Lee's systems with him, we do not expect any new changes for the time being, but we want to see how he will be tested when new issues, such as Covid and international crises, come up,” he said. "This is something we all do not know."

    'Fare rise gives cabbies few thousand more a month'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 A taxi trade representative on Wednesday said cabbies are expected to earn thousands of dollars more every month when fares go up, but the sector is experiencing high operating costs and a change in passenger habits.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From July 14, there will be a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ng Kwan-shing of the Taxi Dealers & Owners Association said he believes the fare rises will mean cab drivers will earn around HK$100 extra for each shift, or an additional several thousand every month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he told an RTHK programme that both insurance and car maintenance cost more now, and that it's been challenging for nighttime taxi drivers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because passengers have changed their habits, there's been less business. I hope that after the fare hike, the government could help with the financial situation, allowing more individual visitors [to Hong Kong], so that we could get more business," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the same programme, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee ruled out the taxi trade's suggestion of a regular mechanism to review fare rates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade understands its own operating situation best... They may not submit [an application] every year, and it depends on changes to its operations and whether there is a need to ask for fare adjustments," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Every time we receive [an application], we will handle it cautiously and act as the gatekeeper. I think this approach has always been taken and is effective. So we don't have any plans to change it for the time being."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee added that how much cabbies earn is not the sole factor in deciding on fare adjustments.

    Indonesia floods kill 67, rescuers search for missing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers raced on Wednesday to find dozens of people still unaccounted for after flash floods and cold lava flow that inundated neighbourhoods and swept away houses over the weekend left 67people dead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hours of torrential rain on Saturday caused mud and rocks to flow into districts near one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, sweeping away dozens of houses and damaging roads and mosques.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The national disaster agency chief Suharyanto on Wednesday said dozens remained missing, with the figure increasing periodically.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rescuers said many of the retrieved bodies were found in or around nearby rivers after locals were swept away by the deluge of volcanic material, mud and rain that tore through neighbourhoods.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Heavy equipment was deployed to clear debris from the areas worst hit by flooding, which has affected transport access in six districts, said Suharyanto, who goes by one name.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 3,300 people have been forced to evacuate from affected areas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To aid the rescue effort, authorities on Wednesday deployed weather modification technology, the term Indonesian officials use for cloud seeding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In this case, it is being used in a bid to make clouds rain earlier so the rainfall's intensity is weakened by the time it reaches the disaster-struck area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indonesia is prone to landslides and floods during the rainy season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2022, about 24,000 people were evacuated and two children were killed in floods on Sumatra island, with environmental campaigners blaming deforestation caused by logging for worsening the disaster.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trees act as a natural defence against floods, slowing the rate at which water runs down hills and into rivers. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Children dressed up as Hong Kong celebrities, star athletes, deities and even government officials on Wednesday as thousands of people flocked to Cheung Chau for the island's annual bun festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Queues formed from the morning at shops offering buns stamped with peace messages, with sellers pleasantly surprised by the turnout.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We expected that there would be a drop of 10 to 20 percent in the visitor numbers when compared with last year. But the situation is better than our expectations," said one storekeeper surnamed Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think people want to experience the festive vibe, while hoping this can bring them peace and luck."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A man surnamed Wong told RTHK he was waiting patiently to get his hands on more than 10 buns in different flavours, for him and his family.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have waited for an hour. But I'm fine with queuing. It's not a big deal. It's just once a year. I've been coming to the festival for 12 years, since 2012," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I just hope everything goes smoothly and I wish for good health. The Cheung Chau residents believe that, so I just follow the local customs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the main highlights of the festival, the Piu Sik Parade, got underway in the afternoon, with children dressed up as various characters making their way through the island's streets on stilts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mini versions of star fencer Cheung Ka-long and swimmer Siobhan Haughey were in the Olympic spirit ahead of the upcoming Paris Games, while there were also sightings of Dragon Ball characters and Hong Kong singer and actor Aaron Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One child played security minister Chris Tang and another came as Executive Council convenor Regina Ip to explain Article 23 laws to the crowds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another child was decked out as an officer of the Environmental Protection Department, on duty to promote the city's planned waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alice, an exchange student in the SAR, hailed the atmosphere of the parade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's the drumming, all the little kids, everyone's smiling, happy. I like the lion dancers, the dragons. It's really nice, it's a really good day, lots of sun, so it's good fun. I'm staying around till the bun climbing," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indian tourist Azaira told RTHK the parade was "phenomenal".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's amazing, something I've never seen. But I think most importantly, it's the effort that everyone has taken to make this day so special," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I know it's Buddha's birthday and the costumes, the time, the effort that's taken to put into this. And of course the walking around in this heat.... I love it."

    'Social worker board vets applications individually'

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board has stressed that the statutory body reviews every application on a case-by-case basis, after the government suggested the board might have erred in renewing and approving licences from people who had committed serious crimes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers, increasing the amount of appointed members and enabling "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Wednesday said there was an urgency to make legislative amendments, and that there were "very obvious cases" that had deviated from the spirit of the law in the eyes of the public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Let's say the board approved the renewal of someone who was involved in drug possession or trafficking. I am not saying this is wrong. But it was not reasonable to approve the application, when many people within the Social Workers Registration Board had strong opinions and huge concerns about it," Sun told an RTHK programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, argued on the same programme that people who had done something wrong in the past should be given a second chance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "From the day the board was formed till now, we still review every single application on a case-by-case basis. Even if someone has a criminal record, we will still consider [the application]," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some people had committed crimes when they were young. But after many years and undergoing social work training, they had reflected and changed... Even among recipients of 'Ten Outstanding Young Persons' were people who had committed crimes like drug possession or trafficking. Does it mean society should not give them the opportunity to change?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The proposed reforms will increase the number of board members from the current 15 to 27, with all required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seventeen members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tin Shui Wai secondary school says a teacher who failed to return as scheduled on Sunday from a study trip to the mainland came back to Hong Kong the following day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Education Bureau earlier said the teacher in question didn't make it back on May 11 after a four-day mainland study tour to Wuhan for new hires. It said it would require the teacher and the school to submit a report on what happened.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CUHKFAA Thomas Cheung Secondary School said late on Tuesday that the teacher returned to the SAR on the morning of May 12.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school has reported the incident to the incorporated management committee and established an investigation committee to follow up on the matter," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school is also maintaining close contact with the Education Bureau to learn about and handle the relevant incident. No further comments will be made at this stage."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Internet users had claimed that a secondary school teacher from Hong Kong had been arrested during a trip to Wuhan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday that it will comply with a court ruling and restrict viewing in Hong Kong of 32 banned links related to the song "Glory to Hong Kong", effective immediately.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action comes after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order last week banning the 2019 protest song.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the injunction helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".

    Biden plans $1 bn in new arms for Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A displaced Palestinian boy from Rafah arrives in Khan Yunis camp in Gaza. Nearly 450,000 people have been displaced from Rafah since May 6, according to the UN. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753223_1_20240515102851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden's administration informed Congress on Tuesday of a $1 billion weapons package for Israel, official sources told AFP, a week after threatening to withhold some arms over concerns of a Rafah assault.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The administration informally notified the weapons package to Congress, which will need to approve it, a US official said, while a congressional aide who also requested anonymity said the weapons bought from US weapons makers amounted to around $1 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The weapons would come out of a major $95 billion package recently approved by Congress in defense support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and the Biden administration has repeatedly said it planned to go ahead and appropriate the funds through purchases from US manufacturers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the deal comes a week after Biden warned he may withhold bombs and artillery shells to Israel if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went ahead in defiance of US warnings with an assault on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than one million Palestinians have taken shelter after half a year of war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden administration also confirmed last week that for the first time it had halted a shipment including 2,000-pound bombs, fearing they would be used with devastating risks for civilians in Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Congress could still block the weapons sale to Israel, with left-leaning members of Biden's Democratic Party outraged by the toll on civilians in the Gaza war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the overall package passed despite opposition from the left, with the rival Republican Party almost unanimously in support of arms for Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Wall Street Journal first reported the new arms package. It said it could potentially include $700 million in tank ammunition and $500 million in tactical vehicles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden administration, while increasingly critical of Israel, has made clear it will continue to support its ally's security and pointed to US assistance last month in shooting down Iranian drones launched in retaliation for a strike on a diplomatic facility.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental," Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told reporters on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs because we do not believe they should be dropped in densely populated cities. We are talking to the Israeli government about this," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the massive Israeli retaliation, the Biden administration has twice cited emergency needs to avoid the regular 30-day review by Congress of military transfers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Critics also point out that the Biden administration has sent a regular flow of weapons unknown to the public as they fall below the threshold for congressional notification. (AFP)

    Riots rock France's New Caledonia over voting reform

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French MPs attend a debate on the constitutional bill aimed at enlarging the electorate of the overseas French territory of New Caledonia, at the French National Assembly in Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753219_1_20240515095233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person was killed, hundreds more were injured, shops were looted and public buildings torched during a second night of rioting in New Caledonia, authorities said on Wednesday, as anger over constitutional reforms from Paris boiled over.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protests against the reform turned violent Monday night, with shots fired at security forces, vehicles torched and shops looted in the worst unrest the French overseas territory has seen since the 1980s.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response, authorities deployed a heavy security contingent, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and closed the main airport.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "More than 130 arrests have been made and several dozen rioters have been taken into custody and will be brought before the courts," the French High Commission of the Republic in New Caledonia said in a statement early Wednesday morning.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Describing the "serious public disturbances" as ongoing, the High Commission decried widespread looting and torching of businesses and public property, including schools.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that classes will remain scrapped until further notice and the main airport shut to commercial flights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The unrest flared as lawmakers in France debated a bill that would increase the number of people eligible to cast ballots in the territory's provincial elections, a change critics fear could marginalise Indigenous people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Following lengthy and at times tense debates, the National Assembly in Paris adopted the reform shortly after midnight, by 351 votes to 153.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Afterwards, French President Emmanuel Macron appealed for calm on all sides.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the Noumea Accord of 1998, France vowed to gradually give more political power to the Pacific island territory of nearly 300,000 people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Under the agreement, New Caledonia has held three referendums over its ties with France, all rejecting independence. But independence retains support, particularly among the Indigenous Kanak people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Noumea Accord has also meant that New Caledonia's voter lists have not been updated since 1998 -- meaning that island residents who arrived from mainland France or elsewhere in the past 25 years do not have the right to take part in provincial polls.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The French government has branded the exclusion of one out of five people from voting as "absurd", while separatists fear that expanding voter lists would benefit pro-France politicians and reduce the weight of the Kanaks. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Erling Haaland's late penalty leaves City just 90 minutes away from another slice of English football history. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753200_1_20240515054752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland scored twice to settle Manchester City's nerves as the Premier League champions beat Tottenham 2-0 to take a giant step towards a historic fourth consecutive English title on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Norwegian forward tapped home a pinpoint Kevin De Bruyne cross early in the second half to score City's first-ever league goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and netted a late penalty to seal the three points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It takes Pep Guardiola's team two points clear of Arsenal at the top of the table and means victory at the Etihad against West Ham on Sunday will make them champions for a fourth straight season, regardless of the Gunners' result against Everton.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 No team in English top-flight history has ever won four titles in a row.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Defeat for Spurs also guarantees that Aston Villa will finish in the fourth Champions League spot, joining City, Arsenal and Liverpool in Europe's top-tier competition next season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The build-up to the game in north London was dominated by a fierce debate over whether home fans wanted their own team to lose in order to leave City in the driving seat, with Arsenal their nearest challengers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Spurs supporters made their feelings towards their bitter local rivals clear in the opening minutes, with chants of "Stand up if you hate Arsenal" ringing around the stadium.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Both sides settled quickly and Spurs had the first sight of goal when a raking ball from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg found Brennan Johnson on the right.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Johnson squared for Rodrigo Bentancur, who unleashed a fierce shot that Ederson tipped over.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario kept out Phil Foden's close-range shot after 15 minutes with a strong right hand.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City, who came into the match on an unbeaten run of 21 matches, were short of their fluent best while Spurs struggled to put the finishing touches to their attacking moves.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The game opened up towards the end of the first period, with City defender Josko Gvardiol flashing a shot over the bar from a tight angle but the sides finished the opening 45 minutes with just one shot on target apiece.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Moments after the re-start Vicario was forced to dive full length to keep out a stinging De Bruyne effort while Son Heung-min went close at the other end after being found by Johnson.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But City broke the deadlock in the 51st minute when Bernardo Silva found De Bruyne in the box and the Belgian crossed for Haaland to slot home from point-blank range.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thousands of Spurs fans chanted "Are you watching Arsenal" as the City fans celebrated in their corner.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The game then became disjointed as first De Bruyne was hurt by a Pape Sarr tackle on his ankle before Ederson took a blow to the head in denying Cristian Romero and was replaced minutes later by Stefan Ortega.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The German was called into action immediately, keeping out substitute Dejan Kulusevski's close-range shot with his legs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visitors' hearts were in their mouths when Son burst through with five minutes of normal time remaining but Ortega saved with his legs when he seemed likely to score.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Guardiola fell to the ground, clutching his head in disbelief.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead City were awarded a penalty when Pedro Porro brought down substitute Jeremy Doku and Haaland smashed home in the 91st minute to spark wild celebrations from the players in front of the City faithful, taking his league tally to 27 goals for the season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year's treble winners will prepare for Sunday's finale knowing they stand just 90 minutes away from creating another slice of football history. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq finished at a new record on Tuesday as US stocks rallied, shrugging off data that showed April wholesale inflation that topped expectations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-focused index closed at 16,511, up 0.8 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 39,558, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,246.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US wholesale prices jumped by 0.5 percent in April, much above estimates in a dynamic that could keep Federal Reserve interest rates higher for longer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, analysts noted that the gain was offset by a revision to the March report, which showed wholesale inflation cooling in that period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The numbers were more or less in line," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, who pointed to Wednesday's consumer price report as a key test for stocks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the first quarter as "notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," adding that "we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet rose 0.6 percent as the tech giant highlighted its artificial intelligence offerings at a developer conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Home Depot dipped 0.1 percent after reporting a decline in first-quarter revenues as it pointed to "continued softness" in some consumer segments. The home-improvement retailer confirmed its full-year forecast.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 GameStop jumped 60.1 percent and AMC Entertainment 32 percent in a revival of the so-called "meme stock" craze from 2021. (AFP)

 A Thai rights activist detained on royal defamation charges died on Tuesday while on hunger strike in custody, the kingdom's department of corrections said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Netiporn Sanae-sangkhom, an activist from the pro-democracy "Thaluwang" group, had been held in pre-trial detention since January.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was charged under Thailand's tough royal insult laws over a royal motorcade protest in 2020 during the peak of the kingdom's youth-led pro-democracy movement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some of the world's strictest lese-majeste laws protect King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each offence carrying a potential 15-year sentence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 28-year-old went on hunger strike shortly after detention to protest against the Thai justice system, and was immediately transferred to the medical correctional hospital over health concerns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the statement released by the department of corrections, Netiporn – also known by her nickname "Boong" – suffered from weak legs and arms as well as anaemia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She refused "minerals and vitamins" given by the hospital, the statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "She had a cardiac arrest on Tuesday morning and wasn't responsive to the treatment, which led her to die peacefully at 11:22 am (0422 GMT)," the statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that the hospital will conduct an autopsy to identify the cause of death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Southeast Asian regional branch of the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it was "deeply disturbed" by Netiporn's death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We call for transparent & impartial investigation into her death & care. Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental rights," the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the Human Rights Lawyer Association, there are at least two political prisoners in Thailand who went on hunger strike.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2023, two Thai hunger strikers held under royal insult law were given temporary release over health concerns. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert was fined US$75,000 by the NBA on Tuesday for what the league called "making an inappropriate and unprofessional gesture" questioning "the integrity of the league and game officials."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Frenchman Gobert was seen by television cameras rubbing his thumb on his fingers in a "money-sorting" gesture during Minnesota's 115-107 loss to defending NBA champion Denver on Sunday at Minneapolis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The move came after Gobert was whistled for a foul with 4:10 remaining in the fourth quarter, his second foul in as many Denver possessions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gobert won his record-tying fourth NBA Defensive Player of the Year award last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The defeat left the T-Wolves and Nuggets level at two wins each in their best-of-seven Western Conference second round series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The NBA said the fine takes into account Gobert's "history of improper conduct toward game officials."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gobert was fined US$100,000 by the NBA on March 10 for making the same gesture in a 113-104 overtime loss at Cleveland two nights earlier.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After that contest, Gobert said gambling was hurting the sport. (AFP)

    Palestinians rally at historic villages in Israel

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people took part on Tuesday in an annual march through the ruins of villages that Palestinians were expelled from during the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wrapped in keffiyeh scarves and waving Palestinian flags, men and women rallied through the abandoned villages of Al-Kassayer and Al-Husha – many holding signs with the names of dozens of other demolished villages their families were displaced from.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Your Independence Day is our catastrophe," reads the rallying slogan for the protest that took place as Israelis celebrated the 76th anniversary of the proclamation of the State of Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The protest this year was taking place against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Gaza, where fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas has displaced the majority of the population, according to the United Nations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among those marching on Tuesday was 88-year-old Abdul Rahman al-Sabah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He described how members of the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary group, forced his family out of Al-Kassayer, near the northern city of Haifa, when he was a child.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They "blew up our village, Al-Kassayer, and the village of Al-Husha so that we would not return to them, and they planted mines," he said, his eyes glistening with tears.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The family was displaced to the nearby town of Shefa-Amr.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But we continued (going back), my mother and I, and groups from the village, because it was harvest season, and we wanted to live and eat," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We had nothing, and whoever was caught by the Israelis was imprisoned."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Palestinians remember this as the "Nakba", or catastrophe, when around 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the war that led to the creation of Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who managed to remain in what became Israel presently number about 1.4 million, around 20 percent of Israel's population. (AFP)

    US Fed chair says not so confident inflation will ease

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank's long-term target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The first quarter in the United States was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," the head of the US central bank said during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected," he continued. "And so what that has told us is we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Fed has held interest rates at a 23-year high as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After making progress for much of last year, the rate at which consumer prices have been rising has accelerated since the start of 2024, pushing back expectations of interest rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Powell said that, while he still expected inflation to move back down towards the levels seen last year, "my confidence in that is not as high as it was having seen these readings in these first three months of the year."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But despite the recent uptick in inflation, Powell said he did not think it was necessary to raise rates from their current "restrictive" levels.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is," he added. (AFP)

    Georgia passes so-called 'foreign influence' bill

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Georgian police were out in force to stop protesters interrupting the passage of the bill. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753183_1_20240515002412.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia's parliament on Tuesday adopted a controversial "foreign influence" law that has sparked weeks of mass protests against the measure, which Brussels has warned would undermine Tbilisi's European aspirations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmakers voted 84 to 30 in favour during the third and final reading of the law, which was widely denounced as mirroring repressive Russian legislation used to silence dissent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The vote came as street protesters skirmished with riot police outside the building in the centre of the capital, where demonstrations have taken place over the last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scuffles had broken out inside the chamber earlier as opposition lawmakers clashed with members of the ruling Georgian Dream party.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Critics say the bill is a symbol of the ex-Soviet republic's drift closer to Russia's orbit over recent years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Around 2,000 mainly young protesters gathered outside parliament and chanted "no to the Russian law," as news spread that lawmakers had adopted the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tbilisi has seen weeks of mass rallies over the bill that culminated on Saturday, when up to 100,000 people took to the streets in the largest anti-government rally in Georgia's recent history.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EU has said the law is "incompatible" with Georgia's longstanding bid to join the 27-nation bloc, while Washington has warned its adoption would signal Tbilisi's departure from the Western orbit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The US Assistant Secretary of State, James O'Brien, on Tuesday met in Tbilisi with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, whose office said each had "expressed their concerns" over recent developments in Georgia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UK Secretary of State for Defence, Grant Shapps, labelled the foreign influence law an act of "Russian interference in Georgia."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov hit back, accusing the West of "undisguised interference in Georgia's internal affairs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said that he would be travelling on Tuesday to Georgia together with his counterparts from Iceland, Estonia and Latvia to express "our concerns."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Both protesters and the ruling Georgian Dream party have vowed not to back down and fresh rallies have been called.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some protesters say their ultimate goal is to vote out Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill requires NGOs and media outlets that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as bodies "pursuing the interests of a foreign power."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia has used a similar law to silence public figures and organisations that disagree with or deviate from the Kremlin's views.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EU on Tuesday repeated its position that the bill undermines Tbilisi's desire to move closer to the bloc.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "EU member countries are very clear that if this law is adopted it will be a serious obstacle for Georgia in its European perspective," said its spokesman, Peter Stano.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, Georgia was granted official EU candidacy, and Brussels is set to decide in December on the formal launch of accession talks – an unlikely prospect after the law's adoption.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with the government, has vowed to veto the law, though Georgian Dream has enough lawmakers in parliament to override her veto.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This law is taking away my future," 19-year-old protester Anano Plievi said outside parliament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am angry, and proud of all these people at the same time. We are going to keep going towards Europe."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian society is staunchly anti-Kremlin. Georgia's bid for membership of the EU and NATO is enshrined in its constitution and – according to opinion polls – supported by a majority of the population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 NGOs and government critics have reported months of intimidation and harassment in the run-up to the bill being reintroduced in a targeted campaign that has escalated amid the tensions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian Dream has depicted the protesters as violent mobs, insisted it is committed to joining the EU, and said the bill is aimed at increasing transparency of NGO funding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The controversy surrounding the bill comes five months before a parliamentary election seen as a crucial democratic test for the Black Sea country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)

    US raises tariffs on Chinese imports

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

    Mixed reactions to approved taxi fare increases
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 People are divided over the authorities' move to approve an increase in taxi fares, with some saying the rise is affordable and others complaining about poor taxi services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Executive Council has approved a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning from July 14, the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs, and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A student RTHK spoke to in Kowloon Tong said the fare increase is acceptable. However, he acknowledged that frequent taxi users may not be happy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am not a frequent user, so I think it is still affordable. But for some people, they may travel quite frequently on taxis. This may be a consideration for them," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A mother who often takes her children by taxi thinks that taxi drivers deserve a higher income for their hard work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think it's a big deal. I think they deserve more money because they work really hard and very long hours. Life has become more expensive, so we have to also expect that this increase needs to happen for the drivers, right?" she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A passenger said that taxi drivers should improve their services before they are allowed to increase their fares.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The price is a bit high considering their performance. The taxi service is so bad in Hong Kong. Nowadays, we don't have a way to reflect the performance of the taxi drivers. If they behave badly, we don't have a way to complain," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A taxi driver said he's worried that the fare hike could lead to a further drop in passenger numbers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "My concern is that if fares increase, we might see a drop in the number of passengers. Business is already tough, especially during the evening shift when fewer people go out."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, another taxi driver believes passengers will find the fare increase acceptable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's a reasonable increase. Passengers will eventually get used to it. Considering inflation, a slight rise in taxi fares should be acceptable to them," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi fares are set to go up after the Executive Council approved increases for cabs on Tuesday, but it was far from the jump the trade had asked for.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The industry had suggested a HK$5 increase in the flagfall for urban taxis, and set the initial charges for other cabs at HK$28.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead, the flagfall for urban taxis will increase from HK$27 to HK$29, while the starting rates will be HK$25.5 in the New Territories and HK$24 on Lantau.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The incremental charges will also be raised, with a 20-cent increase per metre jump for the first-tier distance after flagfall for urban taxis. Passengers of green and blue cabs will see the incremental rates after flagfall rise from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For second-tier distances, there will be an increase of 10 cents for all three types of taxis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The new fares are expected to take effect from July 14 after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A government spokesperson said it is important to review taxi fares to ensure a stable supply of services to cater for passengers' needs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade is facing genuine difficulty in maintaining the financial viability of its operation at the current taxi fare level," a statement read.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade hopes that an increase in taxi fares would raise the income of front-line drivers and attract more newcomers to join the industry, while at the same time encouraging taxi operators to improve their services and invest more in new facilities, thereby enhancing the overall taxi service quality and fostering the healthy development of the trade in the long run."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government also noted the approved increases were lower than the levels proposed by the taxi trade, adding the fare hike would “inevitably lead to higher transportation expenses for passengers”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Taxi charges last went up in July 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Kremlin also confirmed the trip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    Exco endorses plan to reform social worker board
   </title>
   <link>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers that will change the composition so that appointed members outnumber those elected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on the revamp, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the sector doesn't need to worry about the autonomy of the Social Workers Registration Board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At present, six of the board's 15 members are appointed, eight are elected and there is one official from the Social Welfare Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In future, 17 members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, Sun said governance of the body must be improved because it has deviated from the spirit of the law. He said, for example, the board had appointed to its disciplinary body a social worker who was facing a charge of rioting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun told reporters on Tuesday that in future, all board members must take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The board exercises public authority. What this means is that the registration of Hong Kong's 27,000 social workers, the disciplinary hearings involving them, all these are to do with public authority," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So requiring members of a statutory body exercising such authority to swear allegiance, this is only natural. It will ensure that members can safeguard our national security and that they uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the SAR government."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun said at least 14 of the 27 members of the board in future will be social workers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Everyone needs to understand that the source of social workers should actually be diverse. Some of them would be elected, others would be appointed," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The diversity at the board means that some of the social workers might be renowned professors, some might be respected leaders at social welfare organisations. This would allow for the board's operations to be more diverse and balanced."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the board will also be tasked with setting continuing professional development requirements for the sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government added in a statement that the relevant legal changes, if passed by lawmakers, will enable "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said the proposed legal changes will be gazetted on Friday, with a bill to be tabled to the legislature on May 22.

    'HK keen to promote global cooperation for prosperity'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Tuesday said that Hong Kong is well-positioned to promote global collaboration and contribute to world prosperity, as the city kicked off its first-ever conference with a focus on geopolitics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at the inaugural “Global Prosperity Summit 2024”, Ip warned that Hong Kong faces a “high degree of global geopolitical risks” due to the looming threats of “rising polarisation and political violence”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said these threats were challenging global governance, and have led to protectionist policies of tariff hikes, financial sanctions and export controls to “deny developing countries’ access to advanced technology”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The world is being factored into opposing geopolitical blocks, the free trade and investment environment over the past decades, which have helped hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, seems to belong to a bygone era,” Ip said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “With national elections in 64 countries, affecting 49 percent of the world’s population, taking place this year, politics seems to trump economics everywhere,” she added, noting that signs of polarisation and political violence were also on the rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ip said Hong Kong has a keen interest in promoting ways to resolve such issues, as it is a small but open economy that has a high degree of exposure to global risks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are a very international and cosmopolitan society, and we are very well-connected. We understand the cultures and political systems of mainland China as well as the culture and systems of the West, so we are well positioned, really, to maximise our role as a super connector and an intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world,” she told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Ip told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme the SAR is a very suitable place to host the prosperity summit given its reputation as a meeting point between East and West.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “This summit showcases Hong Kong as a platform for international dialogue and communication, because we are able to bring together experts, prominent scholars, former senior officials from all over the world to debate on the issues,” she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “When we have a free trade investment environment, everybody benefits, and we don’t want this to stop,” she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three-day summit event is sponsored by local businesses and the government and is co-hosted by the think tank Savantas Policy Institute which Ip chairs, covering topics such as de-globalisation, technological cooperation and climate change.

    Advances in imaging tech gives hope to stroke patients

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HKU researchers say advances in imaging technology have allowed more stroke patients to be treated effectively. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753099_1_20240514114851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A study from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday showed that more than a third of stroke patients who were treated beyond the traditional six-hour golden period had recovered well, offering hope to those once thought untreatable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The researchers studied more than 50 stroke patients who were treated beyond six hours, with the most notable case being a patient who was treated 22 hours after his stroke.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the HKU researchers, Associate Professor of Surgery Kevin Cheng, explained that the key to this medical breakthrough lies in advances in imaging technology, which now allows doctors to assess the proportion of brain cells that can be saved, enabling more targeted interventions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In the past, if we just base on a plain CT scan, we cannot estimate the area of the brain having damage. We can just see if there is any blood," he said
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But with the advancement in the CT perfusion, we can differentiate...which part of the brain is still salvageable and the total volume and the mismatch ratio. So these factors are very accurate and can help us to accurately differentiate those patients who can benefit."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acute ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Brain cells can quickly die while the flow of oxygen and nutrients is restricted, leading to loss of brain function, paralysis, speech problems and even death.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Tuesday said the SAR saw 3.4 million visitor arrivals in April – a 17 percent increase year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said provisional figures show about 2.5 million of the arrivals, or 73 percent, were from the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said there was an increase of more than 50 percent in arrivals from other countries compared to April last year, with a more than 80 percent rise from Indonesia, driven by the end of Ramadan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, visitor arrivals from long-haul markets such as the US and Canada increased by more than 80 percent year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said about 14.6 million visitor arrivals were recorded in the first four months of the year, which was double the figure from the same period in 2023.

    Interfering with HK's trade offices will backfire: CE
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.

    Tourists from 8 mainland cities to get HK$200 vouchers
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists hailing from eight mainland cities will be welcomed with HK$200 vouchers for restaurants and shops, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, the central government added eight new cities, including Urumqi, Hohhot and Heilongjiang to the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), allowing residents to travel to the SAR without joining a tour group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he expects visitors from the eight cities to provide a large boost to Hong Kong's tourism sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The IVS is the main source of tourists for Hong Kong. It contributed 60 percent of all mainland tourist arrivals last year. The eight cities come with large populations and they also have significant economic growth, with high spending power," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The eight cities are located in the north, northwest and northeast of China respectively. They are further away from Hong Kong, when compared with the other cities under the IVS. This will bring in a lot of overnight visitors, largely increase per capita spending, and revenues from tourism and related sectors will increase exponentially."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee said the authorities have a series of measures to attract more tourists, including the HK$200 vouchers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that a drone show at the weekend received rave reviews.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our purpose is to let locals and visitors feel the joy, when they participate in these activities. We hope to use activities to bring liveliness, and use liveliness to bring more money," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people were injured on Monday after a sightseeing helicopter to Mount Aso, an active volcano in Japan, needed to make an emergency landing due to an engine failure mid-flight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Japanese pilot and two Hong Kong tourists were on tour to the Aso Nakadake Crater in Kumamoto prefecture, when the incident occurred at noon during its return to base.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The helicopter's engine failed and an emergency landing was made on a grassy field near the mountainous area, where all three were sent conscious to hospital for treatment.

 The Immigration Department has followed up on the case with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Consulate in Fukuoka to provide assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit meant to reassure Ukrainians of continued American support and flow of weapons as Russia pummels the northeastern Kharkiv region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marking his fourth visit to Kyiv since the start of the war in February 2022, Blinken arrived by overnight train from Poland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Blinken will aim to reassure Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of enduring American support and deliver a speech focused on Ukraine's future.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kyiv has been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Russian troops have slowly advanced, mainly in the Donetsk region to the south, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of troop manpower and artillery shells.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia's forces hold a significant advantage in manpower and munitions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was trying to accelerate "the tempo of the deliveries" of weapons to Ukraine to help it reverse its disadvantage. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Tuesday said a secondary school teacher failed to return to Hong Kong after taking part in a four-day mainland study tour last week, following claims online that the educator was arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An online forum post suggested that a teacher of a subsidised school in Tin Shui Wai was picked up by mainland authorities while on a trip to Wuhan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said a mainland study tour for new teachers in Wuhan, which was held between May 8 and 11, wrapped up as scheduled, but it was notified that one member could not return to the SAR along with the group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Education Bureau attaches great importance to the discipline of participating teachers, and has required the school submit a report. The bureau will also comprehensively review relevant information and handle the case seriously. No further comments will be made at this stage," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The bureau will maintain close contact with the school and continue to follow up on the incident."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Education authorities also said teachers participating in mainland study tours must depart and return to Hong Kong as scheduled, and that they are reminded to be careful with their words and actions and to be law-abiding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Any cases of professional misconduct would be strictly followed up in accordance with the established mechanism, the bureau added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 RTHK has reached out to the school in question for comment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753080_1_20240514102308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics fought off a spirited challenge from short-handed Cleveland Monday, beating the Cavaliers 109-102 to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference semi-final series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jayson Tatum scored 33 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jaylen Brown added 27 points for the Celtics, who will try to finish off the best-of-seven series at home on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cavaliers were dealt a heavy blow when Donovan Mitchell, who had averaged more than 35 points over the six prior games, was ruled out with a calf injury, joining starting centre Jarrett Allen on the sidelines.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 NBA superstar LeBron James, who led the Cavs to their only NBA title back in 2016, was sitting courtside, but with Mitchell absent the Cavs ultimately didn't have enough firepower.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cavs kept the pressure on, taking the lead briefly on Darius Garland's driving basket early in the third quarter – their first lead since the first quarter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the Celtics quickly reasserted themselves and led by 10 going into the final period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cleveland, on the back of 30 points from Garland, pulled within five points three times in the final four minutes, but Brown, fed by Tatum, connected on a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that effectively sealed it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a game of runs," Tatum said after the Celtics struggled to put the depleted Cavaliers away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's not going to be perfect every single time. They're going to make shots, but it's our job to figure it out." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, preparing for his first professional fight since 2005, warned YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on Monday that his life will be on the line during their July 20 bout.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 57-year-old Tyson, speaking at New York City's Apollo Theater during a press conference to promote a fight against an opponent who is 30 years his junior, said he wants to show the world he is still a great fighter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I really like Jake a lot but once he's in that ring he has to fight like his life depends on it, because it will be," said Tyson.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The heavyweight bout at the Arlington, Texas home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys will be contested over eight two-minute rounds with each fighter using 14-ounce gloves. The outcome will be included in both fighters' professional boxing records.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tyson, who said he requested the shorter rounds because he feels it will lead to greater action and a more entertaining fight, shot back at critics who suggested he is making a big mistake by returning to boxing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The people who said that wish they were up here," said Tyson. "Because no one else can do it. Who else can do this? Who else can shut the sporting world down, no one else can do it. So you got the both of us.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We're friends, but in that ring we're not going to be friends."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tyson also said he did not hesitate at the chance to fight Paul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It was a no-brainer," said Tyson.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He was the new up and coming guy on the scene and I like shaking the sports world to it's core and I'm doing it now. It's just something I want to do."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Paul, a 27-year-old YouTube influencer-turned-boxer, has won nine of 10 boxing matches with six knockouts against a mix of celebrities and middling fighters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He suffered his sole career boxing loss in February 2023 when he lost a split decision to Tommy Fury, the half brother of World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Tyson Fury. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel battled Hamas in Gaza on Monday, including in far-southern Rafah, despite US warnings against a full-scale invasion of the crowded city and of the threat from post-war anarchy or insurgency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Clashes also raged in northern and central Gaza as Israel marked a sombre Memorial Day, followed by Independence Day from Monday night, more than seven months into the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israelis marked a moment's silence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that "our war of independence is not over yet. It continues even today... We are determined to win this struggle."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 AFP correspondents in Gaza reported helicopter strikes and heavy artillery shelling in the east of Rafah, as well as battles in northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel last week defied a chorus of warnings -- including from top ally Washington which paused a shipment of bombs -- and sent tanks and troops into the east of Rafah to pursue militants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The city on the Egyptian border had been sheltering 1.4 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations, but Israel's military operation sparked an exodus of nearly 360,000 people from Rafah so far, said the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agency warned that "no place is safe" in the territory, much of which has been reduced to a grey landscape of rubble.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington had not seen any credible Israeli plan to protect civilians in Rafah, and that "we also haven't seen a plan for what happens the day after this war in Gaza ends".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Israel's on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas," he told NBC. (AFP)

    Duran double salvages draw for Villa against Liverpool

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Jhon Duran scored two late goals as Aston Villa fought back to salvage a 3-3 home draw with Liverpool on Monday and take a significant step towards a place in the Champions League next season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A match that started with Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez conceding a shocking second minute own-goal turned into a thriller with Duran coming on to save the night with goals in the 85th and 88th minutes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Villa are now on 68 points with one game remaining, five clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur who have two matches still to come.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Liverpool were gifted the opener when Argentine international Martinez fumbled a tame Harvey Elliot cross, desperately clawing the ball across the line and into his own net.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Villa, who would have secured fourth place with a win and must now wait for Tottenham's home game against title-chasers Manchester City on Tuesday, equalised 10 minutes later through Youri Tielemans.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cody Gakpo made it 2-1 to the third-placed visitors in the 23rd, after a VAR check for offside, and Jarell Quansah then headed in off the post from a free kick for his first Premier League goal in the 48th. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A revival in GameStop and other meme stocks overshadowed a mixed performance in the broader stock market on Monday as a Dow winning streak ended.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Art Hogan, from B. Riley Financial, said the markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's consumer price index report for April.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The market will celebrate signs of moderating inflation, Hogan said, while further signs of intensifying inflation will lead to "the kind of selling pressure that we saw in April."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 percent to 39,431, ending an eight-day winning streak.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 was flat at 5,221, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 percent to 16,388.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monday's light schedule in terms of economic reports continued the sleepy tenor of last week, when stocks climbed on hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The inflation report -- along with this week's retail sales data -- will inform expectations about US monetary policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, GameStop rocketed 70.9 percent higher while AMC Entertainment surged 80.9 percent. Both benefited from the return to social media of "Roaring Kitty," whose posts helped ignite a massive rally in a handful of stocks in January 2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Apple jumped 1.8 percent following a Bloomberg report that the smartphone giant is close to a deal with OpenAI to add ChatGPT to iPhones. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's one-time fixer and the star prosecution witness in the former president's historic criminal trial testified on Monday that he lied and bullied for his former boss who looked on silently.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Michael Cohen's testimony followed last week's court proceedings in which adult film star Stormy Daniels gave toe-curling detail about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump which is at the heart of the case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump, 77, is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer Cohen for a hush-money payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, when the story could have proved politically fatal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if, as a lawyer-fixer for the property tycoon, he lied and bullied people on behalf of Trump.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Yes... It was what was needed in order to accomplish the task," said Cohen who periodically glanced over at Trump who was slouched in his chair at the defendant's table.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cohen spent just over 13 months in jail and a year and a half under house arrest after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for lying to Congress and financial crimes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the first weeks of the trial in New York, jurors have heard from witnesses that Cohen was a difficult character who cajoled others to get his way, while the defence counsel have painted him as a pathological liar and convicted criminal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cohen testified on Monday that he worked on both personal and corporate issues for Trump, who he claimed did not have an email address for fear of leaving a paper trial that could be used to prosecute him.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daniels, who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006, has denied she threatened him if he did not buy her silence for US$130,000, a payment that prosecutors say Trump then covered up.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The trial is taking place six months before the November election, when Trump will try to defeat Democratic President Joe Biden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During nearly eight hours over two days last week, Daniels walked the jury through the one-night stand she said she had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, and then the financial settlement she says ensued.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump had sat impassively for much of Daniels's testimony, apparently cursing at times, and railing against proceedings in his comments to reporters as he entered and left the Manhattan courtroom.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump has denied having sex with Daniels, and his lawyers asked the judge for a mistrial on the grounds her testimony was "extremely prejudicial" in what is essentially a financial records and election-related case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Judge Juan Merchan denied two mistrial requests last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Merchan has imposed a gag order on Trump prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, and the ex-president -- who has traded insults with Daniels for years, calling her "horseface" and other crude slurs -- has not commented directly on her testimony.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump spoke at a rally on a beach in New Jersey on Saturday and condemned the judge as "conflicted" and the prosecutor in the case, Alvin Bragg, as a "radical Democrat."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he appeared to heed the gag order and avoided naming any witnesses in the case, including Cohen.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He has also been charged in Florida with allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House but that case has been postponed indefinitely. (AFP)

    Banks 'light the flame of the climate crisis'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's biggest banks financed fossil fuels to the tune of US$705 billion in 2023, with US and Japanese lenders leading the way, an annual report by climate campaigners said on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the top 60 banks have provided a total of US$6.9 trillion to the sector, according to the coalition's 15th annual report titled "Banking on Climate Chaos".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis," said Tom BK Goldtooth, executive director of Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the report's authors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year's fossil fuel funding was down 9.5 percent from 2022, the report said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But some banks increased their exposure to climate risk, it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 JPMorgan was the top financier last year, providing US$41 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from 2022, according to the report.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Japan's Mizuho moved up to second place with US$37 billion, followed by Bank of America at US$33.7 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As one of the world's largest financiers to both traditional and clean energy companies, we help power today's global economy," said a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson in response.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We believe our data reflects our activities more comprehensively and accurately than estimates by third parties. Reflecting our strategy of supporting the build-out of zero-carbon power, we set a net-zero aligned Energy Mix target and will disclose a clean energy supply financing ratio." (AFP)

    Rishi Sunak defends beleaguered Tories' track record

    <![CDATA[<img a="" alt="British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he's " confident"="" consecutive="" fifth="" his="" in="" office.="" party="" photo:="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" reuters"="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753030_1_20240514002111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto" term="" win="" would=""/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted on Monday that his beleaguered governing Conservative party can win a general election despite polls consistently indicating the opposite, but refused to set a date for the vote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sunak mounted a defence of the Tories' 14 years in power and claimed that Britain would be less safe under Keir Starmer's Labour opposition, which is widely tipped to come back to power.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The UK leader said he was "confident" his party would win a fifth consecutive term but conceded that Labour, out of government since 2010, may ultimately inflict defeat.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm clear-eyed enough to admit that, yes, maybe they can depress their way to victory," Sunak said in a speech in central London, accusing Labour of "scaremongering" and "gaslighting".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But I don't think it will work because at heart we are a nation of optimists," he added, before warning of several dangers himself.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sunak cited Russia's war in Europe, Iran's firing of missiles in the Middle East and the uncertainty posed by artificial intelligence as threats that needed to be tackled.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also referred to "authoritarian" states, including and North Korea, Scottish nationalists who want to break away from the United Kingdom and "cancel culture".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our country stands at a crossroads," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous, yet most transformational, our country has ever known," Sunak added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sunak's speech at the right-wing Policy Exchange think-tank is a clear pre-election pitch to voters, as Labour increasingly puts flesh on the bones of its policies before a manifesto launch.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its repeated attacks on Starmer also gave an indication of a potentially bitter and personal election battle ahead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Sunak refused again to be drawn on when he would call the vote, repeating his well-trodden line that he was aiming for the second half of the year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He can go to the polls no later than January 2025.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour has enjoyed double-digit leads over the Tories in surveys since the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss that ended in October 2022, and inflicted heavy losses on the Conservatives in local elections earlier this month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The opposition -- overhauled since Starmer took over in the aftermath of Boris Johnson's election landslide for the Conservatives in 2019 -- has pledged to run the economy responsibly and hopes to match Sunak's recent pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the prime minister argued that only his party can protect Britons' safety and financial security, even after a decline in defence spending from 2010 to 2016 and the financial meltdown caused by Truss.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are storms ahead. The dangers are all too real," said Sunak, a former finance minister.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But Britain can feel proud again. Britain can feel confident again. Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Asked about Sunak's speech, Starmer said security would be the "first priority" of a Labour administration.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the choice at the ballot box would be between "a changed Labour Party that puts the country first and party second" and "the chaos and division" of the Conservatives. (AFP)

    Swiatek shrugs off climate protests at Rome Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Poland's Iga Swiatek signs autographs after winning her round of 16 match against Germany's Angelique Kerber. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753029_1_20240514001701.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iga Swiatek saw off Angelique Kerber 7-5, 6-3 at the Rome Open on Monday to set up a quarter-final clash with Madison Keys, who came through against Sorana Cirstea despite her match being interrupted by climate activists.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 World number one Swiatek is yet to drop a set and is favourite for a third Foro Italico crown before she begins her French Open title defence later this month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three-time Roland Garros champion arrived in the Italian capital off the back of a thrilling triumph in Madrid, her third WTA 1000 title of the season after also winning at Indian Wells and Doha.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the 22-year-old didn't have it all her own way against former world number one Kerber, a three-time former Grand Slam champion who at 331st was the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the last 16 in this tournament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Swiatek battled to the first set in just under an hour and was frequently put to the test by 36-year-old German Kerber, who fell behind after saving five set points in game 10 and then succumbing two games later.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kerber went two ahead in the second set but Swiatek fought back and after the Pole broke serve in game eight she held steady to close out the match.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Swiatek will face Keys whose 6-2, 6-1 win was suspended for half an hour by a court invasion from activists from Ultima Generazione (Last Generation).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wearing orange vests, protestors threw a liquid and confetti onto the Pietrangeli court, where Keys was playing, and court 12 where a men's doubles match was taking place.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There were also protestors in the stands with a tournament spokesman telling AFP that at least one person had tried to glue their feet to the floor in order to slow their removal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Obviously it's not the greatest feeling when you're on court, your first reaction is kind of your own safety," said Keys.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think maybe banning cementing glue from bags would be a start.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's obviously something that's becoming more of an occurence and something that tournaments are going to have to figure out how to stop."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daniil Medvedev will continue his title defence against Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic with the men's tournament wide open following a series of big-name exits, the latest being fourth seed Andrey Rublev.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rome is missing the world's top three men following Novak Djokovic's early elimination on Saturday, with Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz both withdrawing ahead of the event.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And Russian Rublev, fresh from claiming the Madrid title, suffered a shock third-round defeat by French qualifier Alexandre Muller, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sixth seed and reigning Monte Carlo champion Stefanos Tsitsipas is still in the fray after beating Briton Cameron Norrie in straight sets 6-2, 7-6 (7/1).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Naomi Osaka's return to the Rome Open was ended at the last 16 by China's Zheng Qinwen who breezed past her four-time Grand Slam winning opponent 6-2, 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with third seed Coco Gauff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Japan's Osaka, who has never won a title on clay, was playing at the Foro Italico for the first time in three years after taking a break from the tour to have her first child and is ranked at 173 in the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think I'm happy with my performance in Rome. It's been a while since I played well on -- I guess I've never played well on clay -- so I guess I'm happy," Osaka told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Later Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka will face Elina Svitolina for the first time since their handshake row at last year's French Open.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Belarusian second seed Sabalenka was accused by Ukraine's Svitolina of inflaming tensions surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war after the Roland Garros quarter-final between the pair in 2023.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sabalenka waited at the net for a handshake after beating Svitolina, even though Svitolina had already insisted she was not going to offer one, as all Ukraine players refused to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian rivals in protest at the ongoing war. (AFP)

    Anglo American rebuffs BHP's revised offer

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian mining giant BHP announced on Monday that British rival Anglo American has rejected an "improved" takeover bid worth £34 billion (almost HK$333.5 billion).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 BHP's latest offer, which aims to create the world's biggest-listed copper producer, comes after its initial £31.1-billion approach had already been rebuffed last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The revised proposal was rejected by the Anglo American board on 13 May 2024. BHP is disappointed that the... board has chosen not to engage with BHP with respect to the revised proposal and the improved terms," the company said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The new bid was pitched at £27.53 per share, up from £25.08 per share that had been slammed by Anglo as "highly unattractive" and "opportunistic" in April.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 BHP has lifted the number of shares that would be given to Anglo investors under the improved terms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And it still plans to split off Anglo's platinum and iron ore subsidiaries in South Africa, with shares split between the British firm's shareholders.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "BHP put forward a revised proposal to the Anglo American Board that we strongly believe would be a win-win for BHP and Anglo American shareholders," said BHP chief executive Mike Henry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are disappointed that this second proposal has been rejected," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The latest offer would increase Anglo's share of the new combined group to 16.6 percent, up from 14.8 percent previously.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "BHP and Anglo American are a strategic fit and the combination is a unique and compelling opportunity to unlock significant synergies by bringing together two highly complementary, world class businesses," added Henry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The combined business would have a leading portfolio of high-quality assets in copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal and BHP would bring its track record of operational excellence to maximise returns from these high-quality assets."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In mid-afternoon deals on the London stock market, Anglo American's share price slid 0.8 percent to £27.51, while BHP dipped 0.6 percent to £22.83. (AFP)

    Weightlifting body chair remarks unacceptable: govt

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The culture, sports and tourism minister, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said it was unacceptable that repeated mistakes were made by the chairwoman of the city's weightlifting and powerlifting body.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also called on Josephine Ip of the Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association to publicly address her mistakes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is unacceptable for the same mistakes to happen over and over. We hope that the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China can come up with a long-term solution so that similar incidents won't happen again," Yeung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because in both instances the chairwoman was at fault, she should explain to the public herself."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The association had apologised for a remark made by Ip during a competition on May 6. The event featured competitors from 13 countries along with the SAR and Chinese Taipei, and Ip said it had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her remark drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The sports body explained the chairwoman made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence while giving a speech at the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On another occasion, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a "slip of the tongue".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said the administration would take appropriate action based on findings of the investigation to ensure people speaking on behalf of a sports association or the sector understood that every single word is very important.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, for its part, said it is reviewing the report submitted by the weightlifting and powerlifting body and would keep in contact with the government how to handle the matter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

 Police on Monday said they arrested 34 people for allegedly operating electric bikes and scooters without a licence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The suspects, aged between 19 and 69, were also charged with offences such as driving unlicensed vehicles and using them on pavements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers added that they seized 34 electric bikes and scooters in various areas in the New Territories, such as Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau, in a two-day operation last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, senior inspector Ngai Siu-Cheong reminded people not to use unlicensed electric vehicles on public roads.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Anyone using unregistered and unlicensed electric vehicles on the road may be in violation of the Road Users' Code and other relevant laws. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty includes a fine of HK$10,000 and 12-month imprisonment," he said.
