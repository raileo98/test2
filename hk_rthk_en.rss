<div class="itemFullText">
 The Edmonton Oilers held off a furious late rally to defeat the Florida Panthers 5-3 and keep their dreams of an improbable Stanley Cup Final comeback alive on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Oilers, down 3-0 after the first three games of the best-of-seven series, built on the momentum from their 8-1 thrashing of Florida on Saturday to claim a hard-fought road win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers now have the chance to level the series with a victory on their home ice in Edmonton in game six on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edmonton are bidding to become only the second team in ice hockey history to overturn a 3-0 series deficit to lift the Stanley Cup after Toronto achieved the feat in 1942.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor McDavid's second goal of the night in the dying seconds sealed a pulsating victory for the Oilers, who are hoping to end Canada's 31-year wait for a Stanley Cup champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Brown fired the short-handed Oilers into the lead after just 5min 30, snaffling possession near halfway during a Florida power play before coolly rounding Sergei Bobrovsky and tucking away the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers doubled their lead early in the second period with a power-play goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They held firm after McDavid's second goal of the night, an empty-netter, ensured a game six on Saturday morning at eight, Hong Kong time. (AFP)

    'Hong Kong to act as window to promote hydrogen use'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan says the development of hydrogen helps Hong Kong gain business opportunities. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758087_1_20240619111244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said it would be difficult for Hong Kong to pursue large-scale production and usage of hydrogen, but the city could act as the mainland's showcase to the international community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, the minister said limited space in Hong Kong made it difficult for the mass production of hydrogen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tse said the SAR could leverage its unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can act as a window, a base for demonstration, to promote hydrogen products overseas. The international community can also come to Hong Kong for financing when it needs to," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hydrogen development is not only for us and helping us to pursue carbon neutrality, but it is also an opportunity for business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government earlier announced its strategy on hydrogen development, aimed at addressing climate change and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with 14 trial projects in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the administration is now looking into which industries would be suitable and cost-effective to use hydrogen, which is relatively pricey, and will formulate standards and guidelines.

    Baseball legend Willie Mays dies at 93

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John F. Kennedy Jr. with Willie Mays at Shea Stadium in New York in June 1972. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758073_1_20240619100119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Willie Mays, the Hall of Fame centerfielder whose all-around skills made him one of greatest baseball players of all time, died on Tuesday at the age of 93, Major League Baseball announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mays, who brought an explosive exuberance to the game in his peak years, died of heart failure, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays played 23 seasons for the New York Giants, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets, from 1951 through 1973.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his prime, he could do it all on the baseball field. Mays was the epitome of what came to be known as a "five-tool player" – meaning he was exceptional at hitting for average, hitting for power, fielding, throwing and base running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Mays' talent was only part of what made him a superstar. He also played with a verve and passion that were discernible even to spectators in the cheap seats. He was known for playing stickball with kids on the streets of Harlem, near the former Polo Grounds where he played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the real games, fans delighted when Mays would sprint with such speed and fury that he would run out from under his hat as he stole a base or chased down a flyball to deep centerfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His snag of a fly ball in the 1954 World Series, sprinting with his back toward home plate some 460 feet away, is known simply as The Catch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays, known as "The Say Hey Kid" because of his standard greeting, was ranked second on The Sporting News' 1998 list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players – behind Babe Ruth and ahead of Ty Cobb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility, won the Most Valuable Player award twice and was named to the all-star team 24 times, a record shared only with Hank Aaron and Stan Musial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he retired, Mays held third place on the all-time home run list with 660, behind Aaron at 755 and Ruth with 714. He was also the first ballplayer to hit 300 homers and steal 300 bases. (Reuters)

    Ronaldo's Portugal scrape Euro 2024 opening win

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal beat the Czech Republic 2-1 to claim a Euro 2024 debut victory on Tuesday but they needed to come from behind with a 92nd-minute winner from youngster Francisco Conceicao.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the section's other clash, Turkey bested Georgia 3-1 in a pulsating match in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roberto Martinez's Portugal qualified at a canter with a 100 percent record, but only just scraped victory in Leipzig in their first match, under driving rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs went ahead against the run of play through Lukas Provod's fine strike from the edge of the box after the hour mark, but Robin Hranac's own goal soon pulled Portugal level before Conceicao's winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronaldo was thrice denied by goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek on a record Euros appearance and headed against the post, but was offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diogo Jota put the rebound into the net but the goal was disallowed after the VAR highlighted Al Nassr striker Ronaldo's infringement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not matter for Portugal in the end as 21-year-old Porto winger Conceicao struck from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs were left agonising after battling so hard and almost claiming a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It hurts terribly when you work like this for 90 minutes, you give everything and you lose in the end," said Czech goalscorer Provod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our defenders played an incredible game. We just needed a bit more luck."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A well-supported Turkey started the Euros in entertaining fashion with an end-to-end win over debutants Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid playmaker Arda Guler scored a brilliant goal, along with strikes by Mert Muldur and Kerem Akturkoglu, to delight the masses of Turkish supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia were dangerous after Georges Mikautadze levelled Muldur's superbly hit opener, and struck the woodwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was below his best but despite defeat his team offered enough to give themselves hope for the matches ahead, against the Czech Republic and then Portugal. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 reaching a new record on a day that Nvidia edged ahead of Microsoft to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, closed 3.5 percent higher, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of the tech giants Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were kind of waiting for this moment, actually, for quite some time," said Angelo Zino from the financial intelligence firm CFRA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The semiconductor industry is now the biggest sub-industry in the S&P 500," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices rose on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 rising 0.3 percent to reach a new all-time high of 5,487.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.2 percent to 38,834, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up less than 0.1 percent at 17,862.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid the ongoing enthusiasm for Nvidia, other chip companies saw gains on Tuesday, including Qualcomm and Micron, which closed up 2.2 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="David Calhoun stood and turned to apologise to relatives of the crashes face-to-face. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758044_1_20240619042133.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's CEO acknowledged to a US congressional panel on Tuesday that the company's culture was imperfect, but insisted the aviation giant was making progress and committed to improving safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Our culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress," David Calhoun said early in the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun opened his remarks by standing to apologise to family members of victims from two Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing, an examination of "Boeing's Broken Safety Culture," follows an April session of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations featuring a Boeing engineer who testified that he was punished for raising safety questions about the top-selling 787 Dreamliner and 777.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun's appearance marks his first testimony before a congressional panel since an alarming mid-flight incident in January on a 737 Max plunged the company back into crisis mode. US investigators are still probing the incident with the Alaska Airlines plane, which made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, the Senate committee detailed additional complaints from Boeing workers, including an official filing from a whistleblower who worried that Boeing's lax policies on the use of damaged or inadequate parts could "lead to a catastrophic event," according to a subcommittee memo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing stands "at a moment of reckoning and an opportunity to change a broken safety culture," said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who is chairing the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The session comes ahead of a Department of Justice determination on next steps after concluding in May that the company could be prosecuted for violating a criminal settlement following two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, off Indonesia and in Ethiopia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blumenthal said there "is near overwhelming evidence... that prosecution should be pursued."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a federal court of its plans by July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the April 17 hearing, witnesses painted a disturbing picture of a company that dismissed safety questions and sidelined critics as it chased faster production and bigger profits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star witness was engineer Sam Salehpour, who went public with allegations that, because of flawed manufacturing processes, the Dreamliner could suffer a potentially catastrophic accident because of excessively large gaps in the plane's assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has pointed to extensive testing that it says proves the 787 is safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun emphasised that he welcomes when workers speak out about problems, viewing such expressions as a critical component of safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pledged to get back to the committee on questions about workers who may have been fired for expressing concerns about safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun also said he would provide details on instances on how the company responds to workers who engage in retaliation against workers who speak out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In connection with the probe, Blumenthal and Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, sent a letter to Calhoun seeking records that would shed light on Salehpour's allegations about the 787 and 777, as well as records relating to Boeing's whistleblower policies and protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same two senators also sent a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker related to the allegations, as well as other ongoing Boeing-related matters, such as a six-week FAA audit of the company following the Alaska Airlines incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate panel on Tuesday released details on additional workers who have come forward with problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes a new whistleblower, Sam Mohawk, who said that Boeing ordered improperly stored parts to be hidden from federal aviation inspectors, who would have demanded Boeing increase storage capacity and hire additional staff, raising costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing was attended by a small group of family members who lost relatives in the 2018 and 2019 Max crashes, which together claimed 346 lives. The group held signs with their loved ones at the outset of the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also held a press conference just ahead of the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun is a "mass killer," said Adnaan Stumo, brother to Nadia Milleron, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. "There needs to be criminal charges for the people at the top. The people in the driver's seat were responsible for 346 deaths, including my sister." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday morning for his first visit in 24 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit – at the invitation of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un – underscores Moscow's growing relationship with the nuclear-armed state since Russia began its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin was greeted by North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un at a welcoming ceremony at an airport in Pyongyang and the pair embraced and shook hands.

  The Russian leader issued a presidential order on the eve of the visit, saying Moscow was looking to sign a "comprehensive strategic partnership treaty" with North Korea, which his foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said would include security cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ushakov said the deal would not be directed against any other country, but would "outline prospects for further cooperation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will include one-on-one discussions between the two leaders, as well as a gala concert, state reception, honour guards, document signings, and a statement to the media, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Putin's aide Ushakov as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow has said Putin will next travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's key allies such as China.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia edged ahead of other tech companies on Tuesday to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in the latest sign of the might of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, jumped 3.4 percent near 1:25 pm (1725 GMT), giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The California-based company, which is led by Jensen Huang, has seen profits soar due to torrid demand for its powerful GPU chips, which have set the industry's pace in pushing new advances in AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, Nvidia reported a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe over the next year the race to US$4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft," said a note earlier this week from Wedbush Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway." (AFP)

    Black hole observed 'awakening' for the first time

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This artist’s impression shows the growing disc of material being pulled in by the black hole as it feeds on the gas available, making the galaxy light up. Image: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758034_1_20240619021538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Astronomers have been able to observe a supermassive black hole waking up and setting the heart of its host galaxy alight for the first time, the European Southern Observatory said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The galaxy 300 million light years from Earth in the Virgo constellation had been quiet for decades until late 2019, when it suddenly began to shine brighter than ever before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre of the galaxy – where a supermassive black hole is believed to be squatting – since then has been radiating a variety of rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This behaviour is unprecedented," Paula Sanchez Saez, an European Southern Observatory astronomer and first author of a new study in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "most tangible option" to explain this brightening is that the astronomers were watching "the activation of a massive black hole in real time," study co-author Lorena Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most galaxies – including our own Milky Way – are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These cosmic behemoths are by definition invisible – not even light can escape the pull of their awesome power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only way to observe black holes is when they destroy something huge that lets off light in its death throes: such as a star that wandered too close being torn apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These giant monsters usually are sleeping," study co-author Claudio Ricci explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for the galaxy SDSS1335+0728, "we were able to observe the awakening of the massive black hole, (which) suddenly started to feast on gas available in its surroundings, becoming very bright," the astrophysicist added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial observations indicate the black hole has 1.5 million times more mass than the Sun, enough for it to be classified as a supermassive black hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is still on the lighter side, as the true heavyweights easily exceed a billion times the Sun's mass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The international team of astronomers is analysing data from a number of telescopes hoping to determine whether the black hole's activity is temporary – perhaps caused by a star being ripped apart – or whether it will continue to be active for a long time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is something that could happen also to our own Sgr A*," the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fortunately for us, our own black hole remains fast asleep. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Timberlake was arrested early on Tuesday on allegations that the singer was driving while intoxicated on New York’s Long Island, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was released from custody later in the morning after being arraigned in Sag Harbor, on the eastern end of Long Island. He was charged with one DWI count, with his next court date scheduled for July 26, the Suffolk County district attorney’s office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake’s lawyer and representatives did not immediately return requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor is a coastal village in the Hamptons, around 160 kilometres from New York City. In the summer, it is a hot spot for wealthy visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A young Timberlake was a Disney Mouseketeer, where his castmates included future girlfriend Britney Spears. He rose to fame in the boy band NSYNC and embarked on a solo recording career in 2002. As an actor, Timberlake has won acclaim in movies including "The Social Network” and “Friends With Benefits.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has won 10 Grammy awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Timberlake was in the headlines when Spears released her memoir, “The Woman in Me.” Several chapters were devoted to their relationship, including deeply personal details about a pregnancy, abortion and painful breakup. In March, he released his first new album in six years, the nostalgic “Everything I Thought It Was,” a return to his familiar future funk sound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake has two upcoming shows in Chicago on Friday and Saturday, then is scheduled for New York's Madison Square Garden next week on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli intelligence brief prepared weeks before Hamas's October 7 attack had warned military officials of the Palestinian group's preparations for an assault, according to Israeli public broadcaster Kan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military's signals intelligence unit drafted the brief in September, less than a month before the Hamas attack that sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, Kan reported on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the Unit 8200 intelligence document included details of elite Hamas fighters training for hostage-taking and plans for raids on military positions and Israeli communities in southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brief said the Palestinian militants were aiming to take hundreds of hostages, Kan reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The expected number of hostages: 200-250 people", the brief said according to Kan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unprecedented Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 251 people hostage, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 41 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive since October 7 has killed at least 37,372 people in the Gaza Strip, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Kan, citing unnamed security officials, the brief was known to intelligence officials in the military's Gaza Division and Southern Command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli politicians have rebuffed calls for a thorough investigation into intelligence failures surrounding the Hamas attack, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted any official probe should wait until after the war, now in its ninth month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military however said it was "investigating the events" of October 7, with a probe being "actively carried out" that would later be made public. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Immigration Department says some 180,000 people have not replaced their old smart ID cards, and they're urged to do so as early as possible.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department on Tuesday said the old form of smart identity cards will be invalidated in 2025 in two phases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For individuals who were born in 1970 or after, their ID cards will be invalid from May 12 next year; for those born in 1969 or earlier, their ID cards will no longer be valid from October 12, 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This applies to the old form of smart ID cards issued before November 26, 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department noted that some 90 percent of the old ID card holders have already replaced their cards by the end of last month. But some 180,000 people have not yet renewed their cards, possibly because they are working or studying overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They're being urged to do so as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities stressed that the invalidation of the old ID cards will not affect individuals’ permanent residency rights in the SAR.

    'La Dolce Vita', '8 1/2' star Anouk Aimee dies at 92

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Anouk Aimee received the honorary Golden Bear award in 2003 for her lifetime achievement. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758023_1_20240618221507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anouk Aimee, the French actress whose movies included Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita", Jacques Demy's "Lola" and Claude Lelouch's "A Man and a Woman", has died aged 92.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We bid farewell to a world-famous icon, to a great actress of French cinema who took on roles for some of the biggest names, such as Demy, Lelouch and Fellini," said French Culture Minister Rachida Dati on social media platform X on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's daughter Manuela Papatakis said in an Instagram post that Aimee had passed away at home in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her role as a lovelorn widow in "A Man and a Woman" (1966) famous for its "chabadabada, chabadabada" theme tune won her an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe for best actress and her entry into Hollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's elegant sophistication had already made her a star of such European masterpieces as Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" (1960) and "8 1/2" (1963), and she was unforgettable as the ageing showgirl in Jacques Demy's heartbreaking musical "Lola" (1961).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellini in particular revered her, saying her "face has the same intriguing sensuality as that of (Greta) Garbo, (Marlene) Dietrich or (Cindy) Crawford, these great mysterious queens, these priestesses of femininity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anouk Aimee represents the kind of woman who worries you to death," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That combination of "melancholy and passion" marked much of her remarkable career, with the American director Robert Altman bringing her out of retirement to rekindle her old spark with Marcello Mastroianni in the acclaimed "Pret a Porter" in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born Francoise Dreyfus in Paris on April 27, 1932, Aimee was the scion of a theatrical family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her life was turned upside down when German troops marched into the city when she was eight. Her father was Jewish, putting the family in mortal danger, even though she was raised a Catholic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We moved all the time. We hid... But then the Germans turned up and took over the apartment downstairs," she recalled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family sent her to the countryside where they hoped she would be safer, changing her name so she would not have to wear a yellow star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her lifelong love of animals was born from the comfort they gave her during her time in hiding, she later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war over, her career began at the age of 13 when she was picked from the street to play in a Marcel Carne film that was never finished for lack of money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finally made her screen debut the following year and adopted her character's name, Anouk, as her own. It would become popular in France thanks to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was French poet and screenwriter Jacques Prevert who convinced her to also change her surname to Aimee, meaning "loved".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career took off in 1949 with Andre Cayatte's "The Lovers of Verona". Her class and beauty brought her a string of roles including in "Montparnasse 19" by Jacques Becker before she began to work with Demy and Fellini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2002 she was awarded an honorary Cesar – France's Oscars – and Cannes paid tribute to her four years later. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Tuesday announced that it is working with four mobile network operators to enhance 5G coverage at 24 stations, with an IT expert hailing it a step towards Hong Kong becoming a smart city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a press release, the railway firm said it is installing 3.3 and 3.5 GHz indoor base stations in the 24 stations to provide a faster and smoother mobile service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upgrading works at Tin Hau station have already been completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new 5G network will be installed in Wan Chai, Kowloon and Admiralty stations this year, and other stations by the end of 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, called the upgrade a long-awaited move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, there were so many MTR customers complaining about using their mobile data, where the mobile data speed is very slow and [they] always [lose] connection," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this is something that MTR passengers have been waiting for so long so that they can have a much faster and more stable network in the MTR stations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong added that upgrading the railway infrastructure is an important step to turn Hong Kong into a smart city and an innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Communications Authority also welcomed the move, saying it will "significantly increase the speed and capacity of 5G services along MTR lines".

 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government will recruit talent from primarily Southeast Asia and Europe in the coming year, with Malaysia being the first stop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Sun spoke about the multilingual skills of Malaysians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are fluent in English, and many also speak fluent Cantonese and Mandarin. There’s a good talent pool and I think it’s worthy for us to give it a try,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During my visits to Southeast Asia, I can tell many people there are eager to come to Hong Kong. But we need to realise that they are not here on travel, they want to work. So if they could be introduced to what to prepare as well as the development opportunities in Hong Kong, that will increase their desire to come to the SAR.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said the government will try to recruit financial and technology talent from Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the welfare chief mentioned a three-year plan to boost the number of care workers in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme to import care workers for residential care homes was rolled out in June last year, and Sun noted that all 7,000 places available under the quota were used up in the first three rounds of applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said after considering factors such as an ageing population and manpower loss, the SAR will need to import 8,000 more care workers over the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that the priority is still on local workers. “I understand that many local care workers hope to earn more money and have better promotion opportunities, but fail to do so due to their lower education level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government will study if care workers with less formal education could be promoted, with the emphasis instead on their work experience, Sun added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small and medium-sized brokers have enough time and support to get themselves ready, officials said on Tuesday, as the financial market is set to remain in operation under severe weather conditions from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The securities and derivatives markets, including northbound and southbound trading, will continue operating during severe weather conditions, while banks and securities dealers will provide electronic services but shut down their physical outlets, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brokers are required to set up a remote office and adopt digital trading by the implementation date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For those failing to meet the requirements, they can assign a small number of staff to return to their workplaces in times of typhoons and heavy rain, in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said there’s a “holistic package” of support for brokers, especially smaller-sized firms, to put arrangements for remote working in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Technically we have the solutions ready in the market and the HKEx has already set out in the consultation document conclusions that they will provide necessary support in order to connect the potential service providers to the participants if they are needed,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Incentives are being given to the participants to upgrade themselves because for those that cannot do that before the end of September, if they need more time, we will support them through shouldering the relevant clearing responsibilities. At the same time, the regulators will pragmatically deal with their relevant compliance issues if they cannot during that period move everything online."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial services chief said people can draw on the experience of remote working during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Working from home or using technology or online, whatever systems are available to do all the arrangements, it's not something new to the market, and especially during Covid times when already certain members of our financial community are already doing that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what we are proposing here is not drastic change but rather incremental change which is contingent on experience that we get before.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that tests will be conducted in August to check market readiness, but noting that the official implementation will not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial industry on Tuesday welcomed the government's move to keep the local stock market open during typhoons and heavy rain storms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's stock market will continue trading under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robert Lee, who represents the financial services sector, said the new arrangement could enhance Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Lee, who is also a director of the Hong Kong Securities Association, called on authorities to offer more support to small and medium-sized financial institutions to help them adapt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The industry had been expecting it for quite some time now, especially it being mentioned in the Policy Address as well as the Budget. I think international firms and larger scale firms fully support this initiative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for some of the SMEs, or the local brokers, I would encourage the SAR government as well as HKEX to provide more assistance to them as they adapt to the new measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan said the industry now had sufficient time to prepare to operate in severe weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the right time to implement such kind of arrangement because during the last few years (of the) epidemic situation, a number of electronic trading systems and business solutions have been upgraded," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the implementation time will be this September, now we have sufficient time for us to effectively assist those smaller-scale firms to smoothly transition to the new arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Funds Association and accounting firm KPMG welcomed the new arrangement, saying it would put Hong Kong's bourse in line with other major markets on the mainland and overseas.

    Govt accuses association of 'harbouring fugitives'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757960_1_20240618162907.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has accused a charity that runs a college helping young people quit drugs of harbouring former directors on the police's wanted list.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In January, the authorities arrested four directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others who were not in Hong Kong were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday said narcotics officials have met the association's directors, but the board members' words do not match their actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities questioned the directors' claim that they have cut ties with former college head Alman Chan and founder Jacob Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, the two on the wanted list [Chan and Lam] are still directors of Christian Zheng Sheng Association Ltd and/or Zheng Sheng Charity Fund Limited under the association, and they can even operate the bank accounts under the association and its subsidiary companies," the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the board passed a motion not to recover millions of dollars the college had raised, which the two had allegedly transferred overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this is suspicious, and also shows that the board had no intention of helping students at the college.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said law enforcement officers will investigate the matter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s investment in critical minerals, clean energy and business links topped the agenda of Premier Li Qiang's visit to the Australian city of Perth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li said China's economy has continued to rebound and improve, with its new growth drivers gaining momentum, against the backdrop of sluggish global growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the final leg of his trip to Australia, the premier said China was planning major measures for further comprehensively deepening reform and steadily expanding institutional opening-up, and the country's business environment will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip to Perth, Li inspected iron ore miner Fortescue’s clean energy research facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fortescue’s chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company’s plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially “green iron”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think China chose us because it’s not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it’s the best technology to go green in the world and we’ve got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,” Forrest told The Associated Press before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we’re a great mining country, so by all means let’s go in harder after critical minerals, but let’s not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,” Forrest said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also visited Chinese-controlled Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia’s processing plant south of Perth to underscore China’s interest in investing in critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese flew to Perth from the national capital Canberra where the two leaders on Monday held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both attended a round table of business leaders in Perth representing resource companies including mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said business dialogue was essential to the bilateral relations between the two trading partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While there have been challenging times in the bilateral relationship between the two nations, I think it’s fair to say this is another positive point of progress,” Black told the meeting. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to approve a marriage equality bill, clearing the last legislative hurdle for the country to become the first in Southeast Asia to enact such a law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill passed its final reading with the approval of 130 of the 152 members of the Senate in attendance, with four voting against it and 18 abstaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill now needs the pro forma endorsement of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, followed by its publication in the Government Gazette, which would set a date within 120 days when it becomes effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand will become the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marriage equality bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through the House of Representatives right before the previous parliamentary session concluded in April. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to fight floods and droughts and ensure solid work in disaster relief to safeguard people's lives and property as well as social stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least nine people have been killed in southern China from heavy rains that triggered landslides, knocked out power for entire villages and buried crops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landslides triggered by severe flooding killed at least five people in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen others were missing, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four people were killed and two others were missing in Wuping county in Fujian province due to landslides caused by torrential rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Severe downpours started on Sunday afternoon, with authorities measuring 372.4 millimetres of rainfall over a 24-hour period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the southwestern Guizhou province, more than 1,100 people were evacuated due to flooding in several counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, northern parts of the country are battling drought, as the country faces two extremes of severe weather. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four varieties of watermelon will be featured at the upcoming Local Organic Watermelon Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual event, organised by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, kicks off on Friday at the Maritime Square Farmers Market in Tsing Yi, where people can buy local produce and interact with farmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four varieties featured this year include Super Sweet Black Angel 168, Diana, Huang Yu and seedless 3F-2728.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Mun-wai, an agricultural officer, said people could also purchase local produce through the Local Fresh website and app or through local farmers directly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added the festival aimed to promote local agriculture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The festival is to promote the local organic produce, to strengthen the sustainability of local agriculture, and to build a platform for the farmers to connect with the public and share their harvest with the public," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mrs Liang, a farmer, started growing watermelons last year and used a shed this year to minimise the weather's effects on crops, leading to a better harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that watermelons which were locally produced were fresher compared with imported watermelons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the morning we harvest the watermelons and in the afternoon they will be sold at the festival, so I hope everyone can support us farmers," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Accountancy giant KPMG on Tuesday said it has downgraded its expectations for Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) market this year, citing a global decline in dealmaking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  KPMG now expects to see up to 80 companies listing, raising HK$60 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, the accountancy firm had projected 90 listings, with revenue of HK$100 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, KPMG's Head of New Economy and Life Sciences Irene Chu said regional and global uncertainty is weighing on valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no shortage of companies that want to apply for an IPO... A lot of the time, it is about how attractive they are to investors," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is not as much about the local economic condition, it actually has a lot to do with the regional and global situation when it comes to interest rates and economic performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, Hong Kong saw 27 IPOs which raised HK$12 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was down from 31 listings with revenue of HK$18 billion in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KPMG said it expects Hong Kong will see more IPOs in the second half of the year thanks to the loosening of listing rules as well as supportive measures from the nation's market regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing earlier introduced the Chapter 18C listing regime, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, rolled out five measures to strengthen Hong Kong's status as a financial centre.

    Former Thai PM Thaksin indicted for insulting monarchy

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai prosecutors on Tuesday formally indicted influential former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra under the kingdom's strict royal insult laws over comments he made nearly a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, a powerful backer of the ruling government, was granted bail and avoided pre-trial detention for allegedly insulting the monarchy in a 2015 interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The billionaire sought bail from the Criminal Court of Thailand soon after the Attorney-General had formally charged him under Thailand's strict lese-majeste law, which carries a maximum jail sentence of up to 15 years for each perceived royal insult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin denies the charges against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court has released Thaksin on bail of 500,000 baht under the condition that he is prohibited from leaving the country unless granted permission," a court statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former policeman who went into the telecoms business and then entered politics, Thaksin returned to Thailand last year after 15 years in self-imposed exile following his ouster from power by a military coup in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin's was the first of four high-profile cases involving key political players that were before the courts on Tuesday, in the latest legal wrangling that could see Southeast Asia's second-largest economy plunged into a new period of uncertainty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cases involve some of Thailand's most powerful politicians, including its current prime minister, and could deepen a decades-old rift between the conservative-royalist establishment and its opponents, such as the populist ruling Pheu Thai party and the opposition Move Forward party.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong climbed two places to fifth in an annual global ranking of the world's most competitive economies, with an improved economic performance helping the SAR move up the table.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024 was unveiled by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development on Tuesday, after researchers assessed data from 67 countries and regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list ranked economies based on four main factors: economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong returns to fifth place mainly because of improvements in economic performance, business efficiency, and infrastructure. In government efficiency, it slightly drops from second to third," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report attributed Hong Kong's rise in economic performance, from 36th to 11th spot, to "steep increases" in the domestic economy and employment sub-factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city topped the rankings in the international trade and business legislation sub-categories, while placing within the top five in five other areas - international investment, tax policy, finance, basic infrastructure and education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hong Kong government spokesperson said the city's economy continued to recover after the pandemic, thanks to the "staunch support" from the central authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also noted the administration had introduced measures to boost market confidence and organised mega events to encourage tourism and spending, while working to attract overseas enterprises and talent to come to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the latest rankings were "a recognition of the brilliant achievements" of the SAR government, alongside local and foreign talent and enterprises, in the city's development and economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said high-quality talent and strategic companies from all over world had "voted with their feet" by coming to Hong Kong to seek opportunities, adding that officials had received more than 300,000 applications to various talent schemes by the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 120,000 people had arrived in Hong Kong, far beyond the initial target of attracting 35,000 per year, Chan added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore returned to the top spot for the first time since 2020, followed by Switzerland and Denmark, which placed first in the previous year's rankings. Mainland China climbed seven spots to place 14th.

 Jayson Tatum produced a dazzling 31-point display as the Boston Celtics dominated the Dallas Mavericks 106-88 to clinch a record-breaking 18th NBA championship crown on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Humbled by Dallas in a 38-point game four drubbing on Friday, Boston slammed the door on any chance of a Mavericks fightback to seal a 4-1 series victory at an electric TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tatum spearheaded a superb performance at both ends of the floor as Boston pulled clear of their arch-rival Los Angeles Lakers to stand alone with 18 NBA titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The emphatic win came 16 years to the day after Boston's last NBA Finals win – over the Lakers – in 2008. (AFP)

    Principal of closing school welcomes govt intervention

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The principal of a Wong Tai Sin school which is set to close in two years says she welcomes the Education Bureau’s decision to step in, adding that she hopes the bureau will clarify what a "management failure" means.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday evening, the bureau announced it will appoint managers to Confucian Tai Shing Primary School, citing a "management failure" at the institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's sponsoring body – the Confucian Academy – said over the weekend that the school will cease operations from the 2026-27 academic year and stop accepting primary one pupils from 2025-26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's principal, Yuen Poon Suk-han, told reporters on Tuesday that the academy is to blame for not consulting everyone involved regarding the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The problem now is the Confucian Academy fails to conduct extensive consultations with various stakeholders on the plan. So I hope the Education Bureau will clarify what management failure means, to prevent some people from making a big fuss and misleading the public," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some parents told RTHK they are disappointed by the closure and hope the government can provide help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My kids study in an English class. You know there are not many English primary schools available. The ones I can find are mostly Chinese primary schools. I asked my kids whether it's possible to switch back to a Chinese primary school and they said they are worried they can't handle it," said one parent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A primary five pupil said he hopes the closure can be delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm a bit unhappy. I wish the school could wait a few more years, maybe five, before closing down... I think the school offers a learning environment that other schools can't provide, because there are many recreational facilities," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors will still be able to trade in the city's financial market under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee made the announcement ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting, saying Hong Kong has no valid reason to stop the financial market operating during severe weather conditions, when other major financial hubs are able to continue trading in such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other securities markets around the world such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, they maintain trading even under severe weather conditions. Hong Kong is the only exception. Hong Kong is an international financial centre and there is no reason for us not to align with international standards," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the move would consolidate the competitiveness of HKEx and raise Hong Kong's role as a trading corridor with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing a public consultation exercise carried out by HKEx, Lee said about 90 percent of brokerages and banks support keeping the financial market open under severe weather conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the implementation date in late September will give the trade enough time to prepare, and the relevant authorities will offer support to small brokerages to cope with the change.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says airport officials followed their contingency procedures to handle an emergency that closed a runway for hours on Monday, with a plane operator asked to submit a report to the authorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of flights were delayed after a cargo plane experienced a flat tyre during an emergency landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive on Tuesday said the authorities kept the public informed, made alternative transport and flight arrangements, and brought in extra manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the plane's operator has been told to submit a report on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am a believer that, for any matter, there's always room for improvement. I'm glad that the incident was handled safely. That is the most important principle in any emergency incident, that's the number one priority," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will scrutinise reports and see whether any extra action can be taken by the airline, by the [Airport Authority] and other parties concerned."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that similar incidents could be dealt with more efficiently in the future when the airport's third runway is fully in operation at the end of this year.

 Several North Korean soldiers working near the heavily fortified border with the South were wounded in a landmine explosion, the Yonhap News Agency said Tuesday, citing Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korean military suffered multiple casualties due to a mine explosion during work," it said, without giving further details. The border between the two countries is heavily mined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's military said the explosions came after dozens of North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the border but retreated after Seoul's military fired warning shots.
  <br/>

  It was the second such incursion in two weeks. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka and three-time Grand Slam runner up Ons Jabeur say they will not compete at this year's Paris Olympics in order to prioritise their health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Especially with all the struggles I've been struggling with the last months, I feel I have to take care of my health," Sabalenka told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tennis events at this summer's Games take place on clay between July 27-August 4, meaning a switch back to clay immediately after the grass season and before the hard-court run up to the U.S. Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belarus' Sabalenka, 26, lost to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the French Open quarter-finals earlier this month.
  <br/>

  She is set to return to action this week in Berlin, having suffered from a stomach illness at Roland-Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was the worst experience I had in my life on court," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tunisian Jabeur, 29, underwent surgery last year on her right knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After consulting with my medical team regarding attending to the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeapordize the rest of my season," Jabeur said on her social media accounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Olympics," she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Otago Highlanders back Connor Garden-Bachop has died aged 25 after an unspecified "medical event", New Zealand Rugby said Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Connor passed away on Monday following a medical event, and rugby's collective focus at this time is on supporting his family," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement without giving further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, the son of former All Black Stephen Bachop, played for the Highlanders in this season's Super Rugby competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winger, who also played representative rugby for the Maori All Blacks, comes from a family of New Zealand internationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His mother, Susan Garden-Bachop, played for New Zealand's Black Ferns, while his uncle Graeme Bachop also played for the All Blacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, who was the father of twin girls, made his debut for the Highlanders in 2021, going on to make 30 appearances in Super Rugby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had said he was one of several players not returning next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent post on social media platform Instagram, Garden-Bachop praised the Dunedin-based team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you @highlandersteam for an unforgettable five years," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to everyone in the south for making me feel at home, and thank you to the boys I have been honoured to share the field with, it's been a pleasure, I will miss you all. Till next time." (AFP)

    Mbappe breaks nose as France win Euro 2024 opener

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kylian Mbappe leaves the pitch with what turned out to be a broken nose. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757872_1_20240618064027.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe came off late on with a broken nose as France edged Austria 1-0 in their opening game at Euro 2024 on Monday, after Slovakia inflicted a surprise 1-0 defeat on Belgium and Romania beat Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France, the runners-up at the 2022 World Cup, are one of the standout contenders for European Championship glory in Germany, but they did not entirely convince against a hard-running Austria side and needed a Maximilian Woeber own goal to claim the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defender Woeber diverted Mbappe's cutback into his own net seven minutes before half-time in Duesseldorf to decide the Group D game and leave France level on three points at the top of the section with the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe may have made the goal, but it was otherwise a difficult night for the new Real Madrid signing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was denied twice by Austrian goalkeeper Patrick Pentz in the first half and failed to hit the target from a glorious chance when sent clean through 10 minutes after the restart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe then had to come off in the 90th minute after being left with a bloodied nose in an accidental collision with Austrian defender Kevin Danso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source close to the France captain confirmed shortly after the game that his nose was broken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium may no longer rank among the leading contenders but they were not expected to start with a defeat against Slovakia in Frankfurt, where Ivan Schranz of Slavia Prague scored the only goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schranz struck in the seventh minute, firing home the rebound after Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels had saved from Juraj Kucka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an especially frustrating day for Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku, who missed a host of chances and had a late equaliser controversially disallowed by VAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had already had one effort ruled out for a marginal offside call before he swept home a Lois Openda cutback in the 86th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, however, the goal was disallowed because the ball had brushed Openda's hand at the beginning of the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania won at a major international tournament for the first time in 24 years as they beat Ukraine 3-0 with the help of two errors from goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Nicolae Stanciu's magnificent long-range strike – following a misplaced Lunin clearance – gave Romania, backed by the vast majority of the Munich crowd, a first-half lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Razvan Marin's shot from distance then skipped under Lunin as Romania turned the screw with two more goals before the hour, Denis Dragus tapping home the third. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks began the week on a strong note, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finishing at records spurred on by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq led the major indices, climbing 1.0 percent to 17,857, a closing record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones climbed 0.5 percent to 38,778, while the S&P 500 also finished at an all-time high, rising 0.8 percent to 5,473.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not a broad rally but it's a rally with the index up for sure," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, who pointed to recent share price gains of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia as a source of momentum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan also noted that the outlook for US monetary policy had improved somewhat following last week's US inflation data, which kept alive the chance of interest rate cuts in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's calendar includes the release of US retail sales data, as well a Bank of England policy meeting.

  Markets will be closed on Wednesday to mark the Juneteenth National Independence Day. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The crash took place in the Phansidewa area of Darjeeling district in West Bengal, when the Kanchenjunga Express train was hit by the goods train. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757860_1_20240618025544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed in India on Monday when a goods train driver missed a signal and slammed into an express passenger train from behind, police and railway officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three passenger carriages were derailed and flipped on their side, while one carriage was thrust high into the air, precariously balanced on another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident in West Bengal state is the latest to hit India's creaking rail network, which carries millions of passengers each day – and the most recent reported failure of drivers missing basic signals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 people were injured and taken to hospital, Jaya Varma Sinha, chairman of India's Railway Board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A goods train disregarded the signal and hit the train from behind," Sinha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included the driver and co-driver, who missed the signal, as well as a train guard and five passengers, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinha said the casualties could have been worse, but a guard wagon and two others carrying post that were attached to the back of the passenger train took the brunt of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were two parcel carriages attached... which protected other carriages from extensive damage," she said, but added that the guard wagon "was badly damaged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash took place in the Phansidewa area of Darjeeling district, when the Kanchenjunga Express train was hit by the goods train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to "those who lost their loved ones," in a post on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called the crash "tragic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments after the collision, she said that "ambulances and disaster teams" were rushed to the site, giving orders for "action on a war footing" to be initiated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local police officer Iftikar-Ul-Hassan said he saw several badly injured people pulled out of the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The toll could rise further, as four people are admitted in a serious condition," he said, adding that rescue teams were working to return the line to service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tracks are being cleared and restored for operations," he added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='French football star Kylian Mbappe says he is "against extremes and divisive ideas." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757857_1_20240618012819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's sports minister, Amelie Oudea-Castera, on Monday hailed as exemplary a statement by football superstar Kylian Mbappe urging voters not to back extremes in snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron to combat the far right.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mbappe, representing France at the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, said he was "against extremes and divisive ideas" and urged young people to vote at a "crucial moment" in French history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments from Mbappe, 25, one of the icons of modern France, have sparked a stream of controversy, with figures on the right warning him against interfering in politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kylian spoke in an absolutely exemplary manner yesterday (Sunday). He wanted to speak to young people at a totally unprecedented and decisive moment for the future," of the country, said Oudea-Castera.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's men's football team has long been seen as a beacon for diversity in the country. The French Football Federation has urged against "any form of pressure and political use of the French team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I will still be proud to wear this shirt after July 7," said Mbappe, referring to the second round of the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The striker defended comments made on Saturday by his teammate Marcus Thuram, saying he "had not gone too far" in calling on the country "to fight every day to stop" the RN winning the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we can all see that extremists are very close to winning power and we have the opportunity to choose the future of our country," Mbappe said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, several dozen French sports personalities including tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and athlete Marie-Jose Perec also called for a vote against the far right, in an op-ed for L'Equipe sports daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see that our athletes want to make their voices heard," added Oudea-Castera, herself a former professional tennis player, as she attended rehearsals for the Olympics opening ceremony on the River Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an attitude that is courageous, committed, and that can be applauded, that is deeply respectable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former French football star Thierry Henry, now coach of the French Olympic team, also added his voice, urging voters to "block the extremes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there is something that is still important, what can block the extremes is to go and vote. So go and vote," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally, I am against anything that divides and a little more for anything that can unite," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) may win the largest number of votes in the election but may struggle to form an overall majority. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The France scrum-half says he very much doubts "that there is only one gay on the pitch." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757854_1_20240618002639.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The star of French rugby and pin-up for this summer's Paris Olympics Antoine Dupont has called for an end to the "macho" cliches linked to the game and "stop homophobia in our sport."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old, who was World Rugby men's 15s Player of the Year in 2021, made the comment in an interview in the next edition of the French LGBTQ magazine Tetu, to be published on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one professional rugby player in France, Jeremy Clamy-Edroux who plays for third division Rouen, has publicly declared his homosexuality but Dupont said there were certainly more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I very much doubt that there is only one gay on the pitch!" the Toulouse and France scrum-half said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal is for all players to feel good about their sexuality and to be accepted by others."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if rugby can be seen as macho, we are very open-minded, and today I think we are all capable of accepting each other's sexual orientations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really need to repeat it, communicate about it, so that everyone definitely feels comfortable with it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupont captained France in last year's World Cup and is poised to line up for the sevens team at this summer's Games. (AFP)

    Prague extradites Indian murder plot suspect to US
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The intended vicitm of the alleged murder plot is a Sikh separatist who supports the Khalistan movement. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757851_1_20240617234247.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech police said on Monday that an Indian citizen suspected of involvement in an alleged plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States had been extradited there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Justice Department charged the man, identified as Nikhil Gupta, in November with plotting to assassinate a Sikh separatist leader on US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged an Indian government official was also involved in planning the plot to kill the person, a US citizen of Indian origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Sikhs support the Khalistan movement, that wants an independent homeland in the northern Indian province of Punjab, which Indian authorities strongly oppose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has cracked down on the movement while denying involvement in the targeting of pro-Khalistan activists outside India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The foreigner suspected in the United States of an assassination plot has been in the hands of the US judiciary since Friday," Czech police said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that Gupta was "safely extradited from a Prague airport," posting video images of the man being escorted into a plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gupta was detained at Prague airport on June 30, 2023, under extradition orders issued by the US Justice Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said the man allegedly targeted in the killing "is a vocal critic of the Indian government and leads a US-based organisation that advocates for the secession of Punjab."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was elected to a third term this month, had vowed to "look into" the case while visiting the United States in late 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's foreign ministry has said it created a "high-level" inquiry committee to investigate the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, The Washington Post reported in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A similar case in Canada has meanwhile sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada arrested and charged four Indian nationals in May over their alleged role in the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a separatist Sikh leader, in Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, had advocated for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wanted by Indian authorities for alleged "terrorism" and conspiracy to commit murder – allegations he denied – Nijjar was shot and killed on June 18, 2023, outside the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had "credible allegations" connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India dismissed the allegations as "absurd" and responded by briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Monday said it will appoint managers to the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School, which is set to close in two years, citing ineffective management at the institution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sponsoring body of the Wong Tai Sin school – the Confucian Academy – announced over the weekend that the school would cease operations from the 2026-27 academic year and stop accepting primary one pupils from 2025-26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press conference on Monday, the school's principal Yuen Poon Suk-han said she and the management committee were not consulted on the academy's decision to suspend the school beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the academy said the school's chancellor had informed its managers and principal in April, and that the decision was "carefully considered".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, the bureau said it had met with the school's principal and sponsoring body multiple times and that the two parties had failed to reach a consensus on a transition plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it will appoint managers to the school to ensure that it is managed properly and that the closure aligns with existing mechanisms and procedures.

    Putin to make 'friendly' visit to North Korea

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to North Korea on Tuesday for a "friendly" visit, the Kremlin announced, as the West suspects Pyongyang of supplying Moscow with weapons for its Ukraine offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit to the world's most reclusive state comes as Putin seeks ammunition to continue his military campaign launched in February 2022, which has thrown Moscow into unprecedented global isolation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also comes nine months after Putin hosted North Korea's Kim Jong Un on a rare foreign trip to the Russian Far East, where the pair lavished each other with praise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Vladimir Putin on June 18-19 will go to the North Korean Democratic Republic on a friendly state visit," the Kremlin said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said Putin will then travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's few key allies such as China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang rarely hosts foreign guests, isolated diplomatically and having shut itself off even more since the Covid pandemic. (AFP)

    Govt announces strategy on hydrogen development

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced its strategy on hydrogen development, saying it is to address climate change and help achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony, officials said 14 trial projects are in the pipeline, such as using hydrogen to power street-cleaning vehicles and to generate electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the strategy is an important milestone that will help build a carbon-free city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we are pursuing carbon neutrality, it is necessary for us to acquire what we call the zero-carbon energy in order to support the green transition. Hydrogen is one of the zero-carbon energies,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe that hydrogen has a great potential to develop a new green economy in Hong Kong, because its production, its storage and also its application in different sectors will enhance the employment of labour and the setting up of new industry,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that changes to the law will be proposed in the first half of next year to ensure safe storage and supply of the highly combustible gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR already has a hydrogen double-decker bus and the MTR will trial a hydrogen-powered light rail vehicle later this year.

    China says G7 statement 'arrogant and prejudiced'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday hit back at a G7 end-of-summit statement that took aim at China, accusing it of being "full of arrogance, prejudice and lies".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The G7 summit statement once again manipulated China-related issues, slandered and attacked China, rehashed cliches that have no factual basis, no legal basis, and no moral justification, and are full of arrogance, prejudice and lies," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Group of Seven leaders met last week in Italy, souring trade relations with Beijing as well as tensions over Ukraine and the South China Sea were a focus of their discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement released at the end of the summit said China was sending dual-use materials to Russia which were helping Moscow's war in Ukraine. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his country's six-member war cabinet, in a widely expected move that came after the departure from government of the centrist former general Benny Gantz.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was now expected to hold consultations about the Gaza war with a small group of ministers, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer who had been in the war cabinet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister had faced demands from the nationalist-religious partners in his coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to be included in the war cabinet, a move which would have intensified strains with international partners including the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forum was formed after Gantz joined Netanyahu in a national unity government at the start of the Gaza war in October and also included Gantz's partner Gadi Eisenkot and Aryeh Deri, head of the religious party Shas, as observers. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Monday afternoon said that the north runway at Chek Lap Kok was up and running again after a cargo plane, that had burst a tyre, was towed away at around 3 pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jet made an emergency landing at around 7:30 am, forcing the closure of the runway for almost eight hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one runway remained in operation, and around 450 flights were delayed as a result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers said their itineraries were badly affected, with some complaining that they had missed their onward connections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said even though both runways had since resumed operation, some flights could still be disrupted as a backlog was being cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged passengers to keep tabs on the latest flight information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Monday evening the Airport Authority said the Airport Express Link would run more frequently after midnight, with the last train to Hong Kong Station departing at 1:30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said the airport's Automated People Mover System and customer service counters would stay open until 3 am.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Monday said tourists made nearly 3.4 million trips to Hong Kong in May, a 20 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said initial figures show that some 2.6 million trips were made by mainlanders, which was a 15 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trips by travellers from outside the mainland jumped by some 43 percent, to more than 771,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cumulatively, a total of 18 million visitors arrived in Hong Kong from January to May this year, increasing by 80 percent from the same period last year," the board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The border between Hong Kong and the mainland fully reopened in early February last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the DAB said Hong Kong can consider making use of its culture of martial arts novels and TV series to attract tourists, together with fellow Greater Bay Area cities like Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party vice-chairman Holden Chow told reporters the SAR can think about hosting activities around "intangible assets", like novels written by the late Jin Yong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they are still very attractive to many people around the world, including those from South East Asia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday said it had launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork and pork by-products from the European Union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce has opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of relevant pork and pig by-products originating from the European Union," the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation would begin on June 17, the ministry said, and was prompted by a complaint submitted by the China Animal Husbandry Association on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry said the investigation should be completed by June 17, 2025, but could be extended by another six months if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the European Commission's June 12 announcement that it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from July, global food companies have been on high alert for retaliatory tariffs from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities on the mainland had previously dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. (Agencies)

    No civil servant tests on security laws: govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ingrid Yeung told lawmakers there will be national security training, but not examinations, for new and existing government workers." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757780_1_20240617140633.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said there are no plans to test government workers on how familiar they are with national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of tests was brought up by lawmakers at a Legco panel meeting to discuss the updated Civil Service Code, which sets resolutely safeguarding national security as a core value of government staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said there will be plenty of national security training for new and existing government workers, but not examinations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Training is about integrity and attitude. You can't really test that in an examination," she told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, you can ask them to quote many examples, but can they actually deliver? That's more important. That's why we will assess their day-to-day performance and their conduct as we appraise colleagues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The updated code also states that in their official capacity, civil servants cannot criticise any government policies or support opposing views, and they must be loyal to the chief executive of the day and the Central People's Government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Siu-chung, from the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, asked for clarity on this, saying it's hard to know when someone is speaking whether it's in their official or personal capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He argued that if government workers are not allowed to make public criticism in a personal capacity, it may not be good for overall governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said this is something for civil servants to work out for themselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that if a policy is in the consultation stage, government workers can speak more freely, but once a decision is made they should be extra careful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same meeting, lawmakers also discussed a planned across-the-board three percent pay rise for civil servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung dismissed a claim from the federation's Lam Chun-sing that the government has been under pressure from employers to keep rises in check, so that private sector staff don't demand bigger increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister reiterated that the latest pay decision was made based on several factors, including the government's budget deficit.

    Consumer watchdog warns of hidden fees at pet hotels

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pet owners should study the fine print carefully when choosing a lodging for their furry friends and avoid those which are unlicensed, according to the Consumer Council.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council randomly selected 18 licensed pet hotels across Hong Kong for study earlier this year. Only five had their fee structures published online, meaning consumers had to make enquiries, a process which could be tedious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different operators also had varying charging schemes. Some charged up to double the normal rate during peak periods such as the Lunar New Year holiday, while the administering of medicines or nutritional supplements all came at a cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the event of injury, illness or even death, only four hotels would provide compensation of between HK$300 and HK$5,000. Eight others stated they would assume no legal liability through disclaimers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart form urging pet hotel operators to be more transparent in their fee structures, the watchdog also hoped the government could amend the rules so that all licensed animal boarding providers were published on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, the council conducted a survey of private camping sites in Hong Kong and found that nearly 40 percent of them were suspected of operating illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only three of the 22 venues covered in the study carried a proper licence or compliance certificate to operate a holiday camp. Authorities were verifying if any operator had breached rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council also studied another seven "glamping" sites which provide extra amenities. Only three were covered by third-party liability insurance, meaning people staying at other sites may not have adequate protection in case of emergencies or accidents.

    Government plans to raise university tuition fees

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Monday said the government plans to raise university tuition fees in the next few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local undergraduate students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions pay an annual tuition fee of HK$42,100 – an amount that has remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Choi said a fee increase for such students will be implemented in stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After all these years... there's been 40 percent inflation, but we haven't raised tuition fees at all. So we think it's time for a review and to maintain fiscal discipline," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the government will make an announcement in advance so that universities can introduce more grants and bursaries for students in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the minister said she expects more institutions to offer applied degree programmes that combine theory and practical skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his policy address last year to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education and to facilitate the establishment of universities of applied sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that each university has its own strengths, so there should be a division of labour regarding the courses they offer in the future.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of rush-hour commuters had to be evacuated from an MTR train on Monday morning, after a 40-centimetre snake was seen slithering through one of the carriages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they were notified at around 7:30am that a black and white snake was spotted on a Tsuen Wan Line train that was approaching Admiralty station from Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All passengers were asked to disembark at Admiralty, and no one was injured in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A snake catcher was called in soon after, and the serpent – believed to be a nonvenomous California Kingsnake – was captured and sent to Kadoorie Farm.

    Better labelling for air purifiers needed: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called on manufacturers of air purifiers to clearly indicate how much clean air their products can deliver per minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said clearly stating the clean air delivery rate would help buyers make better choices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council tested 10 air purifiers, and found big differences in their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best performing model was 12.3 times better than the worst at removing formaldehyde, while variations in their effectiveness in removing smoke ranged up to 2.7 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said the clean air delivery rate could act as a convenient metric for consumers to compare different air purifier models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because the standards of filtration is quite different among different countries, no matter it is dust or pollens or cigarette smoke, it's quite diverse,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is easier for consumers to compare based on the CADR - the clean air delivery rate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health reminded consumers to clean their purifiers regularly to minimise the risk of diseases, while the Hong Kong Medical Association reminded people to maintain air circulation by keeping windows open to ensure indoor air quality.

    China-Australia ties on the right track: Li Qiang

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Premier Li Qiang, right, shakes hands with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at Parliament House in Canberra.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's relationship with Australia is on the right track, Premier Li Qiang said in Canberra on Monday as the two trading partners moved on from their economic dispute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Australia since 2017, Li held high-level talks with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese following a welcome ceremony at Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In less than one year Prime Minister Albanese and I have met multiple times and exchanged visits to each other's country," Li said following their meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This shows that our countries attach great importance to our relationship and that this relationship is on the right track of steady improvement and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said he and Albanese had a "candid exchange of views on some differences and disagreements", and the two countries have agreed to properly manage those differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier added the further development of bilateral ties requires joint efforts from both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his opening remarks, Albanese said China and Australia had complementary economies and shared interests in addressing climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have our differences... that's why candid dialogue is so important. For Australia, we consistently advocate the importance of a region and world that is peaceful, stable and prosperous, where countries respect sovereignty and abide by international laws," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia advocates that we should all work together to promote a regional balance where no country dominates and no country is dominated.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting in 2020, a slew of Australia's most lucrative export commodities were effectively banned from China as diplomatic relations rapidly unravelled. But as ties have gradually improved under a new government in Canberra, Beijing has wound back most of these trade barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains overwhelmingly Australia's largest trading partner. Australian farmers, miners and exporters are already seeing the benefits of the removal of trade impediments – benefits that flow to our economy," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also described the discussions with Li as constructive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier Li also said the two countries would expand cooperation in energy and mining, and China would include Australia in its visa waiver programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the two sides will take steps to improve military communication to avoid incidents. "One of the very practical measures that we spoke about was improving military-to-military communication so as to avoid incidents," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an incident last month, a Chinese air force jet dropped flares near an Australian defence helicopter in international airspace over the Yellow Sea. Canberra called it a dangerous encounter whereas the Foreign Ministry in Beijing accused the Australian military of provocative and threatening behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li visited New Zealand before Australia and is scheduled to stop in Malaysia on Tuesday before returning to China. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said on Monday morning there could be disruptions to flights in and out of Hong Kong for a few hours due to the closure of the north runway.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The closure followed an emergency landing by a cargo plane at around 7:30am, during which the jet experienced a flat tyre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said only one runway remained in operation for the time being, and flights schedules may be affected.

    China retail sales strong in May, but output lags

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows improving consumer sentiment, although industrial output lagged expectations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757755_1_20240617113531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales figures in May, a major indicator of consumption sentiment, rose 3.7 percent year on year to 3.92 trillion yuan, accelerating from a 2.3 percent increase in April and marking the quickest rate of growth since February.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newly released data on Monday from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also showed that retail sales climbed 4.1 percent year on year in the first five months of 2024, to hit 19.52 trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected retail sales to grow three percent due to the five-day public holiday earlier in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, industrial output on the mainland lagged expectations with the property sector still weak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial data released by the NBS came in below expectations for a six percent increase, with output rising only 5.6 percent year on year in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded four percent in the first five months of 2024 from the same period a year earlier, versus expectations for a 4.2 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It grew 4.2 percent in the January to April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS also reported that China's raw coal output fell three percent year on year to 1.86 billion tonnes in the first five months of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May alone, the country's raw coal output stood at 380 million tonnes, down 0.8 percent year on year, although the decline was 2.1 percentage points narrower than in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's property market downturn, high local government debt and deflation remained heavy drags on economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures point to an uneven growth pattern that reinforced calls for more fiscal and monetary policy support from the central government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With narrowing interest margins and a weakening currency remaining key constraints limiting Beijing's scope to ease monetary policy, China's central bank left a key policy rate unchanged as expected on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's second-largest economy grew faster than expected at 5.3 percent in the first quarter, but analysts said the government's around five percent annual growth target was ambitious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's exports grew faster than expected in May helped by improved global demand, but growth in imports slowed significantly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tepid demand at home has also kept a lid on consumer prices as confidence remains low in the face of a protracted property sector crisis while new bank lending rebounded less than expected in May. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight people have died of suffocation in a refrigerated truck in Henan province, a local investigation team said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They were found unconscious when the vehicle arrived at a petrol station on Saturday evening in Hongzhuangyang Township in Yexian County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victims were confirmed dead in the small hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the eight had stayed in the insulated compartment of the vehicle, which was against regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear if they were Chinese nationals or foreigners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The truck driver and other "responsible personnel" have been detained, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the case was being investigated. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly minted world record-holder Gretchen Walsh punched her ticket to the Paris Olympics on Sunday with a victory in the women's 100 metres butterfly in a swift time of 55.31 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old American couldn't match the astonishing 55.18 she threw down in the semi-finals of the US Olympic swimming trials to shatter Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem's previous mark of 55.48 -- but she clocked the second-fastest time ever and secured a berth at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still in shock," Walsh said. "I don't even know what to say. Making the team was the biggest goal, but getting a world record was absolutely insanity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh's mark in the butterfly on Saturday was the third world record set in women's swimming over the past couple of months, coming on the back of Canadian Summer McIntosh's effort in the 400 metres individual medley and Australian star Ariarne Titmus' blistering time in the 200 metres freestyle.
