<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazil's Vinicius Jr scored twice in his side's 4-1 Copa America victory over Paraguay in a Group D clash in Nevada on Friday, bouncing back from a lacklustre display in his first game of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Colombia, who have qualified for the quarter-finals, top Group D with six points after two matches, with Brazil in second on four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costa Rica are third with one point and Paraguay, who are bottom with zero after two defeats, have been eliminated from the competition in the group stage for only the second time since 2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This victory marked Brazil's first win in six competitive matches and their maiden competitive win under the management of Dorival Jr, who took charge of the team in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the whistle, Vinicius' pace and trickery posed a constant threat to Paraguay down the left flank, a far cry from his performance in Brazil's 0-0 draw with Costa Rica in their opening group stage match, in which he was largely ineffectual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Brazil's strong start, it was Paraguay who almost went ahead in the 15th minute as Damian Bobadilla's goal-bound effort took a massive deflection off Eder Militao and nearly wrongfooted Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who showed quick reflexes to keep out the strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil earned a 28th-minute penalty for a handball, which was fired wide by Lucas Paqueta, but the midfielder made up for his miss seven minutes later as he set up Vinicius with a first-time pass to cap off a flowing team move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girona winger Savio doubled Brazil's advantage after pouncing on a rebound inside the box, before Vinicius stuck out a boot to divert a clearance from Omar Alderete into the net for his second goal of the night in first half stoppage time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paraguay got a goal back after the break as Alderete netted a superb long-range, but any hopes of a comeback were swiftly dashed when Brazil were awarded a penalty in the 68th minute after a handball by Mathias Villasanti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his earlier miss, Paqueta stepped up and made no mistake at the second time of asking to send Brazil's fans at the Allegiant Stadium into delirium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Towards the end of the match, tempers flared and Andres Cubas was shown a red card after kicking out at Douglas Luiz, with Brazil using their man's advantage to comfortably see out the game and clinch the three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In particular the first half, up to the 40 minutes, it was very even," Paraguay coach Daniel Garnero told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we created some opportunities. Unfortunately, in the three minutes we got a bit distracted and they scored two goals that made a great difference in the result. And Vinicius is an elite player, no doubt about it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil next face group leaders Colombia in California on Tuesday, where a draw would be enough to secure qualification for the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paraguay face Costa Rica, who retain a slim chance of progressing to the quarter-finals, in Texas. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government will adjust fees for Accident and Emergency departments, based on factors such as public affordability and social acceptance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, he said the financial burden on patients suffering from major illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, could be huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo told reporters that officials are mulling a cap on medical fees paid by severely ill patients and increasing subsidies for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Considering the major illnesses, a very common example these days will be patients with cancer. It's actually a major burden for the patient and for the family as well. Because with the advance in healthcare, especially in cancer treatment, some of these medications can be very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though most of us believe that we are healthy and want ourselves to be healthy... One day we may have a major illness like cancer or a stroke and we want to ensure that the current healthcare system in Hong Kong can provide a safety net for these people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lo said an independent committee set up by the Hospital Authority (HA) to review a spate of medical blunders comprises members from various backgrounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister said the list of committee members, which includes patient organisations, people with experience in managing medical systems and handling medical equipment, will be announced shortly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered a comprehensive and systemic review at the HA after a series of medical incidents and issues with equipment at public hospitals.

    Suspected coup leaders remanded in custody

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This screen shot from a handout video of BOLIVIA TV, shows Bolivia's dismissed army commander Juan Jose Zuniga being arrested. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759556_1_20240629103544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three suspected leaders of a failed coup against Bolivian President Luis Arce were remanded in custody on Friday for six months, the country's top prosecutor said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former army chief Juan Jose Zuniga, former head of navy Juan Arnez and Alejandro Irahola, former head of the army's mechanized brigade, will be held in a high-security prison not far from the capital La Paz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This pre-trial detention ordered by the judge will undoubtedly set a precedent, and is a good signal for the investigation to move forward," said Attorney General Cesar Siles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three officers face charges of engaging in an armed uprising and terrorism and face up to 20 years in prison, Siles said on state television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 21 active, retired and civilian military personnel were arrested in connection with Wednesday's attempted coup, in which troops and tanks were deployed in the heart of the capital, where they tried to break down a door of the presidential palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuniga said his goal was to "restructure democracy" in Bolivia. He was soon captured and the troops pulled back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an unusual twist, Zuniga claimed he was following Arce's orders and that the president had hoped for the coup to trigger a crackdown that would boost his popularity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arce denied the allegations. "How could one order or plan a coup on one's self?" he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions in the Andean nation have been rising in recent weeks over surging prices, shortages of dollars and fuel, and a feud between Arce and powerful former president Evo Morales ahead of the 2025 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced Thursday that he would soon visit his "friend" Arce to support him following the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia "strongly" condemned the attempted military coup, its foreign ministry said Thursday, warning against "destructive foreign interference" in the South American country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres "welcomes the peaceful resolution of the situation," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, having earlier expressed alarm over the abortive coup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Condemnations of the coup bid also poured in from Madrid, Washington and across Latin America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolivia, which has a long history of military coups, has in recent weeks been rocked by an economic crisis due to a drop in natural gas production, its main source of foreign currency until 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country has had to reduce fuel imports, and there is a shortage of dollars, which has triggered protests by powerful unions of merchants and freight transporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government at Cornell University in New York state, told AFP the failed coup was "a symptom of a significant and broad discontent" in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, "we must carefully evaluate how widespread the discontent is within the armed forces," he said, adding that Arce's government was facing "a critical moment of weakness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolivia is also deeply polarized after years of political instability, and the ruling Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party is riven by internal conflict between supporters of Arce and his former mentor Morales. (AFP)

    Buffett donates US$5bn of Berkshire stock

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest donation, announced on Friday, included about 13 million Berkshire Class B shares. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759548_1_20240629095627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett donated another US$5.3 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities, his biggest annual donation since he began making them in 2006.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Buffett's donation boosted his overall giving to the charities to about US$57 billion, including to the family charities in the last two Novembers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest donation, announced on Friday, included about 13 million Berkshire Class B shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett donated 9.93 million shares to the Gates Foundation, and has donated more than US$43 billion of Berkshire shares there overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also donated 993,035 shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and 695,122 shares to each of three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the NoVo Foundation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett, 93, plans to give away more than 99% of the fortune he built at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which he has run since 1965, with his children serving as executors of his will.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berkshire is an approximately $880 billion conglomerate that owns dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and stocks such as Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett still owns 14.5 percent of Berkshire's outstanding shares, a Friday regulatory filing shows, despite having given away more than half of his stock since 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His US$128.4 billion fortune makes him the world's 10th-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Buffett said he was worth about US$44 billion when the donations began, but that the benefits of compounding, "simple and generally sound capital deployment" at Berkshire, and the "American tailwind" produced his current wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates also pioneered the Giving Pledge, in which 245 people like OpenAI's Sam Altman, Michael Bloomberg, Carl Icahn, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg committed at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation works in reproductive health. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation works to alleviate hunger, mitigate conflicts including in Ukraine, and improve public safety. The Sherwood Foundation supports Nebraska nonprofits, and the NoVo Foundation has initiatives focused on girls and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's filing suggests based on Buffett's holdings that Berkshire has repurchased little or none of its own stock since April 19. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759547_1_20240629093722.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombia marched into the quarter-finals of the Copa America on Friday with a confident 3-0 victory over Costa Rica in Arizona.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Luis Diaz, Davinson Sanchez and Jhon Cordoba sealed all three points for the Colombians, who are now guaranteed a top two-finish in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game next Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Colombians will head into that game brimming with confidence after extending their unbeaten streak to 25 games at Glendale's State Farm Stadium on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nestor Lorenzo's well-organised side have not lost since a defeat to Argentina in February 2022, and never looked like surrendering that record on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool star Diaz opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after Costa Rica goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira inexplicably crashed into Jhon Cordoba on the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diaz stepped up to smash an emphatic spot-kick into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia almost doubled their tally on 37 minutes, with veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picking out Diaz at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diaz poked a cross into the six-yard area but center-back Davinson Sanchez just couldn't get a touch to guide the ball into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made no such mistake in the 59th minute, however, as he glanced in Jhon Arias's cross from the left to make it 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cordoba then grabbed Colombia's third on 62 minutes with the best goal of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exquisite through ball from Rodriguez split the Costa Rica defence and sent Cordoba racing in on goal, the 31-year-old whipping a shot across goal into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Friday's other Copa America game, Brazil take on Paraguay in Las Vegas hoping to get their first win of the tournament after an opening 0-0 draw with Costa Rica. (AFP)

 America's most influential newspaper, The New York Times, called in an editorial on Friday for President Joe Biden to step aside and allow another Democrat to challenge Donald Trump for the White House in November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Describing Biden as "the shadow of a great public servant," the newspaper's editorial board - which is separate from its newsroom - said Thursday's debate between the president and Trump proved the 81-year-old "failed his own test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His determination to run again is a "reckless gamble," it said, adding: "the greatest public service Mr Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election." (AFP)

    River Seine fails water quality tests before Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The river Seine is still failing water quality tests one month before the Paris Olympics when it is scheduled to host the open-water swimming competition and the swimming leg of the triathlon, results showed Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latest tests, completed last week and released by the Paris mayor's office, showed levels of the E.Coli bacteria – an indicator of faecal matter – are far above the upper limits imposed by sports federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water quality remains degraded because of unfavourable hydrological conditions, little sunshine, below-average seasonal temperatures and upstream pollution," the mayor's office said in a statement.
  <br/>

  French authorities have spent 1.4 billion euros (US$1.5 billion) in the last decade trying to clean up the river by improving the Paris sewerage system, as well as building new water treatment and storage facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But major storms still overwhelm the capital's waste water network, some of which dates back to the 19th century, leading to discharges of untreated sewage directly into the river.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Arab Emirates has shortened Friday sermons at mosques to protect worshippers from severe heat, amid rising summer temperatures linked to climate change.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The General Authority of Islamic Affairs ordered preachers to limit Friday sermons to 10 minutes from June to October, when temperatures cool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sermons usually last for 20 minutes for the main weekly prayers on Fridays but can run even longer, with large crowds gathering outside mosques at midday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was aimed at ensuring "the safety of worshippers... especially during the summer months", the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It coincides with UAE authorities' efforts to avoid heat strokes and other complications as temperatures approach 50 degrees Celsius in parts of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From June until September, the UAE prohibits work under direct sunlight and in open-air areas between noon and 3pm as part of a longstanding "midday break" policy widely adopted across the Gulf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The desert region, already one of the world's hottest, faces rising threats from high temperatures attributed to climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, more than 1,300 people died while performing the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia during intense heat, according to Saudi authorities. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French authorities said gatherings in the Pacific territory of New Caledonia would be banned this weekend and a curfew extended, weeks after deadly riots and as the country prepares for high-stakes snap polls starting Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France is on tenterhooks ahead of a two-round vote which could see the anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic far right take the largest number of seats in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first round takes place on Sunday, followed by a second round on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Commission, which represents the French state in the archipelago, announced a ban on gatherings from Saturday morning until Sunday evening in New Caledonia, which was hit by the deadly unrest last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-May, rioting and looting erupted in New Caledonia over an electoral reform plan that Indigenous Kanak people feared would leave them in a permanent minority, putting independence hopes definitively out of reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Commission also said that the 8.00pm to 6.00am curfew in place since the start of the riots had been extended until July 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High Commissioner Louis Le Franc noted that the situation "had improved", but pointed out that public infrastructure had recently sustained "very serious damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 1,500 people have been arrested since the unrest began in New Caledonia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence has left nine dead and damage estimated at more than 1.5 billion euros (US$1.6 billion). (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The departure of more members from a social worker regulator would not affect its operation, according to Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, after six of them had left amid a looming reform of the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Social Workers Registration Board's website, Toby Ho and Grace Wong's terms ended on Thursday. Four others - Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan - also left earlier this month, leaving only two elected members behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that several elected members chose to resign. This was their own decision," the labour chief told reporters on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new amendment bill is very clear. Even if members resign, it will not affect the board's operation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development came as lawmakers are set to start a second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the regulator. It proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new body can also promptly disqualify social workers convicted of serious offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Legislative Council passes the amendment bill on July 3, we plan to gazette it on July 5 and the old registration board will then cease to operate," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sector, society, and the government all hope that it can be a seamless transition. To do that, we need to appoint members to the board as soon as the bill is gazetted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also defended the administration's decision to inform board members in advance that they have to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR on July 5, describing it as a "responsible" move.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday warned of potential traffic jams at boundary checkpoints near the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, as scores of travellers are expected to head north for the July 1 long weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently SAR motorists planning to travel to Macau or Zhuhai must make reservations in advance. All northbound slots for Saturday have been snapped up, while limited places are available for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have been urged to address bottlenecks near the Zhuhai checkpoint, after travellers heading back to the SAR were stuck for hours on Tuen Mun Festival earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it has installed cameras so that people can check out the traffic condition at the Hong Kong port's vehicle clearance plaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It anticipates northbound traffic to peak on Saturday, while most will return on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department will closely monitor the traffic conditions at all ports, and strengthen the dissemination of the latest traffic information to citizens who use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to travel between the three places," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Motorists have been urged to plan their return trip ahead, and travel in off-peak hours "as far as possible".

    Mixed reactions to increase in duty-free allowance

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some mainland tourists say they hope the duty-free allowance can be increased further. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759482_1_20240628175924.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There have been mixed reactions to an increase in the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau, with some welcoming the move and others saying it doesn't go far enough.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Beijing announced that it will increase the allowance from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Tsim Sha Tsui, a mainland tourist said he hopes to see the allowance increased further because he normally spends around 100,000 yuan in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope it can be raised to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, because women’s bags usually cost around that. Also, large jewellery and cosmetics items almost always cost more than ten thousand dollars," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Central, a visitor from Shenzhen said he will spend more in the SAR after the measure takes effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the original limit of 5,000 yuan is not enough because many electronic products cost more than 5,000 yuan... This adjustment will greatly stimulate mainland consumers' purchasing power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shanghai tourist said the increase won't make a difference to him, because he's only in Hong Kong to watch a concert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't really affect me because I don't buy much in Hong Kong. And now prices in Hong Kong are probably similar to the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Retail Management Association said the measure is an important step forward and it hopes the SAR government will continue to pay attention to the needs and development of the industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new promenade was opened in Kennedy Town on Friday, with officials touting it as an excellent area for people to take photos of Victoria Harbour and the Tsing Ma Bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony, Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said the 280-metre-long promenade connecting Cadogan Street and Sai Ning Street provides more space for events, and will attract visitors to the neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this new promenade will become an excellent resting place where everyone can come to the seaside for walks and picnics with family and friends. Organisers can also hold various youth activities, exhibitions and markets here to make the atmosphere more harmonious and to make the economy more prosperous in the coming days," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Central and Western District Office will also utilise the space to hold more activities to add life and vitality to the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said the Cadogan Street Promenade will be accessible 24 hours a day and is equipped with shaded seating areas.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Chang'e-6 mission collected 1,935.3 grams of samples from the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration handed over the sample container to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) at a ceremony held in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the event, the spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission Ge Ping told reporters that "we have found that the samples brought back by Chang'e-6 were more viscous compared to previous samples, with the presence of clumps".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers will carry out the storage and processing of the samples as planned and initiate scientific research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The samples, collected from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history, hold unique scientific significance as they will further enhance the understanding of lunar evolution, accelerate the pace of peaceful exploration and utilisation of lunar resources, and serve as an important asset for all humanity, CNSA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 probe was launched on May 3. Its returner, carrying the lunar samples, landed in its designated area in Inner Mongolia on June 25, marking a complete success for the mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The returner safely arrived in Beijing later. Researchers opened it and successfully collected the lunar sample container on Wednesday, according to CNSA. (Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Flights are disrupted after a portion of the canopy at the departure area of Terminal 1 collapses.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy rainfall and winds brought down a roof at the main airport in New Delhi on Friday, killing one person and disrupting flights from a domestic terminal, while flooded streets and traffic snarls threw daily life out of gear in India's capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airport area received about 148.5mm of rain over three hours in the early morning, more than the average for all of June, according to India's weather office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city of 20 million people received 228.1mm rainfall at its main Safdarjung weather station in the 24 hours ending 8.30am local time on Friday, a 266 percent departure from normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A portion of the canopy at the departure area of Terminal 1 collapsed and flight operations were shut down until 2pm, India's aviation minister told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The entire terminal, one of three at the country's biggest and busiest airport, was evacuated and an inquiry ordered into the collapse, said the minister, Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue work had been completed and eight injured people were taken to hospital, said Atul Garg, the director of Delhi Fire Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 flights were cancelled and 40 were delayed while departures from Delhi airport were running late by an average of 50 minutes, according to data from flight tracking platform Flightradar24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arrivals and departures of flights scheduled from Terminal 1 after 2pm were diverted through the other two terminuses, Naidu said, adding that passengers will receive full refunds or have the option of booking on alternate flights and routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visuals from Indian TV channels showed a taxi crushed under a wrecked metal pillar at the entrance area of the terminal, which is mostly used by low-cost carriers IndiGo, operated by Interglobe Aviation, and SpiceJet for domestic flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 10-12 cars were damaged and vehicles were still being pulled out from under the debris, said one of the workers at the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I first missed my flight in the morning due to floods. Then my 2.10pm Indigo flight to Bangalore has been cancelled. I have to urgently reach Bangalore for an official meeting," said Asif Ali, a businessman standing outside Terminal 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many other parts of Delhi were flooded as well and cars trapped in thigh-deep water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Metro services were affected, traffic snarls were reported from several parts of the city while several residents also complained of power cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the April-May general election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of new terminal buildings at 15 airports at a cost of 98 billion rupees (US$1.17 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Delhi's Terminal 1 and the terminal at Jabalpur were part of the projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposition parties criticised Modi's government, saying projects were inaugurated in a hurry before the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption and criminal negligence is responsible for the collapse of shoddy infrastructure falling like a deck of cards, in the past 10 years of Modi Govt," Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the main opposition Congress party, said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aviation Minister Naidu defended the government, saying the roof collapse at Delhi's airport was part of an old building that was opened in 2009 and not the one Modi inaugurated in March. (Reuters)

 Competition climbing only made its debut at the last Olympics in Tokyo, and the chances of Hong Kong climbers making it to Paris this summer are slim.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, home-grown climber Shoji Chan told RTHK he's taking things in his stride, and believes he will eventually make it to the Olympics one day.

    'Beijing's commitment to Hong Kong never changes'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has reiterated the central government's commitment to maintaining the "One Country, Two Systems" governing principle for Hong Kong, while urging the city to capitalise on its unique advantages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, on Friday described the territory's prosperity and stability as "rock solid", and said the rule of law, business environment, as well as democracy and freedom in the SAR, remain unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shortly after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration 40 years ago, British-Hong Kong authorities unilaterally made changes to many of their promises. The last governor, Chris Patten, arbitrarily laid 'political landmines' for Hong Kong," Zheng told a Legislative Council luncheon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the central government's commitment has never changed, and it has offered extreme care for Hong Kong.".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told lawmakers that the city has "risen from the ashes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The central government fully supports Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is rapidly advancing from stability to prosperity. The biggest change is that Hong Kong has transformed from a humiliating colony run by outsiders to the apple of the country's eye," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong serves as the bridge for the world to understand China, enter China, and shake hands with China... [Integrating into the country] will not marginalise Hong Kong, or even 'mainlandise' the city. Instead, it will further strengthen Hong Kong's status and advantages, and have better achievements."

    Biden, Trump exchange barbs in fierce debate

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden delivered an uneven performance while his Republican rival Donald Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks at their debate on Thursday, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged personal insults ahead of the November election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two men traded barbs on abortion, immigration, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, their handling of the economy and even their golf games as they each sought to shake up what opinion polls show has been a virtually tied race for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hoarse-sounding Biden stumbled over his words on several occasions during the debate's first half-hour. But he found his footing at the halfway mark when he attacked Trump over his conviction for covering up hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, calling him a "felon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Trump brought up the recent conviction of Biden's son, Hunter, for lying about his drug use to buy a gun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later, Biden noted that almost all of Trump's former cabinet members, including former Vice President Mike Pence, have not endorsed his campaign. "They know him well, they served with him," he said. "Why are they not endorsing him?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, meanwhile, unleashed a barrage of criticisms, many of which were well-worn falsehoods he has long repeated, including claims that migrants have carried out a crime wave, that Democrats support infanticide and that he actually won the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden's delivery from the beginning of the debate drew the most attention afterward. Trump's allies immediately declared victory while prominent Democrats publicly questioned whether Biden could move forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the panic had set in,” said David Axelrod, a longtime advisor to former President Barack Obama on CNN, immediately after the debate about Biden's performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And I think you’re going to hear discussions that, I don’t know will lead to anything, but there are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Van Jones, another Democratic strategist, said on CNN: “He did not do well at all.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One top Biden donor, who did not want to be identified while criticising the president, called his performance "disqualifying" and said he expected a fresh round of calls for him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice President Kamala Harris, appearing on CNN after the debate, acknowledged what she called Biden's "slow start" but argued that voters should judge him and Trump based on their years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about his performance in the debate, Biden told reporters afterwards that “I think we did well,” but said he has a sore throat. Pressed about Democratic concerns with his showing that he should consider stepping aside, Biden said, "No, it's hard to debate a liar.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, were both under pressure to display their fitness for office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been dogged by questions about his age and sharpness, while Trump's incendiary rhetoric and sprawling legal woes remain a vulnerability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many television viewers took to social media to complain, describing the debate as a "disaster," a "train wreck," and a "waste of time," expressing concerns about America's future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple polls show that the majority of American voters are weary of another Biden-Trump matchup in the 2024 presidential election, with the proportion of voters holding negative views of both candidates reaching the highest level in 30 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second presidential debate for the 2024 U.S. election, to be hosted by ABC, is scheduled to take place on September 10. (Agencies)

    'Higher duty-free limit will boost HK retail'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Politicians and industry representatives on Friday welcomed Beijing's move to raise the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities announced that the limit will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, told reporters that the move will boost the city's retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that with this initiative, tourists from the mainland can shop more freely and it can benefit our various industries, especially the retail industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that local authorities have to do their part to make the SAR a more attractive place for tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the two sessions in Beijing in March, delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) signed a petition asking for the duty-free allowance to be increased to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the increase announced is a "good beginning", even though it's lower than the amount proposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This arrangement is exclusive. This arrangement is fair to both parties, and this arrangement can be adjusted going forward. And at the same time, it will be a boost to our retail industry and to our tourism industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation also welcomed Beijing's move, adding that the SAR government can work with malls to promote Hong Kong as a "shopping paradise".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, said it will hand out 500,000 sets of offers worth more than HK$100 million to overnight visitors to Hong Kong starting from July 11, including sightseeing, transport, dining and consumption discounts.

    Investment vehicle has its own unique functions: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city's government-owned investment vehicle aims to forge a more competitive tech-innovation ecosystem in the SAR, as he highlighted its differences with Singapore's sovereign investment arm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has been considered by some as a local version of Temasek in Singapore, Chan said the two bodies are “completely different” in an interview marking two years of the current administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s like comparing apples and oranges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two goals of the HKIC are to generate appropriate financial returns, and to help boost the innovation and technology industries and create a local ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Other than conducting its own investments, a more important [function of the firm] is that it will serve as a guide for other long-term and sovereign wealth funds and to invest in certain sectors together... to create a domino effect and attract HK$100 billion, or HK$200 billion or even HK$300 billion,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the government investment vehicle, which was set up two years ago and manages some HK$62 billion in assets, is still operating at an initial stage with only two deals signed so far, and authorities will reveal more details regarding projects with the release of its yearly report later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKIC signed deals with tech firms SmartMore and BioMap InnoHub earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the local property market, Chan said it remains stable despite a drop in prices in May, snapping a two-month increase following the removal of all cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid fluctuations in the residential property prices because they're affected by multiple factors, including interest rates as well as supply and demand. They're also affected by how people perceive the outlook of the property market and the city’s economic situation, job market, etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe the most important thing for the government is to maintain a healthy development of the property market, in other words, not to have major fluctuations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary added the government will keep ramping up land supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also expressed confidence towards the SAR economy in the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the economy was in its recovery stage in the first six months of 2024 and was still facing challenges, a series of mega events in the next six months will further boost local economic activity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced that the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People who buy goods at duty-free stores at border crossings will continue to get an extra allowance of 3,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The change will take effect on July 1 at Lo Wu, Futian, Shenzhen Bay, West Kowloon Station, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Gongbei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policy will be implemented at all border crossings from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the new arrangements would raise local spending by HK$8.8 billion to HK$17.6 billion and generate added value of about HK$2.7 billion to HK$5.4 billion to the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee welcomed the move, saying it shows the central government's support for Hong Kong's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new measure will enhance the shopping experience for mainland resident visitors in Hong Kong and allow them greater flexibility when shopping, which is beneficial for Hong Kong in attracting more visitors and boosting the development of diversified tourism," he said.

    Hong Kong condemns Taiwan over travel warning

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759404_1_20240628101154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has condemned Taiwan for issuing a travel alert for Hong Kong, saying the island had smeared the city and its national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said the issuing of an "orange" alert by the Taiwan authorities warning residents against travelling to the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau was a “political manoeuvre with fact-twisting smears and slanders exposing malicious intentions.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan had said the alert -- its second highest – was needed because the risk of travelling to Hong Kong had risen following the implementation of the National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR government spokesman countered that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty – just like it is in many common law jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Taiwan authorities turned a blind eye to the fact, made exaggerated remarks, maliciously smeared and demonised the NSL and the SNSO, completely unmasking its double standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that ordinary travellers – including those from Taiwan --  would not unwittingly violate the law, noting that national security offences target only an extremely small minority who endanger national security and the safety of Hong Kong.

 A Shanghai-based professor of politics said on Friday that he believes authorities will adopt a gradual approach to any major structural economic reforms that are implemented, amid the nation's post-pandemic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials in Beijing said on Thursday that the Communist Party of China will convene the third plenary session of its 20th central committee on July 15, focusing on issues related to further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney from the East China Normal University said there's a need to tackle insufficient demand in the domestic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, a major question that has dogged leaders is the extent to which they are ready to implement major structural reforms to the economy," Mahoney said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past week or so we've heard from the premier, for example at Davos, that those type of reforms aren't on the table presently, given the need to extend the recovery while facing some really big global uncertainties. Instead he's signalled a gradualist approach where the market plays a more decisive role."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahoney added that the government faced time constraints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, it's also clear that there are a number of reforms that are needed now and so we've got this rubric that's being promoted - it's not a new one, but it's become the catchphrase of the third plenum - 'comprehensively advancing reforms'", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a Politburo meeting on Thursday chaired by President Xi Jinping, who's also general secretary of party central committee, the plenum will last until July 18.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Los Angeles Lakers selected Bronny James to form a father-son duo with future Hall of Famer LeBron James in the most monumental second-round pick in recent NBA history Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The guard from Southern California will join a Lakers team that's hoping to convince LeBron James, 39, to finish his storied NBA career in purple and gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The younger James was picked 55th overall out of 58 picks in the two-round NBA draft. The second round was held on its own day for the first time this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time NBA Most Valuable Player LeBron James, the 39-year-old Lakers playmaker who is a four-time NBA champion, has previously said he would like to play alongside his son next season
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bronny James, 19, had private workouts with only two teams before the draft: the Lakers and the Phoenix Suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was widely believed that the Lakers were planning to pair him with his father despite Bronny James' one lacklustre season of college basketball. He suffered cardiac arrest the July before his freshman season and only entered game action in December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game in 25 college games. (Reuters/AFP)

 India hammered defending champions England by 68 runs in Guyana on Thursday to set up a T20 World Cup final showdown against South Africa.
 <br>
  <br/>
  England, who beat India by 10 wickets in the 2022 semi-finals, collapsed to 103 all out chasing 172 for victory, with spinners Kuldeep Yadav [3-19] and Axar Patel [3-23] sharing six wickets between them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, India posted 171-7 in a rain-interrupted innings after losing the toss with captain Rohit Sharma making 57 – his third fifty of the tournament – and Suryakumar Yadav 47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Africa overwhelmed Afghanistan by nine wickets in the first semi-final on Wednesday to book their place in Saturday's final in Barbados.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both India and South Africa have yet to lose a match at this tournament.

    'Unbeatable' Pogacar aiming for Tour-Giro double

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Race favourite Tadej Pogacar was on Thursday hailed as "unbeatable" even as he revealed he contracted Covid just 10 days ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Winner of the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France, the Slovenian won the Giro d'Italia last month and is hoping to become the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 – the year Pogacar was born – to win the rare combination of a Tour-Giro double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Giro-Tour double is difficult to achieve. It's a big challenge but I'm ready to take it on," the Team UAE rider said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The challenge will be made even tougher by the presence in the peloton of two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard, the Dane who pushed him into the runner-up spot in the past two editions, as well as two other leading contenders, Primoz Roglic and Remco Evenepoel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgian rider Evenepoel deemed Pogacar "unbeatable" if he remains "safe and sound" but that dose of Covid may just have sapped some of the strength from his legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I fell ill 10 days ago," Pogacar told a press conference in Florence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had Covid and there was a little question mark but I am fully recovered. It wasn't so bad. It was just a cold that passed quite quickly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visma rider Vingegaard, 27, was not reading too much into the news of Pogacar's Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It depends if it was a bad dose," said the Dane. "I don't know how much it will take out of him, but it doesn't sound perfect." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished mostly flat on Thursday as investors awaited new inflation data. The Nasdaq managed to slightly gain as economic data revealed a sustained slowdown, raising investors' hopes for rate reductions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The market is in a bit of a holding pattern here for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) because there haven't been a lot of big catalysts," said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird, about the release of the monthly PCE price index – the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge – on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data showed new orders for key US-manufactured capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, while core durable goods orders fell 0.1 percent versus forecasts for a 0.2 percent rise, boosting investor beliefs that a weaker economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekly jobless claims fell to 233,000, missing expectations of 236,000. Furthermore, a final print showed that US economic growth increased more than anticipated in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Benchmark 10- and 2-year yields, which move inversely to prices, dropped after the data showed a continued but moderated slowdown in economic activity, while the 7-year yields edged lower after a US$44 billion auction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacap stocks, such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms, firmed as US Treasury yields slipped. Amazon.com rose after hitting US$2 trillion in market value for the first time on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.11 percent to 39,164. The S&P 500 gained 0.07 percent to end at 5,482, while the Nasdaq gained 0.30 percent to 17,859.

    US Supreme Court allows emergency abortion in Idaho

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An anti-abortion protester demonstrates outside the US Supreme Court on the day when decisions are expected to be handed down. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759361_1_20240628041508.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court ruled on Thursday to permit, for now, abortions to be performed in Idaho when pregnant women are facing medical emergencies, as the justices dispensed with the contentious issue without actually deciding the case on its merits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 6-3 ruling, with three of the six conservative justices dissenting, effectively reinstated a lower court's decision that Idaho's Republican-backed near-total abortion ban must yield to a 1986 US law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when the two statutes conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A version of the ruling was inadvertently posted to the court's website on Wednesday in the second instance in the past two years of the disclosure of a major abortion decision before its formal issuance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden's administration had sued Idaho, arguing that EMTALA takes precedence over state law. EMTALA ensures that patients can receive emergency care at hospitals that receive funding under the federal Medicare programme. Idaho is among six states with abortion bans that offer no exceptions to protect the health of pregnant women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court's decision, an unsigned, one-line order, lifted a block, or stay, that the justices had placed on the lower court's ruling in January. But the Supreme Court did not resolve the underlying legal dispute, opting instead to dismiss the case as "improvidently granted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a separate opinion agreed with the court's decision to lift its stay, but said she would not have dismissed the case, calling the legal situation a "fragile detente".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation, and we have squandered it," Jackson wrote. "And for as long as we refuse to declare what the law requires, pregnant patients in Idaho, Texas and elsewhere will be paying the price."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May 2022, a draft of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling rolling back abortion rights was leaked to the news media a month before the decision was formally issued. The Supreme Court carried out an investigation but failed to identify the leaker. The ruling overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent that had recognised a constitutional right to abortion and legalised the procedure nationwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the 2022 abortion ruling, a series of states, including Idaho, enacted Republican-backed laws imposing bans on abortion. (Reuters)

    ISS crew takes shelter as Russian satellite breaks up

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A defunct Russian satellite has broken up into more than 100 pieces of debris in orbit, forcing astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter for about an hour and adding to the mass of space junk already in orbit, US space agencies said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were no immediate details on what caused the break-up of the Resurs-P1 Russian Earth observation satellite, which was declared dead in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Space Command, tracking the debris swarm, said there was no immediate threat to other satellites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event took place on Wednesday afternoon, Space Command said. It occurred in an orbit near the space station, prompting US astronauts on board to shelter in their spacecraft for roughly an hour, Nasa's Space Station office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's space agency Roscosmos, which operated the satellite, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Space Command, which has its own global network of space-tracking radars, said the satellite immediately created "over 100 pieces of trackable debris".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Large debris-generating events in orbit are rare but of increasing concern as space becomes crowded with satellite networks vital to everyday life on Earth, from broadband internet and communications to basic navigation services, as well as satellites no longer in use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia sparked strong criticism from the US and other Western countries in 2021 when it struck one of its defunct satellites in orbit with a ground-based anti-satellite (Asat) missile launched from its Plesetsk rocket site. The blast, testing a weapon system ahead of Moscow's 2022 war with Ukraine, created thousands of pieces of orbital debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the roughly 88-minute window of Resurs-P1's initial break-up, the Plesetsk site was one of many locations on Earth it passed over, but there was no immediate indication from airspace or maritime alerts that Russia had launched a missile to strike the satellite, space-tracker and Harvard astronomer Jonathan McDowell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I find it hard to believe they would use such a big satellite as an Asat target," McDowell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and other analysts speculated the break-up could have been caused by a problem with the satellite, such as leftover fuel onboard causing an explosion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain said on Thursday it will send 313 police officers to Paris to bolster security for this summer's Olympic Games as France remains on high alert following attack threats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The officers, including bomb deactivation experts and sniffer dog teams, will be deployed in response to a request from France for foreign assistance with Games security, the Spanish interior ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, which will host the games from July 26 to August 11, has raised its security alert to the highest level after the deadly attack at a Moscow concert hall in March. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the massacre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish police will stay in Paris for the Paralympics which will be held from August 28 to September 8, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French capital has been repeatedly hit by deadly attacks by Islamic extremists and security concerns are notably high for the opening ceremony of the Games, which will involve boats along the Seine River and huge crowds watching from the embankments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 45,000 police officers and gendarmes will be mobilised in the Paris region for the event. During the games themselves, 18,000 French military troops will be deployed, including 3,000 responsible for aerial surveillance – in addition to about 35,000 police and gendarmes. (AFP)

 The number of people sleeping on the streets of London has hit a record high of nearly 12,000, latest figures showed on Thursday, as the impact of the UK's cost-of-living crisis bites.

  <br/>
  Britain, the world's sixth-biggest economy, saw decades-high inflation in 2023 and a shortage of affordable rental properties over recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 11,993 people were seen rough-sleeping in the capital in the year to March – up 58 percent in a decade and the highest number recorded in a single year, according to Homeless Link, the body for groups dealing with homelessness in England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2013-14, the number of people sleeping on the streets stood at 7,581.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homeless Link chief executive Rick Henderson called the figures "appalling" and said the government that comes out of a July 4 general election should form a cross-party plan to tackle the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "genuinely affordable and secure homes" need to be delivered quickly with properly-funded services to "help people address the root causes of their destitution and move on from rough sleeping for good".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK nationals made up 45 percent of those sleeping rough, according to Homeless Link figures. Of the rest, nearly a third came from countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australasia, while about a quarter were from Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homelessness charity Crisis said the overall figures were "deeply shameful and highlight the desperate need for the next government to get a grip on this crisis".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charities and campaigners have long called for a government commitment to build 90,000 social rent homes a year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Communist Party of China on Thursday said it expelled two former defence ministers for "serious violation of party discipline and the law".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two are Wei Fenghe and his successor Li Shangfu, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Wei and Li formerly served as members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and as state councillors, and were deprived of their qualifications as delegates to the 20th CPC National Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CMC's disciplinary and supervisory agency launched an investigation against Wei on September 21, 2023, and Li on August 31 of the same year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the results of the investigations, they were both found to have seriously violated political and organisational discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported Wei had "helped others gain improper benefits in personnel arrangements and also seriously violated discipline regarding integrity, accepting money and gifts in violation of relevant rules."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "As a high-ranking official of the party and the military, Wei lost his faith and loyalty. His actions failed the trust of the Party Central Committee and the CMC, and severely contaminated the political environment of the military, bringing enormous damage to the party's cause, the development of national defence and the armed forces as well as the image of senior officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Li had "sought improper benefits in personnel arrangements for himself and others, took advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and accepted a huge amount of money and valuables in return", Xinhua reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Li betrayed the party's original aspirations and its principles. His actions failed the trust of the Party Central Committee and the CMC, and severely contaminated the political environment of the equipment sector in the military and the ethics of relevant industries," according to Xinhua.

    HA chair upset about lengthy drug prescription

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hospital Authority (HA), Henry Fan, said on Thursday that he finds it unacceptable that a public hospital doctor recently prescribed more than 400 days' worth of psychiatric medication to a patient.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eastern Hospital earlier said that it is undesirable for patients to be given medicine for a long period of time, after a private doctor wrote about the case of the psychiatric patient on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital said the patient, who had been seeing a private doctor, was admitted in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before being discharged, a doctor prescribed him the medication to make sure he would have a sufficient supply should he postpone future appointments, the hospital said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the HA's board meeting, Fan said the matter will be subject to a review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this case, as you all know, right now the clinical decisions must be made by the doctor on duty. So our review is not necessarily to hold someone accountable or something," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But rather, we want to give more guidelines to doctors, for them to know what to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan noted there is also an ongoing review looking at prescribing patients at outpatient clinics with no more than 16 weeks' worth of drugs, saying officials will consider this latest case together with that review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the government ordered a comprehensive, systemic review at the HA, following a spate of medical blunders and issues with equipment at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan said the authority has shortlisted several people with no links to the authority to form an independent committee for the review.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said retail sales will improve, although challenges remain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony for the Hong Kong Shopping Festival, Chan cited changes in consumption patterns of tourists and local residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the consumption patterns of the public and visitors have changed this year, the retail industry faces many challenges," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The good news is that the job market is still doing quite well, and there's still spending demand. As long as we change our approach, adjust our positioning, update strategies, link up with new demand and create consumption trigger points, business will certainly come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse, said the retail sector is hosting the shopping festival between July 1 and August 31 to boost sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this programme is going to help, at least bringing up the atmosphere to encourage our consumers to go to our retail shops to make purchases," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau Tse added that more than 5,000 retailers will take part in the festival, offering freebies and concessions worth HK$1.2 billion.

    Prolonged hot spell set to break records

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hot spell which has scorched Hong Kong for a week will likely continue into the weekend, potentially breaking the record for the city's longest heatwave since a warning system was introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The observatory said on Thursday that under the influence of a subtropical ridge, it will remain very hot on Friday and Saturday, with a high of 35 degrees Celsius or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means the Very Hot Weather Warning, which has been in place since last Thursday, could be extended for another two days or longer. The warning is issued when the temperature hits 33 degrees or higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current heatwave record was set in 2016, when the warning was in force for nine consecutive days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting assistant director at the observatory Cheng Yuen-chung warned the worst could be yet to come, as July is usually the SAR's hottest month of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said that people should brace for hotter summers than in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the background of global warming, we expect the temperature in the summer to rise compared to the past," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The general public should take extra precautions against heatstroke."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association, meanwhile, urged elderly people to take hot weather warnings seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Elderly people] are particularly vulnerable to hot weather. If you have symptoms ... like dizziness, nausea, extreme tiredness or a feeling of dehydration, please rest and seek help immediately," said the association's Chief Executive Officer, Maura Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also encouraged everyone to keep an eye on senior citizens, especially those who live alone.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at the University of Hong Kong on Thursday said they have created a model that has the potential to speed up the development of anti-ageing products and drugs to combat age-related diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Dr Cherie Lee, said that as Hong Kong's population ages, the need for age-related medical care will also increase, leading to an urgent need for research into anti-ageing methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past, studies of the ageing process have had to rely on either animal ageing models or cell lines, neither of which are accurate due to differences in human physiology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The research team, led by Professor of Biomedical Sciences Liu Pengtao, says it has developed a new cellular system that can be used to rapidly discover anti-ageing molecules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say this will enable researchers to understand the mechanisms of ageing in a controlled environment and to accurately observe the key features of ageing, thereby improving human health and longevity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said this can not only open the door to further research, such as the discovery of ageing molecules or clinical research, but also to the development of drugs for age-related diseases.

 The Communist Party of China will convene the third plenary session of its 20th central committee on July 15 in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The session will focus on issues related to further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a Politburo meeting on Thursday chaired by President Xi Jinping, who's also general secretary of party central committee, the plenum will last until July 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Politburo meeting decided to submit a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation to the plenum for deliberation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draft "thoroughly analysed the new situations and problems in advancing Chinese modernisation and scientifically planned the overall arrangements for further deepening reforms", according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elaborating on the goals and objectives of further reform, the meeting said China will complete building a high-standard socialist market economy by 2035.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The system and capacity for governance will be basically modernised and socialist modernisation will be basically achieved by 2035, it added. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of giant pandas are on their way from China to the United States where they will be cared for at the San Diego Zoo as part of an ongoing conservation partnership between the two countries, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, and Xin Bao, a 4-year-old female, departed from Ya'an City in Sichuan Province on Wednesday evening, embarking on a 10-year international giant panda protection cooperation in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It marks a new round of giant panda protection cooperation between the two countries, following an agreement signed in February between the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the San Diego Zoo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance were on hand in Sichuan for the farewell ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This farewell celebrates their journey and underscores a collaboration between the United States and China on vital conservation efforts," Paul Baribault, the wildlife alliance president, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our long-standing partnership with China Wildlife Conservation Association has been instrumental in advancing giant panda conservation, and we look forward to continuing our work together to ensure the survival and thriving of this iconic species.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan and Xin Bao will transit through Hong Kong and are scheduled to arrive in the US on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The giant pandas are accompanied by experienced breeders and veterinarians during the journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A top government official has urged enterprises to align their practices in sustainability disclosure with international standards, as part of efforts to boost the city's sustainable financial development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a climate action summit on Thursday, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk noted that the government issued a vision statement in March and aims to be among the first jurisdictions to align disclosures with benchmarks published by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To deepen Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance development, enterprises must align their practices in sustainability disclosure with international standards," Cheuk said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our target is to launch a roadmap on the appropriate adoption of the ISSB standards in Hong Kong within this year, so as to provide a transparent and well-defined pathway on sustainability reporting for businesses, as well as giving sufficient time for them to make preparations and develop readiness for the pragmatic implementation of the Hong Kong standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit, hosted by the World Green Organisation, focused on issues such as environmental, social and governance, carbon neutrality, and sustainable development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Yu, the group's founder and chief executive officer, stressed the importance of addressing climate change, saying people should not underestimate the role of green finance and technology in decarbonisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The impact of climate change and natural disasters is becoming increasingly visible, with damaging consequences on our environment, economies, and communities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, extreme weather incidents, and biodiversity loss are stark reminders of the urgency of this action. Now we stand at a crucial juncture where every decision we make now will shape the future of our planet for generations to come."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu said there more than 7,000 climatic disasters were reported from 2010 to 2020, a 35 percent rise compared to the previous decade. Such disasters cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and affected the lives of billions, he said.

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link to open on Sunday

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A mega transport link connecting Shenzhen and Zhongshan is expected to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes. Image: CCTV" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759256_1_20240627121736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A major transport link connecting Shenzhen and Zhongshan will open on Sunday, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It's expected to cut the travel time between the two Greater Bay Area cities to 30 minutes from the current two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to CCTV, the link will open to traffic on 3pm on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-kilometre link includes two bridges, two artificial islands and a two-way eight-lane sea tunnel, and took seven years to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It features the Lingdingyang Bridge, described as the world's largest offshore steel box girder suspension bridge, as well as a 6.8km sea tunnel, the world's largest and widest undersea steel shell concrete tube tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A cross-boundary bus service provider said it will increase the frequency of its service from Hong Kong to Zhongshan by about 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The general manager of Shum Kong Wing Lee Cross Border Bus, Freeman Cheung, said the company also plans to introduce an extra route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, said the agency he owns anticipates the number of tour groups visiting Zhongshan and Shunde will at least double over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new road will enable travel agencies to come up with new itineraries, including one-day trips to the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A driver surnamed Wang told RTHK that she has been travelling between Shenzhen and Zhongshan via the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macau Bridge, but plans to switch to the new road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s more convenient and closer. I can probably save half an hour per trip. The toll is also lower,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shenzhen taxi driver said he thinks the new road won't be of any use to him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he has never taken a passenger from Shenzhen to Zhongshan and this probably won't change just because the travel time is shorter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has announced the postponement of a joint co-operation conference between Hong Kong and Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The one-day meeting, which Chief Executive John Lee was expected to attend in Guangzhou, was originally scheduled to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 24th Plenary of the Hong Kong/Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference originally scheduled to take place in Guangzhou today (June 27) will be postponed to July as agreed by both the Guangdong and Hong Kong sides. The official date will be announced in due course," a government statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No reason was given for the postponement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee was planning to lead a government delegation to the mainland city and co-chair the plenary with the governor of Guangdong, Wang Weizhong, to discuss enhanced co-operation in areas such as innovation and technology, finance, healthcare, cross-boundary transport and trade.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung says the government aims to establish a regulatory framework for online ride-hailing platforms within the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Ming Pao newspaper, Lam said that next month the authorities will outline the legal responsibilities that such platforms must meet to obtain a licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam expressed confidence that the government will resolve complaints about such services from the taxi sector within its current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport minister also said the government will reduce tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of it in May next year. Currently, the fee for private cars is HK$58.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said it's hoped that lower tolls at the tunnel will divert traffic from the congested Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said the government will consider building a fourth cross-harbour tunnel when planning the construction of the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands. The islands, off Lantau, are expected to be completed by 2034.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa thrashed Afghanistan by nine wickets to reach the final of the T20 Cricket World Cup for the first time on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After skittling Afghanistan for 56 at Trinidad's Brian Lara Stadium, the Proteas cruised to their victory target, finishing on 60-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Africa's left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi [3 for 6] and pacer Marco Jansen [3-16] spearheaded the demolition of a suspect Afghanistan batting line-up for just 56 off 11.5 overs after they chose to bat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje maintained the relentless pressure with two wickets apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a surface which encouraged all bowlers but left Afghanistan with too little to defend, South Africa lost Quinton de Kock early in reply for Fazalhaq Farooqi's tournament-leading 17th wicket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Reeza Hendricks [29 not out] and captain Aiden Markram [23 not out] saw South Africa to victory at 60 for one off 8.5 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Proteas advance to Saturday's showpiece occasion in Barbados where they will face the winners of Thursday's second semi-final between title-holders England and unbeaten India in Guyana. (AFP)

    French players make history at NBA Draft

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Zaccharie Risacher, right, with NBA commissioner Adam Silver. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759242_1_20240627105949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Zaccharie Risacher was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the first overall pick in Wednesday's opening round of the NBA Draft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old forward, who stands 6-foot-9 (2.06m), was the second Frenchman in a row to be chosen number one after Victor Wembanyama was taken by the San Antonio Spurs with the top pick last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a blessing, you know," Risacher said. "So exciting. There are a lot of feelings and emotions right now. I don't know what to say but it's definitely special."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French players were chosen with three of the top six picks overall, setting an NBA record for the most international players taken in the top 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher helped spark JL Bourg to this year's EuroCup final, which was won by Paris Basketball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the second-youngest player to be named the EuroCup Rising Star and last month was named the French league's 2023-24 Best Young Player after averaging 10.1 points and 3.8 rebounds in 22 minutes a game for JL Bourg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French 19-year-old centre Alexandre Sarr was selected second overall by the Washington Wizards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sarr played last season for the Perth Wildcats of Australia's National Basketball League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two seasons with Real Madrid's youth team and two US youth seasons, he spent the 2023-24 campaign with Perth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everywhere I played it just built me for this moment," Sarr said. "It's so special."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It marks only the third time in NBA history that the top two picks in the draft have not had US college experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>

    HK can guard against cyberattacks: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The innovation and technology chief has reassured the public that Hong Kong has the capacity to handle cybersecurity threats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Dong was speaking after a string of recent ransomware attacks on government departments and public bodies, with some leading to data leaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking two years of the current administration, Sun said government bureaus and departments will be asked to conduct regular inspection to guard against hackers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for innovation, technology and industry also noted that the problem was not confined to the SAR, but a global one as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of cyberattacks has been trending upwards. Judging from the data, the attacks are mainly from outside Hong Kong," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, this is also a global trend, so we must strengthen our monitoring work in this regard. Generally speaking, Hong Kong's cybersecurity is still under control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said the administration is dedicated to building an "international data park" in the Northern Metropolis, with consultations under way on the development at Sandy Ridge near Lo Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are already two hectares of levelled land, which would be released for use. On top of this two-hectare site, we are considering providing more opportunities to the industry, for example in the surrounding hillsides and slopes we can provide about more than 10 hectares of land," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Developers have until the end of July to express their interest before authorities make the plots available through means other than tendering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also expressed confidence that the SAR will continue to contribute to the country's space endeavours, thanks to its pool of talent in aerospace, after the selection of a Hong Kong resident as a payload specialist in the national space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the minister commented on a recent Legislative Council panel meeting during which he became visibly emotional while thanking lawmakers for their support for the government's innovation and technology initiatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lawmakers always ask tough questions, but in the end, everyone gave their full support. I was moved by the Legislative Council's unconditional support, not just to me but also to the entire development of innovation and technology," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So in the end, I got a bit emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said many people had questions about innovation and technology two years ago, but through government efforts, there's now a consensus in society on the issue.

 Red Bull on Wednesday unveiled its eight-rider cycling team to debut in this week's Tour de France, marking the energy drink maker's latest expansion of its sports empire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, Red Bull bought a controlling stake in the German Bora-Hansgrohe cycling team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The arrival of Red Bull in cycling... it's really huge. I think we have so much potential in the future with this joint venture," said team manager Ralph Denk at the official launch of the team at Red Bull's Hangar-7 facility in the Austrian city of Salzburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a clear plan to become the most attractive brand in cycling," said Denk when asked about his vision for the new team, adding that this would include finding "icon riders" and focussing on the development of young talents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team will compete in dark-blue jerseys prominently featuring the drink maker's logo and ride "super aero" bikes in white.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will be led by Slovenia's veteran all-rounder Primoz Roglic, who has previously won the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espana and also claimed his second Criterium du Dauphine earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former ski jumper Roglic left Jumbo-Visma to ride for Bora, starting 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's entry as a new sponsor "is a game changer or a big change for the whole [sport of] cycling," said Roglic, whose new contract is said to be worth 6 million euros (US$6.4 million) a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star-packed Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe roster for the world's biggest cycling race also includes Australian former Giro winner Jai Hindley and Russian Aleksandr Vlasov.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour de France starts in Florence on Saturday and is expected to be a four-way struggle spearheaded by bitter rivals Tadej Pogacar from Slovenia and Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard across a route designed to take the world's greatest bike race down to the wire. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Emma Raducanu registered her first-ever victory over a top-10 player at the Eastbourne International on Wednesday, saving a match point on the way to upsetting second seed Jessica Pegula as Madison Keys cruised through.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu edged a tight second-set tie-break to level the match against her American opponent and held her nerve to win 4-6, 7-6 [8/6], 7-5 after a major wobble in the decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raducanu, who missed the entire grass-court season last year following surgery, opted not to play in qualifying for the French Open or at the Paris Olympics but has a wild card for Wimbledon, which starts next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raducanu, who saved a match point in the second-set tie-break, appeared to be cantering towards victory when she led 5-2 in the third set but Pegula, who won the Berlin grass-court tournament last week, broke twice to level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former British number one, now ranked 168th in the world, carved out a break of her own to edge ahead again and survived a clutch of break points to seal the win, setting up a quarter-final tie with Daria Kasatkina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending champion and fourth seed Keys beat Ukrainian qualifier Anhelina Kalinina 7-6 [7/5], 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American will next face 2023 French Open finalist Karolina Muchova, who is playing her first tournament for nine months, after the Czech eased past Polish qualifier Magda Linette 6-4, 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Katie Boulter continued her fine form on grass by putting out fifth seed and former champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-4, 7-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British number one, who won the Nottingham tournament earlier this month, will take on third seed Jasmine Paolini in the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's event, Australia's Aleksandar Vukic put out third seed Alexander Bublik 6-4, 6-4 while fourth seed Sebastian Baez exited in straight sets at the hands of Miomir Kecmanovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese teenager Shang Juncheng beat Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 and will meet top seed and two-time American former champion Taylor Fritz, who produced a serving masterclass to defeat Thiago Seyboth Wild 7-6 [7/4], 6-3. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia secured a historic place in the knockout stages of Euro 2024 after a stunning 2-0 win over Portugal on Wednesday, while Turkey, Belgium, Romania and Slovakia all advanced to the last 16 as the group stage came to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Appearing at their first European Championship, Georgia had to record their first ever victory at the tournament to reach the last 16 when they played Portugal in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal had already qualified for the last 16 as Group F winners, and their coach Roberto Martinez made eight changes to his team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia went ahead inside the opening two minutes thanks to a fine finish from their star player, Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georges Mikautadze, who set up that goal, made it 2-0 from the penalty spot early in the second half to become the competition's top scorer on three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia, ranked 74th in the world, will now play much-fancied Spain in the next round on Sunday in Cologne, having progressed as one of the four best third-placed sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey finished second in the same group after a 2-1 win over the Czech Republic in Hamburg, as their opponents were eliminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cenk Tosun's goal in stoppage time sealed the victory for Turkey, who had been playing with an extra man since the 20th-minute sending-off of Antonin Barak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hakan Calhanoglu's superb strike put Turkey ahead early in the second half, before Tomas Soucek levelled for the Czechs, for whom Tomas Chory was also shown red after the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will play Austria in the last 16 in Leipzig next Tuesday, while 2016 champions Portugal go to Frankfurt for a game on Monday against Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, in a dramatic finish to Group E, war-torn Ukraine were left heartbroken as they went out despite picking up four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania's 1-1 draw with Slovakia secured the point they both needed to progress, while Ukraine's brave effort in a 0-0 draw with Belgium was not enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four sides ended the section on four points, but Ukraine paid for their 3-0 defeat to Romania in their opening game as they finished bottom on goal difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium could be made to pay for making a meal of a group they were expected to cruise as Domenico Tedesco's men will face France in the last 16 after finishing second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia advance as one of the best third-placed sides and will meet England next in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania will take on the Netherlands in the last 16. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher after a choppy session on Wednesday that saw big moves in some individual stocks after corporate earnings, with FedEx rising and General Mills tumbling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shipping giant FedEx surged 15.5 percent after reporting earnings that topped estimates following job cuts and other measures to cull expenses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But General Mills slid 4.6 percent as it reported a six percent drop in quarterly sales while price inflation hits demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up less than 0.1 percent at 39,127.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,477, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.5 percent to 17,805.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was not a heavy input day in terms of new news," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, who pointed to Friday's PCE pricing data as the week's most anticipated report owing to its implications for the Federal Reserve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Rivian Automotive soared more than 12 percent after announcing that Volkswagen would invest up to US$5 billion in the electric vehicle maker, establishing a joint venture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whirlpool jumped 17.1 percent following a Reuters report that German engineering company Robert Bosch is weighing a takeover bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderna fell 11 percent following clinical testing showing that the efficacy of the company's RSV vaccine fell sharply after the first year. (AFP)

    US says Assange, now free, had put people in 'danger'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Julian Assange gives a huge thumbs up after arriving at Canberra Airport. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759193_1_20240627022726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US State Department on Wednesday renewed its allegation that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange put people at risk for revealing secrets, after he was freed in a plea deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department – that included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world – whose positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also chilled the ability of American personnel to build relationships and have frank conversations," Miller said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian agreed to plea guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information and was sentenced to the time he had served in London – five years and two months – and given his liberty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange has become a hero for activists who point to his role in divulging information about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but critics fault him for putting out vast quantities of government documents without any filtering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miller said that the State Department at the time "had to scramble to get people out of danger, to move them out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pressed on whether anyone was harmed in the end, Miller said, "If you drive drunk down the street and get pulled over for drunk driving, the fact that you didn't crash into another car and kill someone doesn't get you out of the reckless actions and the endangerment that you put your fellow citizens in."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The yen, weakened by the Japanese government's easy monetary policy, hit a 38-year low against the US dollar on Wednesday, sparking speculation about a new intervention by authorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stocks were mostly lower despite a tech rebound that helped the Nasdaq edge into positive territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen slid as far as 160.75 to the greenback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite sliding through the 160 level, there was no indication that authorities had intervened to support the yen, said market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This being the case, it's possible that traders work to push the yen lower in a renewed attempt to test the resolve of the Japanese authorities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's top currency official has said authorities were ready to act 24 hours a day if the unit fell too far, but some investors suspect that the new trigger may be 165 yen to the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billions were pumped in to support the yen after it hit a 34-year low of 160.17 in late April, but with limited effect. (AFP)

    Nato names Dutch PM Rutte as next boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mark Rutte finally clinched the job last week when his sole challenger, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, dropped out. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759184_1_20240626233925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato's 32 nations on Wednesday appointed outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the alliance's next chief, handing him the job at a crucial moment with Russia on the march in Ukraine and US elections looming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rutte will take over from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on October 1 after major powers – spearheaded by the United States – agreed on his nomination ahead of a summit of Nato leaders in Washington next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader and a consensus-builder," Stoltenberg said on social media after Nato ambassadors approved the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know I am leaving Nato in good hands," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte said it was a "tremendous honour" to take over from Stoltenberg once his decade at the helm of Nato ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The alliance is and will remain the cornerstone of our collective security. Leading this organisation is a responsibility I do not take lightly," he posted online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seasoned Dutch leader, whose 14-year tenure leading the Netherlands is set to end within weeks, is seen as a safe pair of hands capable of stewarding Nato through perilous times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment was welcomed by leaders across the 75-year-old alliance, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who called it "a good choice for freedom and security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden believed Rutte "will make an excellent secretary general."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the 57-year-old faces the possibility of a possible return by former US president Donald Trump to the White House, who has long criticised the alliance, Rutte will also have to grapple with the threat posed by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After staking a claim for the Nato post following the collapse of his Dutch coalition government last year, Rutte had to use all his diplomatic skills to win over reluctant allies Turkey and Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finally clinched the race last week when his sole challenger, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, dropped out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A staunch supporter of Ukraine, the straight-talking Dutchman has spearheaded a push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets to help beat back Russia's assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Nato chief he will play a key role in marshalling allies to keep backing the war-torn country – while treading a fine line over Kyiv's push to join the alliance. (AFP)

    Kenya's Ruto says finance bill to be withdrawn

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tuesday's protests led to the deaths of more than 20 people. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759183_1_20240626233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenyan President William Ruto said on Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would "be withdrawn," dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people died and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposed to the legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But he warned that the withdrawal of the finance bill would mean a significant shortfall in funding for development programmes designed to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others, as the East African nation struggles to lower its foreign debt burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn," Ruto told a press briefing, adding: "The people have spoken."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's administration has been taken by surprise by the intensity of opposition to its tax hikes, with protests breaking out across the country last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largely peaceful rallies turned violent on Tuesday when lawmakers passed the legislation and police fired live rounds into crowds that ransacked the partly ablaze parliament complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it had recorded 22 deaths and 300 injured victims, adding that they would launch an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frustration over the rising cost of living spiralled last week as lawmakers began debating the bill containing the tax hikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's cash-strapped government said the increases were needed to service the country's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings (US$78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of Kenya's GDP. (AFP)

 The police said they have arrested a man suspected of trying to kill his wife and three daughters by burning charcoal at a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspect was detained at a guesthouse in Mong Kok on Wednesday evening and is accused of attempted murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours earlier, officers received a report from the man's wife saying that she and the three girls, aged between 13 and 16, were feeling dizzy due to smoke in a flat in Shan King Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were taken to hospital and are said to be in satisfactory condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they suspect the woman's husband left the flat after setting the charcoal alight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press briefing, Sum Ho-min, chief crime inspector of Tuen Mun division, said officers believe the suspect was having financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the Social Welfare Department will follow up on the case.
