    Sabalenka, Sinner victorious at Cincinnati Open final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This is Sabalenka's first trophy since winning the Australian Open in January. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766839_1_20240820083919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka thrust herself into US Open title contention on Monday with a 6-3, 7-5 defeat of Jessica Pegula to win the 15th title of her career at the Cincinnati Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The third seed – who missed Wimbledon with a shoulder injury – won a trophy for the first time since collecting her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played in the final and that I was able to get this title. It's really important going into the US Open," Sabalenka said. "I'm sure Jess and I will have more battles in the future – let's keep it up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the men's draw, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe in straight sets to secure his maiden Cincinnati Open championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner claimed his fifth victory of the season in emphatic style, swatting aside Tiafoe 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in 1hr 36min to underscore his credentials for next Monday's US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian top seed bided his time in the first set before breaking the match open in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiafoe, whose game faded after losing the first-set tiebreaker, still made an impression. The American, who moves into the ranking top-20, saved three match points before Sinner claimed his 15th career title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cincinnati is the fifth trophy of 2024 for the 23-year-old Italian, who began the season with an Australian Open title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy, this was a very difficult week," Sinner said. "It was tough mentally but I tried to do my best. I'm just glad I kept my level in the important moments. I handled the situations on court well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Sinner's third in an ATP Masters event after previous victories in Toronto and Miami. (AFP)

 Dan Lawrence will open the batting for England in the first Test of a three-match series against Sri Lanka, while Matthew Potts has been drafted in to compensate for the loss of captain Ben Stokes to injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawrence has only operated as an opener a handful of times in his first-class career but returns to the England side for the first time in two-and-a-half years after Zak Crawley's fractured finger opened up a vacancy at the top of the order.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thierry Henry has decided to step down from his role as coach of the France under-21 football team, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former France international Henry made the decision after guiding the under-23 side to a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The all-time leading goalscorer for Premier League giants Arsenal took over as coach of the French youth side last summer and was under contract until June 2025 but decided to step away for "personal reasons", according to the FFF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry oversaw Les Bleuets' first run to the final of an Olympics men's tournament since winning gold in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His young side eventually went down 5-3 after extra time against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss ended a promising run that had started inauspiciously after Henry was obliged to make several changes to his squad pre-tournament, due to the refusal of certain clubs to release their players for the Games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Monday, extending last week's positive trend as markets await earnings from US retailers and central bank commentary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's results from big-box chains Target, Lowe's and TJX will offer additional clues about the state of the US economy following reassuring retail sales data last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today seems to be an extension of the positive trend" from last week, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, who noted a chance that low trading volumes amid the "dog days" of summer holidays could lead to outsized market moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,896.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,608, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 17,876.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks rallied last week following encouraging US economic data that offered reassurances after recession fears buffeted markets earlier in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, chip company AMD piled on 4.5 percent after announcing a US$4.9 billion deal to acquire ZT Systems, which provides server solutions for cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  General Motors gained 1.0 percent after confirming plans to trim its software and services workforce. The auto giant will cut more than 1,000 jobs, according to US media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's calendar includes the Democratic Party's convention in Chicago, with Vice President Kamala Harris slated to deliver a headline speech on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to deliver remarks at an annual central bank gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. (AFP)

 Former US Representative George Santos pleaded guilty on Monday to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the federal fraud case that led to his expulsion from Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New York Republican entered the plea in a courtroom in Long Island just weeks before his trial was set to begin in early September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was indicted on felony charges that he stole from political donors, used campaign contributions to pay for personal expenses, lied to Congress about his wealth and collected unemployment benefits while actually working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was expelled from the US House after an ethics investigation found “overwhelming evidence” that he had broken the law and exploited his public position for his own profit. (AP)

    Trump posts images implying Taylor Swift supports him

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's Truth Social platform shared AI-generated images appearing to show he has Taylor Swift's support. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766817_1_20240820024552.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has shared doctored images on social media showing Taylor Swift and her fans support his presidential campaign, in an apparent effort to tap into the pop singer's mega star power in the US election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swift has not yet publicly thrown her weight behind any presidential candidate in the November 5 election, but she backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and has previously been critical of Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Trump shared screenshots of posts with manipulated images – including some that an expert said appeared to be AI-generated – suggesting that the pop star and her fans, popularly known as Swifties, support his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Truth Social post, which includes a poster of Swift clad in an Uncle Sam outfit and instructing her fans to vote for Trump, the former president wrote: "I accept!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That poster is either "AI generated or just classically manipulated," said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The post also includes photos of women wearing shirts with the slogan "Swifties for Trump," some of which Farid said had the "tell-tale signs of being AI generated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What makes the mash-up "particularly devious" is that is a combination of real and fake imagery, with at least one photo of a woman wearing such a shirt looking legitimate, Farid said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Swift about the post by Trump, who separately shared on Truth Social a video of a supporter voicing the dubious claim that "Swifties were rallying for Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's soaring popularity and sway over her fans could make her support valuable in the upcoming presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats have long wanted to count on her support, but the megastar has been largely reticent about her political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration of her star power, when Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote last fall, directing them to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, her plea had an immediate impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following her message, the institution said it recorded more than 35,000 new registrations, 23 percent more than last year and the most since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's feelers into politics have been heavily scrutinised, making her a ripe target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her reserve led many critics to speculate Swift was a closet Republican, until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right US Senator Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since spoken out in particular for the legal right to an abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, intense speculation has swirled on social media that Swift will endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The megastar has not commented publicly, but that has not stopped legions of fans to form a group called "Swifties for Kamala," attracting tens of thousands of followers on platforms such as Instagram and X, formerly Twitter. (AFP)

    City of Pokrovsk evacuated as Kremlin rules out talks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday ruled out entering peace talks with Ukraine over Kyiv's surprise offensive into Russian territory, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said was meeting its goals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine sent troops over the border on August 6 and has since held onto a part of the western Kursk region, in the biggest attack on Russian soil since Moscow attacked in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move has rattled Moscow and taken Ukraine's Western allies by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has said the offensive is aimed at stretching Russian forces, creating a "buffer zone" and bringing the conflict "closer" to an end on "fair" terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said on Monday that it had pushed the prospect of peace talks further away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the current stage, given this escapade, we will not talk."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called entering a negotiating process "completely inappropriate" and said future talks "depend on the situation on the battlefield, including in the Kursk region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow, intent on not letting the offensive affect its own advance in eastern Ukraine, claimed another village in the war-battered Donetsk region on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bracing for a further assault, Ukraine ordered the evacuation of families from the key city of Pokrovsk as Moscow's forces inched closer to the logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, meanwhile, said his troops in Kursk – who have set up administrative offices and published previously unthinkable footage of Ukrainian soldiers patrolling Russian streets – are meeting their targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are achieving our goals. This morning we have another replenishment of the (prisoner of war) exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to more Russian troops being taken prisoner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Zelensky said the push into Russian territory was designed to create a "buffer zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prospect of peace talks appeared distant even before Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin had demanded Ukraine cede swathes of territory if it wanted a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, who has ruled out direct talks with the Kremlin, demands Russia's full withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and reparations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, Ukraine has destroyed two key bridges over the Seym river inside Russia, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes to the combat zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bridge over the river was hit over the weekend, a Russian military investigator said in a video published by high-profile pro-Kremlin TV commentator Vladimir Solovyev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on the bridges have left Russia with limited options, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's defence ministry said on Monday Russia had thwarted Ukrainian attacks on three more villages in the Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has also been accused of sending inexperienced conscripts to protect the Kursk region, unwilling to redeploy experienced fighters from the frontlines in eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incursion has visibly worried Russians, prompting some in Kyiv to hope that sentiment could turn the country against the Kremlin's more than two-year war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accustomed to seeing the war as a television show, Russians are now seeing it up close and personal," Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you don't want to see the war, you have to end the war by forcing your 'leadership' to make peace on fair terms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, Moscow said it captured the town of Artemovo, which is called Zalizne in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zalizne had a population of around 5,000 at the start of 2022 – making it one of the largest places captured by Russian troops in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine also said Russian attacks killed four people in frontline towns on Monday, with a 71-year-old woman killed in her garden in Toretsk and three civilians in their 60s and 70s killed in the village of Zarichne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the front moved further west towards the city of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian officials announced the compulsory evacuation of families with children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are starting the forced evacuation of families with children from the Pokrovsk community," Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said, ordering the "compulsory" evacuation of children and their parents from Pokrovsk and about a dozen surrounding villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said more than 53,000 people live in the area, including almost 4,000 children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Filashkin called the decision to evacuate "necessary and inevitable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has long tried to capture Pokrovsk, which lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops. (AFP)

 Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan announced his retirement from international football on Monday after leading his country at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "After a few weeks of reflection, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to end my national team career," Gundogan said in a German FA statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look back with great pride on 82 international matches for my home country – a number that I could never have dreamed of when I made my debut for the senior national team in 2011."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan, who turns 34 in October, was in the Germany team that reached the Euro 2024 quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My highlight was clearly the huge honour of being able to lead the team as captain at our home European Championship last summer," said the Barcelona midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan made his debut for Germany against Belgium in October 2011 but missed their 2014 World Cup triumph with a back injury. He was also ruled out of Euro 2016 due to a dislocated kneecap. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Donahue, a pioneering US talk show host, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Donahue's death in Manhattan on Sunday following a long illness was announced on NBC's Today Show, where he made frequent appearances from 1979 to 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Phil Donahue Show," launched in 1967, was the first on daytime US television to feature audience participation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It remained popular through the 1970s and into the 1980s, earning Donahue numerous Emmy Awards, and the format was adopted by future talk show hosts such as Oprah Winfrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Donahue show was also notable for bringing conversations about controversial issues such as abortion, religion and sex to daytime television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Joe Biden in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He pioneered the live daytime talk show, holding a mirror up to America," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He interviewed everyone from our greatest stars to our forgotten neighbours, uniting us around the toughest issues of our time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue was married for 44 years to actress Marlo Thomas, the star of the 1960s sitcom "That Girl." (AFP)

    Blinken meets Israeli leaders at 'decisive moment'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken on Monday urged Israel and Hamas not to derail negotiations that he said may be a "last opportunity" to secure a Gaza truce and hostage release deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since Hamas's October 7 attack triggered the war, said he was back in Israel "to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a decisive moment – probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US secretary of state later met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and is due to travel on Tuesday to Egypt where ceasefire talks are expected to resume this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for delays in reaching a truce accord that diplomats say could help avert a wider conflagration in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places, and to greater intensity," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Months of on-off negotiations with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have failed to produce an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of talks in Qatar last week, Hamas called on mediators to implement a framework outlined in late May by US President Joe Biden, rather than hold more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire was "still possible" and that the United States was "not giving up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday, hours after Blinken had landed in the city, there was a bombing in Tel Aviv that was later claimed by the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One person – the bomber according to Israeli media – was killed and another wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The groups threatened to carry out more such attacks in Israel "as long as the occupation's massacres, the displacement of civilians and the policy of assassinations continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the bombing could have been more serious but the assailant detonated the explosives before managing to reach a more heavily populated area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as Israel and Hamas traded blame for delays in reaching a truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Qatar meeting last week, the United States submitted what mediators called a "bridging proposal," which Hamas on Sunday said "responds to Netanyahu's conditions" and includes terms that the Palestinian group would not accept.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas insisted on "a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip," saying Netanyahu wanted to keep Israeli forces at several strategic locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators," the Palestinian movement said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order for an agreement to be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Netanyahu said that Hamas "remains obstinate" and must be pressured, a day after his office said Israeli negotiators had expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators also reported progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to the prime minister's governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 40,139 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan announced by Biden at the end of May would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks while Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence raged on in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, an Israeli soldier and two Hezbollah fighters were killed in cross-border clashes, the Israeli military and the Lebanese militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In southern Gaza, a medical source said three people were killed in Abassan village and witnesses reported Israeli air strikes near the Islamic University in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops were operating in southern and central Gaza, and that the air force "struck over 45 terrorist targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It later said that it had "expanded" operations in Khan Younis and the outskirts of Deir el-Balah. A medical source said a baby girl was killed and several women wounded in air strikes west of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighting has devastated Gaza. A video posted to social media by a UN official showed a convoy passing scenes of utter destruction with almost every building reduced to rubble and the few still standing badly damaged. (AFP)

 Four people from Hong Kong have been arrested in Thailand on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thai authorities seized 14kg of heroin and said the suspects tried to send the drugs to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to an inquiry from RTHK, the Immigration Department said it has confirmed the identities of those arrested through the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added that it will follow up on the case.

    Govt ensures local workers get priority: Chris Sun

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says companies should prioritise hiring local workers before turning to non-local labour. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766798_1_20240819204009.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Monday reassured local workers that the government would ensure they have priority in employment amid concerns about competition with non-local labour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun's remarks came a day after the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) called for the setting up of a mechanism that would trigger the suspension of labour importation schemes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FTU said local employees are facing challenges in finding jobs in the retail, catering and construction sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three sectors were included in labour importation schemes introduced by the government last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Sun stressed that companies should prioritise hiring local workers before turning to non-local labour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when companies fail to hire a sufficient workforce through local recruitment can they proceed to the next stage – to apply to import labour through industry quotas or general schemes. This demonstrates that the mechanism (of labour importation schemes) itself guarantees priority for local workers in employment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most importantly, if local workers show greater willingness to work, the number of imported labour will subsequently decrease."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The welfare minister also said the government is looking into setting up a database for high-risk caregivers after an elderly woman and her son, who had cared for her, were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the authorities will take privacy concerns into consideration.

 Chief Executive John Lee said the Hong Kong government will continue to fully and accurately implement the One Country, Two Systems principle and leverage the SAR's strengths to serve the country's needs as he met with the visiting head of the United Front Work Department, Shi Taifeng.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shi, who's also a Politburo member and vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is in Hong Kong on an inspection visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They exchanged views on issues of mutual interest in their meeting at Government House on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the SAR government will focus on creating strong impetus for growth, improving its governance system, resolutely implementing the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong", and strengthening Hong Kong's patriotic forces with a love for the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that the recent third plenary session of the Communist Party offered important guidance for the city's long-term development, prosperity and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Hong Kong government and all sectors of the community should earnestly learn, have a thorough understanding of and implement the spirit of the session.

 Equestrian athlete Natasha Tse left for Britain on Monday for two final weeks of training ahead of the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Growing up with cerebral palsy, which hinders movement and muscle control, Tse embraced horse-riding at a young age of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making her Paralympic debut in London at just 15, the veteran is gearing up for her fourth Games in early September, where she'll be competing in the individual para dressage event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this time, Tse is bringing two “horses”. Check out our video to find out why.

  "One body was located in the wreck but not yet recovered, at a depth of around 50 metres," a coast guard spokesman told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's fire brigade and coast guard had earlier said divers were searching for seven missing people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 56-metre-long luxury sailboat, which was British registered, sank with 22 people on board when it was hit by a violent storm at sunrise, the coast guard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said one crew member and six passengers were missing, adding they were of British, American and Canadian nationality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight of those rescued, including a one-year-old child, were transferred to local hospitals and were all in a stable condition, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard named the yacht as the "Bayesian", which was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The luxury ship has an aluminium hull, can reach a maximum speed of 15 knots and can carry 12 guests and a crew of up to 10, according to specialist online yacht sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boat left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on August 14 and was last tracked east of Palermo on Sunday evening, with a navigation status of "at anchor", according to vessel tracking app Vesselfinder. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called on the government to offer tax concessions to businesses that sponsor local athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Cheng, who is also the vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), explained the number of companies sponsoring athletes was limited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of big companies that are really interested to support all the sports events. When we're talking about the marathon, the badminton competition, they do have a title sponsor," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [number of] companies supporting the athletes [is] not a lot. So, we hope that later on in the future, the government can encourage more companies to support the athletes directly, like supporting their salary or hiring them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also urged the government to purchase broadcasting rights for the upcoming 15th National Games, the 2026 Aichi-Nagoya Asian Games in Japan as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this would make it easier for residents to follow the competitions, rally behind home-grown athletes and provide a boost to the local catering and retail sectors.

    Cult of Alain Delon lives on in Japan
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alain Delon at a press conference in Tokyo in 1977. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766771_1_20240819164704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French movie star Alain Delon, who died Sunday aged 88, said that in Japan he was like a deity. It wasn't an exaggeration, local fans told AFP on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In Japan I am a kind of a god," Delon told Figaro Magazine in 1986 on one of his many visits to Japan, when women fainted and crowds chased his limousine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People get real pleasure from touching me, caressing my hand, kissing my fingers," he told the magazine, reporting on fans showering him with gifts from red roses to statuettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's breakthrough role in Japan was "Purple Noon" (1960) as the handsome, homicidal anti-hero for the original screen version of Patricia Highsmith's thriller "The Talented Mr Ripley".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon played an "ambitious roughneck who loved money, women, and was ready for anything," said Sahoko Hata, a film critic who worked in the Japanese movie industry at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This thirst symbolised that of Japanese youth at the time," Hata told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon made the first of many visits to Japan in 1963 to promote his films, but also increasingly to appear in television variety shows and at society events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His TV appearances frequently broke audience records and up until the mid-1970s he regularly topped rankings of the Japan's most popular celebrities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My friends in their 70s and 80s are still all madly in love with him. Even at 88, he looked great," Delon fan Seta, 74, told AFP on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I used to think to myself: 'How is it possible for such an attractive person to exist in this world?'," the pensioner said in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was handsome, elegant and slightly mysterious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Kaoru Fujita, a woman in her late 50s shopping in Tokyo with her daughter, Delon's name was "synonymous with 'the handsome man'."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I have to think of someone to compare him with, I would say George Clooney or Brad Pitt," she told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't think there is anyone who is as so classically handsome as he was. As an actor he was one of a kind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon gradually transformed himself into a sort of ambassador of French chic, becoming the face of Japanese fashion brand D'Urban and appearing in adverts for Mazda cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Alain Delon" brand was launched in 1978, mainly aimed at Japan and other Asian countries, selling accessories from watches and socks to cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1980s and 1990s, a Japanese tour operator even offered organised trips to Europe that featured a banquet in Paris in the presence of Delon himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extra paid options included having the honour of presenting Delon with a bouquet or having a souvenir photo taken with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon had a "dark, sad, mysterious, ambitious side, but also a bit of a loser", Yoshi Yatabe, a former programmer of the Tokyo International Film Festival, told AFP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This dark side really appealed to Japanese viewers who tend to like losers. In kabuki theatre, for example, the audience sympathises with the weakest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "France and Europe were a very far away place for me, so I would always wonder where he came from," remembered pensioner Mikiko Tsuburaya, 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was still a child, not a grown up yet (when he was popular). I would look at him as someone living in another world," the pensioner said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Monday said Premier Li Qiang would visit Russia and Belarus this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, China-Russia relations have eliminated external interference and maintained healthy and stable development," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Li's visit from Tuesday to Friday would include the 29th regular meeting between the Chinese and Russian heads of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mao said Li planned to "exchange in-depth views on practical cooperation in bilateral relations and issues of common concern" in talks with Russian counterpart Mikhail Mishustin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li's visit comes as China and Russia ramp up economic cooperation and diplomatic contacts.
  <br/>

  Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko visited China twice last year, promising in December to be a "reliable partner" to Beijing. (AFP)

    Japan to list Tokyo Metro in autumn

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Japanese and Tokyo governments are seeking to list Tokyo Metro as early as October, according to sources. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766761_1_20240819154408.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said Japan's national and Tokyo governments were seeking a 700 billion yen valuation for the Tokyo Metro as they prepare to list the subway operator as early as the end of October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  If the deal goes ahead, it would be Japan's biggest initial public offering (IPO) in roughly six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two governments, which own 100 percent of Tokyo Metro, plan to arrange a meeting of brokerages within a week for a briefing on the IPO and expect to receive approval for the listing from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as soon as mid-September, sources told the Reuters news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half the company to be sold, the IPO could raise 350 billion yen, which would exceed the size of Kokusai Electric's IPO last year and become the largest since SoftBank Group listed its wireless unit in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IPO follows the listing of other railway operators, including Kyushu Railway (JR Kyushu) in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro runs 195 kilometres of lines carrying 6.5 million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro's history dates back to 1920 with the establishment of the Tokyo Underground Railway Company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven years later, it opened Japan's first subway line, between the Asakusa and Ueno districts of Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company, whose business includes real estate and retail, reported net profit jumped by two-thirds to 46 billion yen in the financial year ended March 2024 as economic activity rebounded from the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central Japanese government, which owns 53.4 percent of Tokyo Metro, plans to use the funds raised to repay reconstruction bonds issued following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tokyo government holds the remaining 46.6 percent of the subway operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nomura, Mizuho and Goldman Sachs are the joint global coordinators for the listing. (Reuters)

    Some toilet paper can clog sewage pipes: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that toilet rolls which hold up well in wet conditions may not break apart quickly after use and can clog sewage pipes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council said it tested 25 types of toilet paper rolls in accordance with mainland standards, comparing absorbency, strength, softness, ease of flushing and hygiene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the overall hygiene and standard of the toilet paper tested was satisfactory, but four types didn't disintegrate so well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When consumers buy toilet rolls, they need to make a choice, whether they want a tougher, stronger product to use, or to balance the implications to their toilet drains," said Consumer Council Chief Executive Gilly Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said it also found that many types of toilet paper lacked proper package labelling, omitting essential information such as the number of sheets per roll, dimensions, weight and expiry dates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged manufacturers to improve product labelling and to ensure that all necessary information is clearly displayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong cautioned people against stockpiling toilet rolls and reminded consumers that proper storage of toilet paper in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area is crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Toilet rolls are not vacuum packaged, so if it is put in a high humidity environment… It can easily get moist and have germs or mould,” she said.

    Sports shoe firms urged to improve product quality

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sports shoe firms urged to improve product quality" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766750_1_20240819141848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People who are unhappy with the quality or performance of a new pair of sports shoes should not be afraid to follow up with the retailer, as the consumer watchdog says there is a good chance they will be compensated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Manufacturers have also been told to do more to make sure their products live up to the increasing expectations from users, amid a steady stream of complaints against functional footwear in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 101 complaints regarding sports shoes between January and July, compared to 227 for the whole of last year, and 257 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A complainant was refunded 80 percent of the HK$1,170 he forked out for a pair of sports shoes which claimed to be waterproof, but weren't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water began seeping into the sneakers after he wore them about five times, and the problem persisted with a second pair that the store offered free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the shoes were sent back from the factory following an inspection, the man noticed the inner rubber trim began to peel off. But the manufacturer refused to repair the defect, triggering the complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's chief executive, Gilly Wong, offered some practical tips to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You really have to examine the product very carefully when you buy it, and if there's anything wrong, you should bring it forward to the retailer very promptly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on our experience in dealing with these kinds of complaints, the manufacturers are very willing to accommodate and settle the dispute, because they want to uphold their brand reputation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also urged manufacturers to devote more resources to maintain production quality, and not to just focus on design.

    President Xi Jinping meets Vietnam's leader in Beijing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping walks next to Vietnam's President To Lam as they pass by the honour guard during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping hosted Vietnam's new top leader To Lam in Beijing on Monday, in Lam's first overseas trip since being named general secretary of the country's Communist Party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi welcomed Lam with a military parade outside the Great Hall of the People, before the pair held talks and signed cooperation documents inside the state building off Tiananmen Square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the two ruling communist parties in the world today, China and Vietnam should uphold the original spirit of friendship, continue the traditional friendship...and continue to deepen the strategically important Sino-Vietnamese shared community of destiny," Xi told Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congratulating Lam, Xi said if the two countries adhered to a "common endeavour of promoting the cause of world socialism, we believe that our road will be wider and wider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Xi had guided China to become a "strong and prosperous country", and lauded him for developing Beijing's "role towards peace, cooperation and development in the region and the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was formally named Vietnam's leader earlier this month, pledging to "speed up" a sweeping anti-graft campaign that has snared thousands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ascension came two weeks after the death of Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades, who presided over the so-called "blazing furnace" crackdown on corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam had already assumed the largely ceremonial role of president in May after his predecessor resigned in the face of the vast anti-graft purge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But now as the Communist Party of Vietnam's general secretary, Lam is the most powerful figure in the country's leadership structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His three-day trip to China has already taken him to Guangzhou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last December, China and Vietnam pledged to deepen bilateral ties when Xi visited the country, his first time there in six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That trip came after Vietnam and the United States upgraded diplomatic ties during US President Joe Biden's visit in September 2023.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tokyo shrine seen as a symbol of Japan's past militarism on Monday reported a second case of graffiti in three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo honours 2.5 million mostly Japanese killed in wars since the late 19th century, including convicted war criminals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials regularly pay homage at Yasukuni, as did three government ministers and scores of other lawmakers on the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such visits have angered some of Japan's Asian neighbours and former victims of its imperialism, especially China and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Yasukuni shrine official confirmed the new case of graffiti to reporters, without elaborating further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, a Chinese man allegedly conspired with two others to spray-paint the word "toilet" in red on a pillar at the shrine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jiang Zhuojun, 29, who lived north of Tokyo, was later arrested "on suspicion of vandalism and disrespect for a place of worship", Tokyo police said in July. (AFP)

 The government will hold a bus parade on Wednesday to celebrate the triumphant return of members of the Hong Kong team who took part in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Athletes, coaches and other members of the team will set off from Sha Tin in two open-top buses and arrive at Tamar Park to receive the cheers and applause of the public along the route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon their arrival at the park, the athletes will participate in a sharing session with students on their Olympic experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also attend a luncheon hosted by Chief Executive John Lee at Government House at noon, ahead of a welcome home reception.
  <br/>

    Newborn pandas doing well, still fragile: Ocean Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Monday said the two newborn pandas were doing well, but they remain fragile and it would probably take a few weeks before they started showing signs of strength.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park chairman, Paulo Pong, said veterinary experts were working behind the scenes to help Ying Ying care for the cubs that were born last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said on RTHK the park was thankful the Sichuan panda research centre had been providing the SAR with milk to feed the cubs, because Ying Ying doesn't have enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said the newborns have been eating and discharging well, and it would be another week or two before they grow black and white fur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mainly I think the key is how the babies eat. How much breast milk they can take in, and that they can feel the temperature from their mother - how they sleep and rest. All these are important aspects for newborn pandas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So now that we offer help artificially, on top of Ying Ying learning slowly how to care for the cubs, these things really complement each other. And we hope things will continue on smoothly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said it could take the newborns two months before they open their eyes, and learn how to walk some four months after birth. He said the theme park would try to give timely updates on the pandas, all while not giving too much pressure to the conservation experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the park would first discuss internally how it would expand its existing facilities to house six pandas, as Beijing's gift of two more are arriving next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's time, Pong said, since it would take around two to three years for the cubs to leave Ying Ying and live on their own.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index gained 139.5 points, or 0.8 percent, to open at 17,569.66 points on Monday after hopes for an economic soft landing powered US stocks higher last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Encouraging data relieved recession worries following a brutal sell-off earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 has rebounded more than 6 percent since August 5, when a steep drop pushed the benchmark US index to its biggest three-day slide in over two years. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

 Chinese and Philippine vessels collided on Monday during a confrontation near Xianbin Reef, also known as the Sabina Shoal, in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu said a Philippine coast guard ship ignored repeated warnings from the Chinese side and intentionally sailed towards a Chinese coast guard vessel on maritime enforcement duty, causing the scrape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Philippine side bore full responsibility for the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a regular Foreign Ministry briefing, spokeswoman Mao Ning said the Philippine vessels' actions had seriously violated China's sovereignty, adding China "will continue to take resolute and forceful measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Philippine government said that two of its coast guard ships had been damaged in collisions with Chinese vessels that it said were conducting "unlawful and aggressive manoeuvres". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé was left frustrated on his Real Madrid La Liga debut on Sunday as a resilient Real Mallorca held the Spanish and European champions to a 1-1 draw in their title defence opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French superstar was thwarted by Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif and after Rodrygo Goes sent Madrid ahead early on the hosts levelled in the second half through Vedat Muriqi's towering header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's star-studded side struggled to break down Mallorca, who came closer to winning the game in the final stages at Son Moix stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Los Blancos defender Ferland Mendy was sent off in stoppage time for a high challenge on Muriqi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went ahead, we had chances to score the second, and then in the second half we lacked balance," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We conceded counter-attacks, it was not a good game, it was quite a clear game to see that we need to defend better and have better balance on the pitch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti selected the same starting line-up which defeated Atalanta to win the Uefa Super Cup on Thursday, with Jude Bellingham in midfield behind the Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo attacking line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé scored in that victory but the former Paris Saint-Germain forward was unable to celebrate his first match in his new homeland with another goal. (AFP)

    Niewiadoma wins Tour de France Femmes by four seconds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma won her first women's Tour de France title by just four seconds on Sunday as she dug in during the race's gruelling final Alpine ascent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Canyon SRAM rider summited the daunting Alpe d'Huez mountain one minute one second behind stage winner Demi Vollering to maintain her grip on the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so crazy to be honest, the whole stage was such a crazy rollercoaster," said a visibly emotional Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've gone through such a terrible time on this climb, like I hated everything, then to arriving at the finish line and learning that I won Tour de France, which is insane. It's so mind-blowing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour was turned upside down on Thursday during the fifth stage when Vollering was caught up in a huge crash six kilometres from the finish in Amneville, losing 1min 47sec on the leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After third-placed finishes in the previous two Tours and a disappointing eighth-place finish at the 2024 Olympic Games road race, the victory tasted even sweeter for Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think last year's third place was there to reward me with this victory and same as two weeks ago I was so disappointed getting stuck behind a crash during the Olympics," said the Limanowa-native.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like during this week, all the stars aligned for my team and for myself." (AFP)

    Youngsters hit hard by customer service staff scammers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are stepping up publicity efforts against fraud after the number of deception cases in Hong Kong went up by 6.2 percent to nearly 20,000 in the first half of the year, incurring losses of HK$4.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But instead of the elderly, the force is now actively reaching out to young people after noticing a demographic shift in victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all fraud cases between January and June, 1,605 involved victims who fell prey to swindlers claiming to be customer service representatives of online platforms such as Taobao and WeChat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That number shot up to 1,111 in July alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-fifth of those victims were aged between 18 and 29, compared with only seven percent who were 70 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's because WeChat Pay and Taobao are commonly used by young persons, and they are the tech-savvy generation," said senior superintendent Tsang Nga-sze of the Commercial Crime Bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the cases, a 50-year-old clerk lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to a swindler posing as a WeChat representative last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was told by the fraudster that he had subscribed to an insurance scheme with an annual fee of HK$70,000, and the plan would be renewed automatically if he didn't complete the cancellation process within that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the scammer's instructions over the phone, he transferred a "guarantee payment" to the swindler, in a bid to verify his identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the process, the scammer sent me some links with bank logos on it, and also [showed me] their staff card, which made me believe that the fraudster was a genuine WeChat representative," the victim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He only realised he had been conned after he was ordered to set up a virtual bank account, apply for a loan and then transfer all the money to a designated account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police warned that September and October are peak months for mainland students to get scammed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, scammers will use the excuse that their visas have some issues because they are involved in some investigations," said superintendent Theodora Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As they are new to Hong Kong, and really want to study or work here... they will believe that they are the true officials from mainland China... and make relevant transfers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force emphasised that the public should ignore calls and messages involving money, or asking for personal details.

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766687_1_20240819064816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ernesto restrengthened into a hurricane on Sunday as it travelled well off the shore of eastern United States, threatening wind and rain along the US and Canadian coasts after pummelling Puerto Rico and Bermuda.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hurricane, whose centre is forecast to pass near southeastern Newfoundland, Canada late on Monday into Tuesday, was creating dangerous conditions for residents and vacationers along the North American Atlantic seaboard, the US National Hurricane Center said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beach goers should be aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards," the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ernesto brushed past Puerto Rico earlier in the week leaving more than 600,000 customers without power, then hit Bermuda directly on Saturday, causing more than 70 percent of customers to lose electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Weeks, Bermuda's minister of national security, reported on Sunday that the island "made it through Hurricane Ernesto without any injuries or major incidents," according to The Royal Gazette newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres per hour, Ernesto was a Category 1 storm on the five-level Saffir-Simpson scale as of the NHC's latest advisory at 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) on Sunday, with some increase in speed expected overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swells from Ernesto are affecting parts of the Bahamas, Bermuda, the US East Coast and Atlantic Canada, the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, with the storm located some 520 miles south of Halifax in Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warmer-than-normal Atlantic waters threaten to supercharge this year's hurricane season, scientists have warned.

    Putin arrives in Azerbaijan for state visit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Azerbaijan's capital Baku on Sunday for a two-day state visit, Russian news agencies reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russian television broadcast images of the Russian president's plane as it arrived in Baku in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit to the Caucasus country, a close partner of both Moscow and Turkey but also a major energy supplier to Western countries, comes against the backdrop of an unprecedented Ukrainian military offensive on Russian soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is due to hold talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on bilateral relations and "international and regional problems," the Kremlin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders were dining on Sunday evening at the Azerbaijani president's official residence, local official news agency Asertac said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Aliyev and Putin will sign joint documents and make statements to the press, said Russian agency Ria Novosti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin will also lay a wreath on the tomb of Heydar Aliyev, father of the current leader, who was president from 1993 to 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Kremlin said they would also discuss "the question of settling (the conflict) between Azerbaijan and Armenia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan reconquered the mountainous enclave in September 2023 from the Armenian separatists who had held it for three decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia accused Russia of inadequate support in its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Armenia has sought to deepen its ties with Western countries, especially the United States, much to the annoyance of Moscow, which considers both former Soviet republics to be in its sphere of influence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan is a major producer of natural gas, to whom many European countries turned to make up for the sharp reduction in Russian deliveries after the start of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also hosting the COP29 climate conference in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's last visit to Azerbaijan was in September 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has been under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court since March 2023 for the "deportation" of Ukrainian children to Russia, an accusation the Kremlin denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the threat of arrest has limited Putin's travels abroad, Azerbaijan is not a signatory to the Rome Statute treaty that established the ICC. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former Chelsea favourite Mateo Kovacic, (centre), beats Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez at his near post. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766678_1_20240819022912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City got their Premier League title defence off to a winning start as goals from Erling Haaland and Mateo Kovacic inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Enzo Maresca in his first match in charge of Chelsea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haaland marked his 100th appearance for the club with his 91st goal before Kovacic struck on his return to Stamford Bridge to give Pep Guardiola's men the perfect start to their attempt to win a record fifth consecutive English top-flight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were shorn of all four of their Euro 2024 finalists – Rodri, Kyle Waker, John Stones and Phil Foden – from the start as Guardiola opted to give them extra time off to recover from their summer exertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the champions were still able to lay down a marker against one of the few sides they failed to beat in the league last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca has the tough task of moulding a functioning team unit from a bloated Chelsea squad that has 43 players and over 50 on the books including those on loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consequences of those difficult decisions played out even before kick-off as Raheem Sterling's camp released a statement expressing his dismay at being left out of the matchday squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Chilwell was another to face the cull, while Conor Gallagher and Romelu Lukaku are among those not to have been handed squad numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  None of Chelsea's nine summer signings to date were included in Maresca's starting line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even more surprisingly, Enzo Fernandez was named captain despite being embroiled in a race row for a post on social media after Argentina's Copa America victory last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, by contrast, are a model of continuity and consistent excellence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland was one of City's few stars to have had a summer off from international tournaments and took just 18 minutes to make his mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku's low cross was deflected by Bernardo Silva into the Norwegian's path and he coolly dinked over Robert Sanchez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne curled inches wide and Sanchez leapt high to turn over Doku's deflected shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chelsea ended the first half in the ascendency and should have been level before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ederson spilled Cole Palmer's tame shot but was bailed out by Nicolas Jackson's straying needlessly offside before he turned in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden was forced into action earlier than Guardiola would have hoped at half-time as the lively Savinho was forced off injured on his Premier League debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of pre-season minutes for many on show was apparent in the more pedestrian pace than normal for a major Premier League clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea did most of the pressing for an equaliser but offered City chances to extend their lead in doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made a fine save to deny Haaland a second before De Bruyne again fired inches off target when unmarked at the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Chelsea goalkeeper was at fault for the goal that sealed their fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kovacic was allowed to burst through the midfield unchallenged and took aim for the top corner, which he found thanks to a weak hand from Sanchez. (AFP)

    Blinken in Israel as Netanyahu calls Hamas 'obstinate'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Antony Blinken arrives in Tel Aviv for his ninth trip to the Middle East since war broke out in October. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766674_1_20240819005215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's prime minister, under pressure at home and from abroad to reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas, on Sunday accused the militants of obstinance in Gaza truce talks as top US diplomat Antony Blinken landed in Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Making his ninth trip to the Middle East since the Gaza war began when Hamas attacked Israel in October, the US secretary of state is to meet Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders in a renewed bid to seal a deal that could help avert a wider conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken is later set to travel on Tuesday to Cairo, where ceasefire talks will resume in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday reiterated that it is Palestinian Islamist group Hamas that must be pressured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas, up to this moment, remains obstinate. It did not even send a representative to the talks in Doha. Therefore, the pressure should be directed at Hamas and (Yahya) Sinwar, not at the Israeli government," Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting, referring to the Hamas chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order that an agreement be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to his governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Blinken's visit, the foreign ministers of Britain and France were on Friday also in Israel to stress the urgency of a Gaza deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, US President Joe Biden laid out a framework which he said was proposed by Israel. The UN Security Council later endorsed the proposal, which would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks as Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters the besieged Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the truce talks in Doha last Thursday and Friday, Hamas called on mediators to implement the Biden framework rather than holding more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas also announced its opposition to what it called "new conditions" from Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, Netanyahu's office in a statement said Israeli negotiators have expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a Gaza truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have also reported progress and a US official said remaining gaps were "bridgeable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after Biden said "we are closer than we have ever been" to a deal, Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed as "an illusion" such optimistic talk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous announcements that a deal was close during the months of on-off truce negotiations proved unfounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the stakes have risen since the late July killings in quick succession of Iran-backed militant leaders, including Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, and as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, deepened with a feared polio outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli evacuation orders have "reduced the safe zone" in the south of the territory, leaving "no more space" for displaced Palestinians, said Samah Dib, 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people "are sleeping on the street" while clean water is scarce and "there's food at the markets, but it's very expensive and we have no money left," said Dib, who like almost all Gazans is among the displaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As efforts towards a long-sought truce continued, so has the violence in Gaza but also in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war. They did so again on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence rescuers in Hamas-run Gaza reported seven killed in Israeli bombardment of Deir el-Balah and four others in air strikes on the northern Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest killings helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death toll to 40,099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops continued operations in central and southern Gaza and "eliminated" militants in Rafah, on the territory's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the Israeli-designated safe zone in southern Gaza's Al-Mawasi, Lina Saleha, 44, said she could hear "constant artillery shelling" and the rumble of tanks "getting closer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's not a good sign and we're terrified and afraid," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the West Bank, Israel said late on Saturday it had killed "two senior Hamas officials" in Jenin. Hamas's armed wing confirmed the deaths of two militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lebanon, the UN said three peacekeepers were lightly injured in a blast in the country's south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and its regional allies have vowed retaliation for Haniyeh's death in Tehran – which Israel has not claimed responsibility for – and for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees," the US State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club watchdog said that since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces have detained "more than 10,000 Palestinians" in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in 1967.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in the Israeli city of Haifa on Saturday, Guri Lotto, 51, said he was protesting to "put pressure on the government" to secure a hostage release deal and end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US official travelling with Blinken said on condition of anonymity that "the feeling is... that various sticking points that existed before are bridgeable, and that work's going to continue."

    Toney-less Brentford get the better of Crystal Palace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brentford's Mark Flekken can only watch as Palace's equaliser rolls in. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766671_1_20240818233029.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brentford shrugged off the absence of Ivan Toney to get their Premier League season off to a flying start with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa got the goals for the Bees, who had left out England international Toney over speculation surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toney has less than a year left to run on his contract with the London club and is attracting interest from Saudi clubs after his role in helping England to the Euro 2024 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford boss Thomas Frank said pre-match his side had shown last season they can cope without Toney – who missed much of last term due to a betting ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guehi did captain Crystal Palace despite the interest in him shown by Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England defender had an outstanding Euros but a moment to forget for Brentford's opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbeumo raced onto Wissa's pass and cut inside Guehi before firing into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palace ended last season in sensational form under Oliver Glasner and will feel hard done by not to have earned at least a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eberechi Eze had a brilliantly executed near post free-kick harshly ruled out for a foul by Will Hughes when the score was still level at 0-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bright Palace start to the second half was rewarded when Ethan Pinnock turned Daniel Munoz's header into his own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seconds later, Odsonne Edouard slotted home Eze's pass only to be denied by a marginal offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was Brentford who grabbed the vital third goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dean Henderson could only parry Nathan Collins' shot straight into the path of Wissa, who bundled home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eze was twice denied by Mark Flekken in the closing stages but Brentford held out for an impressive three points. (AFP)

    Ukraine says struck second key bridge in Kursk region

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766668_1_20240818221459.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine said on Sunday it had struck a second key bridge in the Kursk region, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes as Kyiv's unprecedented incursion on Russian soil stretched through its second week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia meanwhile ramped up pressure in east Ukraine, claiming to capture another village just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minus one more bridge," Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram, publishing an aerial video of a blast tearing through a bridge near the Russian town of Zvannoye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precision air strikes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear when Ukraine carried out the attack. Oleshchuk did not give a date and Russian military bloggers shared photos of destruction from what appeared to be the same bridge dated on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6, in its biggest attack on Russian territory since the Kremlin launched its assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Ukraine announced it had destroyed a separate bridge in the neighbouring town of Glushkovo, both of which lie on the river Seym that winds through the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on both bridges have left Russia with limited options to cross the river in the area, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said the destruction of one of the bridges had hindered evacuation efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian defence ministry said in a briefing it was pushing back against Ukraine's forces near several villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 120,000 people have fled the region since fighting began, according to Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia said on Sunday its forces had captured Svyrydonivka, another frontline settlement some 15 kilometres away from Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for the Russian army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of active operations, units of the Centre grouping of troops have liberated the village of Sviridonovka," Moscow's defence ministry said, using the Russian name for the village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian forces have been inching towards Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned earlier this week that Russia was a little over 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian forces earlier on Sunday announced they had thwarted a Russian missile attack on the capital Kyiv where air raid sirens sounded before dawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the third ballistic missile attack on the capital in August with a clear interval of six days between each attack," the Kyiv City Military Administration posted on Telegram after the early morning barrage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No damage or casualties were reported from the attack, which the administration said likely involved "North Korean ballistic missiles of the KN-23 type."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region early on Sunday morning, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos published on social media showed thick black smoke and bursts of flames coming from the site of the blaze, which the governor said was in the town of Proletarsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the southeast of the Rostov region, air defences repelled a drone attack. As a result of falling debris on the territory of industrial storage facilities in Proletarsk, a diesel fuel fire broke out," Governor Vasily Golubev said on Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At 05:35 (0235 GMT), firefighting at the industrial facility in Proletarsk was suspended due to a second drone attack," he added in an update to the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one was injured and firefighting efforts resumed shortly after, he said in a later post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Proletarsk is some 250 kilometres from the Ukraine border and some 350 kilometres from Kyiv-held areas of fighting on the eastern Ukrainian front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, in what it has called "fair" retaliation for attacks on its energy infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of trafficking and manufacturing dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, who claimed to be jobless, was detained as part of a police raid on an industrial unit in Tsuen Wan on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing the press on Sunday, senior inspector Chan Yu-wing from the Narcotics Bureau believed the suspect received instructions remotely from a syndicate on how to manufacture drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers have also confiscated 2kg of suspected ketamine, and 6kg of raw materials, with a total street value of HK$960,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also discovered a large quantity of corrosive substances. In fact, during storage or heating, these chemicals could easily catch fire or explode," Chan warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore, these drug syndicates are completely neglecting public safety. Their actions are extremely irresponsible. If members of the public or security guards in a building smell something suspicious coming from a unit, like a pungent chemical smell, they should contact the police immediately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect will appear before the West Kowloon Magistracy on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has pledged to actively consider a proposal to set up a third medical school in Hong Kong to address the shortage of healthcare professionals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event honouring doctors on Sunday, Lo said the government will bolster the training of local doctors and retain medical personnel in public hospitals to tackle the staffing shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent years, the government has allocated over HK$30 billion to fund the construction of medical training facilities at universities," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, the SAR government will continue to support the two existing medical schools by enhancing their teaching capabilities, boosting admission quotas and sources. The government will also actively consider a proposal to establish a third medical school."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently only the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong offer medical programmes in the SAR, with the schools producing a combined 590 graduates each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Nancy Ip, told the media in February that she hoped to launch the city's third medical school by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She revealed the initial intake of 50 students would be gradually ramped up to 150 per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo also said in the meantime, the government will continue to introduce non-locally trained doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects more than 250 doctors who were trained overseas will have joined the public healthcare system by the end of this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday the city's economy is expected to improve next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a two-hour public forum in Tai Po to solicit views for the upcoming Policy Address, the SAR leader heard numerous appeals from the audience to prop up certain industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A securities worker said he had never seen so many brokerage firms shut down. While acknowledging efforts by the SAR administration to lure investment from abroad, he felt the sector has yet seen any material impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lee admitted "difficulties" and "challenges" in the current environment. He believed investors are taking a cautious approach, citing factors such as the upcoming US presidential election, the interest rate development, as well as geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, "those bet against Hong Kong in the long run will be the first to lose", Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the global economic axis is shifting to the East. We should focus on Asean countries and the Middle East, which are the new engines for global development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader was also urged to provide more support to the cultural, sports, and tourism sectors, fresh off stellar performances by Hong Kong's Olympians at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, culture, sports and tourism have been emphasised as a whole. We have had great news recently with the birth of the twin panda cubs, while two more giant pandas are on their way as a gift from the central authorities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More consultation forums will be held in the coming weeks, before Lee delivers his third annual policy blueprint in October.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government announced on Sunday that a delegation of national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics will visit Hong Kong at the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The elite athletes will arrive in the SAR by plane on August 29. Fans will have a chance to greet them at three public events - a gala show on the evening of August 30, and two concurrent demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park Swimming Pool on the morning of August 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will depart the city on the same afternoon and make their way to Macau, where they will stay another three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also meet local athletes at the Sports Institute, and attend a reception and banquet hosted by the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who exactly will be coming remains unknown, but the Leisure and Cultural Services Department confirmed there will be badminton and table tennis stars, as well gymnasts, divers and swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has expressed gratitude to the General Administration of Sport of China and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office for arranging the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong people will be able to share the national team's joy and triumphs, thereby strengthening their patriotic passion and national spirit, especially among the youngsters," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE noted past visits by the national team had "always been a craze", and hoped the athletes will share their journey of perseverance and success and promote the spirit of Chinese sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 tickets for the events will go on sale from 10am on Thursday. Each person can buy no more than two tickets, priced at HK$20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some seats have also been reserved for the underprivileged free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identity checks will be enforced at the door to weed out scalping activities, and the government urged spectators to arrive ahead of time.

    French actor Alain Delon dies aged 88

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Delon in the 1967 gangster film "Le Samourai". Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766641_1_20240818145229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French actor Alain Delon, who melted the hearts of millions of film fans whether playing a murderer, hoodlum or hitman in his postwar heyday, has died, French media reported on Sunday. He was 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delon had been in poor health since suffering a stroke in 2019, rarely leaving his estate in Douchy, in France's Val de Loire region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With striking blue eyes, Delon was sometimes referred to as the "French Frank Sinatra" for his handsome looks, a comparison Delon disliked. Unlike Sinatra, who always denied connections with the Mafia, Delon openly acknowledged his shady pals in the underworld.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a 1970 interview with the New York Times, Delon was asked about such acquaintances, one of whom was among the last "Godfathers" of the underworld in the Mediterranean port of Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most of them the gangsters I know ... were my friends before I became an actor," he said. "I don't worry about what a friend does. Each is responsible for his own act. It doesn't matter what he does."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon shot to fame in two films by Italian director Luchino Visconti, "Rocco and His Brothers" in 1960 and "The Leopard" in 1963.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He starred alongside venerable French elder Jean Gabin in Henri Verneuil's 1963 film "Melodie en Sous-Sol" ("Any Number Can Win") and was a major hit in Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 "Le Samourai" ("The Godson"). The role of a philosophical contract killer involved minimal dialogue and frequent solo scenes, and Delon shone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon became a star in France and was idolised by men and women in Japan, but never made it as big in Hollywood despite performing with American cinema giants, including Burt Lancaster when the Frenchman played apprentice-hitman Scorpio in the eponymous 1973 film.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1970 film "Borsalino", he starred with fellow French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, playing gangsters who come to blows in an unforgettable, stylised fight over a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowning moments also included 1969 erotic thriller "La Piscine" ("The Swimming Pool"), where Delon paired up with real-life lover Romy Schneider, in a sultry French Riviera saga of jealously and seduction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born just outside Paris on November 8, 1935, Delon started life on the back foot: he was put in foster care aged four after his parents divorced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran away from home at least once and was expelled several times from boarding schools before joining the Marines at 17 and serving in then French-ruled Indochina. There too he got into trouble over a stolen jeep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in France in the mid-50s, he worked as a porter at Paris wholesale food market, Les Halles, and spent time in the red-light Pigalle district before migrating to the cafes of the bohemian St. Germain des Pres area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There he met French actor Jean-Claude Brialy, who took him to the Cannes Film Festival, where he attracted the attention of an American talent scout who arranged a screen test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his film debut in 1957 in "Quand la femme s'en mele" ("Send a Woman When the Devil Fails").
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SULPHUROUS FRIENDS
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon was a businessman as well as an actor, leveraging his looks to sell branded cosmetics and dabbling in race-horses with old underworld friends. He invested in a racehorse stable with Jacky "Le Mat" Imbert, a notorious figure in a thriving Marseille crime scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's more louche friendships exploded to the surface when a former bodyguard-cum-confidant, a young Yugoslav called Stefan Markovic, was found dead in a bag, with a bullet in his head, discarded in a rubbish dump near Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor was interrogated and cleared by police but the "Markovic Affair" snowballed into a national scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man police charged with the Markovic murder - he was later acquitted - was Francois Marcantoni, a Corsican cafe owner and friend of Delon who thrived in the hustle and bustle of the Pigalle district in the aftermath of World War Two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon was outspoken off-stage and courted controversy when he did so - notably when he said he regretted the abolition of the death penalty and spoke disparagingly of gay marriage, which was legalised in France in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He publicly defended the far-right National Front and telephoned its founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, an old friend, to congratulate him when the party did well in local elections in 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's lovers included Schneider and German model-turned-singer Nico, with whom he had a son. In 1964, he married Nathalie Barthelemy and fathered a second son before ending the marriage and embarking on a 15-year relationship with Mireille Darc. He had two more children with Dutch model Rosalie van Breemen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a January 2018 interview, Delon told Paris Match he was fed up with modern life and had a chapel and tomb ready for him on the grounds of his home near Geneva, and for his Belgian shepherd dog, called Loubo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I die before him I'll ask the vet to let us go together. He will give the dog an injection so he can die in my arms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's last major public appearance was to receive an honorary Palme d'or at the Cannes film festival in May 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his last years, Delon was the centre of a family feud over his care, which made headlines in French media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April 2024 a judge placed Delon under "reinforced curatorship", meaning he no longer had full freedom to manage his assets. He was already under legal protection over concerns over his health and well-being. (Reuters)

    HK people can help in global charitable work: CY Leung

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former chief executive CY Leung said on Sunday he hopes more young people can join the country's global charitable drive, saying Hongkongers have an advantage in such work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the GX Foundation, which he set up six years ago, has been helping seven countries in three different continents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes performing surgery for some 15,000 cataract patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's now a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said when he visited those places, the conditions reminded him of China's past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I go around these places, I see situations worse than how our country was some 40-plus years ago. The medical and public health conditions were rather bad," Leung spoke on a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we utilise the strength of our Chinese community and provide help, do something. And we've got some good results. Such initiatives also help to connect Chinese and overseas peoples."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charity now plans to provide water filtering services to needy countries, on top of educating young people about the Belt and Road Initiative and public health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hongkongers have unique advantages in joining these charitable drives for China, such as the convenience of visa-free travel with an SAR passport, and the city's role as a global aviation and logistics hub.

    URA hits back at homeowners over maintenance needs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wai Chi-sing said it is wrong for homeowners to think that they should no longer pay for maintenance works after their
buildings have been earmarked for redevelopment. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766630_1_20240818124905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority on Sunday criticised homeowners who complained about their buildings being earmarked for redevelopment just after they had started maintenance work on their buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statutory body's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, said it is wrong to think that it is a waste of money to repair dilapidated structures, saying it is a matter of public safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the URA announced redevelopment plans for a tenement block in To Kwa Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The building, which is more than half a century old, was already undergoing repair works with scaffolding erected across the facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The media cited  flat owners as saying that they'd rather not continue with the rest of the works - now that their block would most likely be knocked down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Wai reminded owners it takes quite a long time for a redevelopment project to be completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's a maintenance need for buildings earmarked in renewal plans, or they have received mandatory inspection or repair orders from the government, the homeowners really should not delay the procedures and think that they can just wait for the URA's acquisition," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because in the event that during the wait, a lack of repairs leads to an accident that causes injury or even death, it is possible homeowners will have to shoulder relevant legal responsibilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said if homeowners kept relevant records and receipts for the maintenance works, they would be able to apply for ex gratia reimbursements from the URA after they accept an acquisition offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He explained that redevelopment projects must be kept confidential before their launch, because they involve acquisition and compensation.

    Thai king formally appoints Paetongtarn Shinawatra

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Thai king on Sunday formally appointed Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 37-year-old daughter of controversial billionaire ex-premier Thaksin, as Thailand's new prime minister.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn, the kingdom's youngest ever PM, comes to office after a court sacked the previous premier and disbanded the main opposition party, throwing Thailand's ever-febrile political scene into a new round of turmoil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is the third Shinawatra to be prime minister, but will hope to avoid the fate of her father and aunt Yingluck, both of whom were thrown out of power in military coups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn received King Maha Vajiralongkorn's official written command to form a government in a ceremony at the headquarters of a former pro-Thaksin TV station soon after 9:30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called on all Thais to work together to help revitalise the country's sluggish economy, which has struggled to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As head of the government I will work with parliament with an open heart, open to all ideas to help develop the country," she said after the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fellow Thais, this duty cannot be done by the prime minister alone. I hope I will be able to coordinate the power of all generations, all talented people in Thailand -- from the cabinet, the coalition, civil servants, private sector and the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, 75, was a prominent attendee at the ceremony, standing alongside Paetongtarn's husband in the front row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has to work hard. Her strong point is that she is young, she can ask anyone for help -- she is humble," Thaksin told reporters after the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Twenty-three years ago she was standing behind my back but today I was standing behind her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn heads a coalition government led by her Pheu Thai party -- the latest incarnation of the political movement founded by her father in the early 2000s -- but including some pro-military groups long opposed to Thaksin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her elevation to the top job came about after the kingdom's Constitutional Court sacked previous premier Srettha Thavisin on Wednesday for breaching ethics rules by appointing a cabinet minister with a criminal conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand has been dominated for more than 20 years by a tussle for dominance between Thaksin and his allies and the kingdom's conservative pro-military, pro-royalist elite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties linked to the former telecoms tycoon and one-time Manchester City owner have repeatedly won elections, only to find their governments upended by coups and court rulings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is a relative newcomer, running the hotel arm of the family business until late 2022 when she entered politics ahead of last year's general election where Pheu Thai was unexpectedly beaten into second place by the upstart progressive Move Forward Party (MFP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite winning most seats in last year's election, MFP was blocked from forming a government by conservative junta-appointed senators spooked by its promise to reform royal insult laws and break up powerful business monopolies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That allowed Pheu Thai to strike an uneasy coalition deal with pro-military parties once staunchly opposed to Thaksin and his followers, leading to Srettha's ascension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a year later, he became the third prime minister from a Thaksin-backed party to be kicked out by the Constitutional Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn will be watched closely for signs of influence exerted by her father, who is the most influential but controversial politician in modern Thai history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked Sunday if he would take an official role as her advisor, Thaksin said: "Not neccessary. I am old. I am 75 years old, She can ask me anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He transformed the kingdom's politics in the early 2000s with populist policies that won him and his party enduring loyalty from the rural masses -- and two election victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that success came at a cost: he was despised by Thailand's powerful elites and conservative establishment, who saw his rule as corrupt, authoritarian and socially destabilising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ousted as prime minister by the army in 2006, Thaksin went into exile two years later but never stopped commenting on national affairs -- or meddling in them, according to his critics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned last year on the day Srettha became PM, and was immediately jailed on graft and abuse of office charges dating back to his time in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his eight-year sentence was quickly cut to one year by the king, and he was then soon granted parole because of his age and poor health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday he was granted a royal pardon, making him a free man two weeks before his parole was due to end. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A search is continuing on Lantau Island for two stray dogs who were allegedly abused by workers of the Po Lin Monastery last Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police confirmed they have arrested two men, aged 65 and 46, on suspicion of animal abuse. Both have been granted bail pending an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, who worked as chefs at the Buddhist institution, allegedly removed the canines from the quarters, before setting them free at a remote location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monastery said it has arranged staff to look for the stay dogs near Sham Wat Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement online, it said, "the monastery has always been kind to stray dogs around Ngong Ping, providing them a shelter, arranging sterilisation, vaccination and basic medical treatment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprawling monastery on Ngong Ping is home to the Big Buddha, one of the main tourist attractions of Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD on Saturday announced plans to open a car production plant in Pakistan, where it will also start selling three models through a partnership with Mega Motors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BYD is the first major new electric vehicle entrant in the Pakistani market, where there is a lack of charging infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entry into the Pakistani market is not just about bringing advanced vehicles to consumers," said Liu Xueliang, BYD's general manager for Asia Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about driving a broader vision of environmental responsibility and technological innovation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD also plans to open three "flagship stores and experience centres" in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, the company said at a launch event in Lahore, adding it plans to start selling two SUV models and a sedan from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mega Motors is a unit of Pakistan's largest private utility Hub Power Co Ltd, known as Hubco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will establish Pakistan's first NEV assembly plant... dedicated to producing BYD's cutting-edge new energy vehicles," said Hubco Chief Executive Kamran Kamal, who described the deal as a "landmark investment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new plant will begin operations in 2026, Kamal told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hubco will setup fast-charging stations across major cities, motorways and highways to enhance Pakistan's charging infrastructure. (Reuters)

 The Observatory on Sunday cancelled the Amber Rainstorm Warning at 9am, after it had been in place for about three hours.

  <br/>
  It is the second day in a row that the Observatory has issued the amber warning, as Hong Kong continues to be hit by heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government called on members of the public to report any flooding and warned employers, contractors and workers to be aware of electrical safety at work.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maria Corina Machado stands on a truck in Caracas to address her supporters. Machado has called for mass gatherings in more than 300 cities in Venezuela and abroad. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766603_1_20240818022148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has mostly been in hiding since July 28 presidential polls, led a "Protest for the Truth" in Caracas on Saturday against Nicolas Maduro's disputed claim of having won reelection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atop an opposition campaign truck, and surrounded by motorcyclists and cars waving the national flag, she joined hundreds of supporters gathered in the capital in response to her call for mass gatherings in more than 300 cities in Venezuela and abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Machado had called for the anti-Maduro movement to "remain firm and united" in the face of threats and violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're trying to scare us, to divide us, to paralyze us, to demoralize us, but they can't because they are absolutely entrenched in their lies (and) violence," she wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many protesters waved printed copies of election records from their voting stations, which they say prove the opposition won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) proclaimed Maduro the winner of a third six-year term until 2031, giving him 52 percent of votes cast on July 28 but without providing a detailed breakdown of the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition says polling-station-level results show its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia took more than two-thirds of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia replaced Machado on the ballot after she was ruled out of running by institutions loyal to the regime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we keep quiet, this makes no sense," said demonstrator Adriana Calzadilla, a 55-year-old teacher in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a criminal government that wants to hold on to power. I smell freedom, I have nothing to fear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-Maduro protests have claimed 25 lives so far, with nearly 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested since election day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early on Saturday, a heavy security presence took shape in the capital, with two armoured vehicles and 40 motorcycle-mounted troops controlling access to the low-income Petare neighborhood, a few miles from the opposition's gathering point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media reported similar deployments in other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one of the first overseas demonstrations to get under way Saturday, more than 100 Venezuelans in Australia rallied in Sydney, waving national flags and balloons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a strong message to our people in Venezuela. We are with you, and we want the world to listen what we are saying," said protest organizer Rina Rivas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear if Gonzalez Urrutia, also in hiding, will attend Saturday's march. He last appeared in public at a protest on July 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro had called for Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia to be arrested. He accuses them of seeking to foment a "coup d'etat." (AFP)

    Liverpool brush aside Ipswich, Arsenal beat Wolves

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Liverpool manager Arne Slot and first team individual development coach Aaron Briggs watch the game. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766596_1_20240817223239.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot got off to a winning start as Liverpool manager with a 2-0 win at newly-promoted Ipswich on Saturday as Arsenal began their Premier League title challenge by beating Wolves by the same scoreline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newcastle defied an early red card for Fabian Schar to edge past Southampton 1-0, while Brighton ran riot under new manager Fabian Hurzeler in a 3-0 victory at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot has huge shoes to fill at Anfield after the departure of Jurgen Klopp, who restored the Reds to the top of the English game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman was left less than impressed by his side's first 45 minutes at Portman Road as Ipswich flew out of the traps on their return to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Liverpool were a different side after the break as goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah barely reflected their dominance to get Slot off to the perfect start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We as a team made a big change at half-time because we came out totally different to how we had come out in the first half," said the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second half, we won more duels, we won more second balls and we played more balls in behind because if the other team takes the risk of playing one-v-one and you have the likes of Luis Diaz, Mo Salah and Diogo Jota then use them, play the balls in behind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have finished second to Manchester City in each of the past two seasons and are highly-fancied to be the champions' closest challengers again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kai Havertz opened the scoring at the Emirates from Bukayo Saka's cross to reward the Gunners' early dominance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men needed a vital save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen and Matheus Cunha missed a huge chance to level before Arsenal made the points safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The roles from the first goal were reversed as this time Havertz teed up Saka to lash home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's hopes of a winning start to the season looked to have been undone when Schar was sent off after just 28 minutes for what the referee deemed a headbutt on Ben Brereton Diaz despite limited contact between the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton had dominated even the early exchanges against the Magpies' full compliment but failed to convert from 19 shots and nearly 80 percent possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Newcastle were clinical as Alexander Isak teed up Joelinton for the only goal just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's final season at Goodison Park got off to a nightmare start as 31-year-old Hurzeler enjoyed a dream start to life in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaoru Mitoma fired Brighton in front on his return from injury that saw the Japanese international miss much of last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Welbeck added a second after the break before Everton were reduced to 10 men when Ashley Young saw red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Adingra made it 3-0 late on and only a VAR review denied Brighton a fourth through Yasin Ayari.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Semenyo stepped into the void left at Bournemouth by the departure of Dominic Solanke with a late equaliser to salvage a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City begin their defence of the title in the standout fixture of the weekend at Chelsea on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester United got their campaign off to a winning start on Friday when debutant Joshua Zirkzee came off the bench to grab a late winner in a 1-0 victory over Fulham. (AFP)

    Hongkongers told to not panic about mpox outbreak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Infectious diseases expert Professor Ivan Hung says the chances of the mpox virus spreading to Hong Kong is very low. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766586_1_20240817180654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Saturday were told not to panic about the more deadly and transmissible clade 1b strain of the mpox virus, but those belonging to the high-risk groups should stay vigilant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advice from infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung came after the World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency - the highest level of alarm that can be issued by the world body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox were reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in a single week, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit country, the Democratic Republic of Congo has reported 222 confirmed and 783 suspected cases, as well as 24 deaths in one week, the African Union health agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Hung told RTHK that the chance of the virus spreading to the SAR was very low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he urged those belonging to high-risk groups - such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, bisexuals, and laboratory workers - to get vaccinated and watch out for symptoms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include a rash, a fever, coughing, and a stuffy nose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But important, of course, is that you have to take extra precaution if you belong to the high-risk groups and also those who are immunocompromised, then of course you should be cautious and consider taking the vaccines,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong professor also urged people to avoid travelling to high-risk areas in Africa, and not to touch wild animals so as to reduce the risk of catching the viral disease. (with additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand thumped Argentina 42-10 on Saturday as Will Jordan grabbed two of their six tries in The Rugby Championship to avenge last week's shock defeat by the Pumas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Damian McKenzie scored 17 points in Auckland as the All Blacks defied wet conditions in a skilled attacking display to maintain their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was vast improvement on the 38-30 loss in Wellington last week, with an explosive first-half performance pushing the hosts 35-3 ahead through five converted tries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was built on a dominant display from the forwards, who heeded the call for "redemption" issued to them by coach Scott Robertson after they were outplayed a week earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina's scrum was overpowered and they weren't the same force at the breakdown in a performance punctuated by mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their lone try came late in the match to fullback Juan Cruz Mallia, meaning the second half was drawn 7-7, helped by tighter defence from the visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was New Zealand's best performance under first-year coach Robertson in his fifth match in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory continued New Zealand's remarkable record in Auckland, where they've won 50 Tests since their last defeat, against France in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed all his six conversion attempts and his general play was superior to the first Test, mixing an astute long kicking game with some clever chips to counter the Pumas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The playmaker also opened the scoring with a try after pouncing on a chip from Jordie Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santiago Carreras responded with a Pumas penalty goal before New Zealand captain Ardie Savea powered over for his 27th Test try -- lifting him level with former skipper Richie McCaw for the most by an All Blacks forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Caleb Clarke and Jordan were both put into space for tries -- the latter capitalising on a blindside break from scrum-half TJ Perenara.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie's sweetly timed pass put Beauden Barrett across just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan continued the rout soon after the break, lifting him to 33 tries in as many Tests in his first starting appearance since last year's World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game entered a lull before Mallia's try and a late yellow card was shown to All Blacks hooker Asafo Aumua for a high tackle. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tobacco and Control Office on Saturday said it launched a crackdown on the smoking of waterpipes, also known as shishas or hookahs, in Tsim Sha Tui on Friday night, issuing 11 fixed penalty notices at one bar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers including those in plain clothes raided the bar, handing out the notices which carry a penalty of HK$1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also said the bar's operators may be prosecuted under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance, and for aiding and abetting smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tobacco and Control Office spokesman said due to deeper inhalation a waterpipe smoker usually inhales more toxins and that a typical one-hour session exposes the user to 100-to-200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also flagged the carbon monoxide poisoning risk of charcoal burning and the unhygienic smoking apparatus

<div class="itemFullText">
 A typhoon that blasted parts of Japan with more than 200-kilometre-per-hour winds moved out to sea on Saturday, mostly sparing the capital and allowing trains and some flights to resume.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tokyo and its surrounding areas had been on high alert on Friday for Ampil's approach, with transport services, trips, events and school classes cancelled en masse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm was packing gusts of 216 kilometres per hour on Saturday morning when it veered away from the archipelago and headed northeast into the Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, the Japan Meteorological Agency warned that "some areas in the northern part of Japan are experiencing heavy rain due to warm, humid air around the typhoon".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please be advised that the risk of landslides has been significantly elevated by the heavy rain so far in some areas", the weather agency said in an advisory on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although a severe hit on Tokyo never came, some minor injuries and damage were reported, including broken windows, toppled trees and broken utility poles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most parts of Japan's bullet train network went back to normal on Saturday after the Central Japan Railway Company closed a busy section between Tokyo and Nagoya the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "JR Central bullet trains are business as usual today," the railway firm said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airlines were still being affected to a degree, with broadcaster NHK saying All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines had together scrapped 68 flights as of Saturday morning, after hundreds of cancellations the day before. (AFP)

    Sports Institute head defends athlete sponsorship

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) chief executive Tony Choi says the institute provides the city's athletes with an overall package, which includes some financial sponsorship, but athletes are not its employees.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments come after Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary general of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, said local athletes didn't have a need to spend much as they were allocated with accommodation, training, and medical support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But online criticism continued following the SAR's success at the Paris Olympics, with athletes chiming in and saying they had to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Choi said entry-level full-time athletes get around HK$7,000 a month, so they could focus on training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSI and the athlete are not employer and employee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But also we are including overseas training, local training, coaching support, accommodation, meals, and also education support. It's an overall package for the elite athletes... They are not our staff."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi denied that the limited subsidy provided had led to potential athletes dropping out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see many athletes dropping out... We tried our best to help, in terms of other expenses, which included study, career planning. We hope to give athletes motivation... If many potential athletes dropped out, Hong Kong wouldn't have achieved good results," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi added that "only the fittest will survive", and resources given to athletes were inevitably hinged on their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-chairman of the HKSI, Vincent Cheng, said a review on a direct subsidy scheme for local athletes will be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have to review every four years. We're going to have this review starting from September and October, and hopefully we can finish it earlier next year. We will review... especially on their subsidy support," he said.
