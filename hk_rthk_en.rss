 One person was killed and three others were injured in an explosion in a residential building in Harbin, capital of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local authorities suspect an exploding gas tank caused the blast which occurred at around 7am on Thursday morning in Xiangfang District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dashcam footage from a nearby vehicle driving along a highway showed a plume of smoke suddenly appearing, and debris strewn across the road, slowing down surrounding traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injuries to the three people are not life-threatening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further investigation into the cause of the explosion is underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's president made a long-haul trip to the restive Pacific territory of New Caledonia on Thursday, urging a "return to peace" after deadly rioting, and vowing thousands of military reinforcements will be deployed for "as long as necessary".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Emmanuel Macron arrived in the capital Noumea after a 24-hour flight seeking ways to end more than a week of looting, arson and clashes that have left six people dead and hundreds injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he exited the plane at Tontouta International Airport, the French leader told reporters he wanted to ensure that "as quickly as possible there will be a return to peace, calm, security".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is the absolute priority," Macron added, as he prepared to launch a day of intensive meetings with local leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later, he described the unrest as an "absolutely unprecedented insurrection movement".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one saw it coming with such a level of organisation and violence," he said while visiting a police station in the capital Noumea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Praising security forces for "professionalism" and "cool-headedness", he vowed Paris would "go until the end" to quell the worst violence to erupt in the territory in four decades, warning that "the coming days and weeks will still be difficult".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to spend about 12 hours on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France has ruled New Caledonia since the 1800s, but many Indigenous Kanaks still resent Paris' power over their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since May 13, separatists have cut off whole neighbourhoods and the main route to the international airport, which remains shuttered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nightly riots have seen scores of cars, schools, shops and businesses burned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities have imposed a state of emergency, placed separatist leaders under house arrest, banned alcohol sales and sent around 3,000 troops, police and other security reinforcements to quell the turmoil. (AFP)

    Study shows Chinese calligraphy promotes brain health

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The researchers say Chinese calligraphy can stimulate brain function. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754363_1_20240523132205.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese University study on Thursday showed that practising Chinese calligraphy can promote brain health, with researchers recommending that people be encouraged to take part in more cognitive activity to prevent dementia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The study involved more than 100 people aged between 55 and 75 who had been practising Chinese calligraphy for an hour a week for a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of the participants doubled their practice time during the study, and the researchers found significant improvements in their brain network connectivity and memory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psychiatrist Allen Lee, who led the research, explained why Chinese calligraphy can stimulate brain function.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you practise, you use your memory because you have to remember the words. You have to pay attention to what you are writing, and you have to have good eye and hand coordination," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You check your work. If you have the chance to practise again, how would you improve it? So you have that kind of reflection."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also suggested that other cognitive activities, such as reading and playing chess or mahjong, have similar benefits, making them a valuable lifestyle intervention to prevent dementia in Hong Kong's ageing population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The risk of developing dementia increases with age. So it's really important that not only older adults, but even those who are now in middle age, start to be aware of the importance of cognitive activities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want people to be aware of brain health and find ways to help themselves to prevent or slow down the risk of developing dementia."

    Nvidia profits soar driven by demand for AI chips

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The AI boom has been a huge boost to Nvidia which saw profits and revenues rise considerably. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754360_1_20240523130214.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Nvidia easily beat Wall Street estimates as its profits and revenues skyrocketed, boosted by its chipmaking dominance which has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to US$14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from US$2.04 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue more than tripled, rising to US$26.04 billion from US$7.19 billion in the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The next industrial revolution has begun,” CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centre he called “AI factories” designed to produce “a new commodity — artificial intelligence.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang added that training AI models was becoming a faster process as they learn to become “multimodal” — that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data — and also “to reason and plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company reported earnings per share — adjusted to exclude one-time items — of US$6.12, well above the US$5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Nvidia Corp rose 6 percent in after-hours trading to US$1,006.89.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s stock has risen more than 200 percent in the past year. (AP)

 Officials in Mexico said at least five people were killed and 50 others injured when a stage collapsed at a campaign event for the Citizens' Movement Party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party's presidential candidate, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, said on social media that a gust of wind caused the stage to collapse at the event in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy enclave near the industrial hub of Monterrey.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 33 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter, and the Dallas Mavericks outlasted the Minnesota Timberwolves for a 108-105 win in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals on Wednesday night in Minneapolis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyrie Irving added 30 points on 12-for-23 shooting for Dallas. Daniel Gafford [10 points, nine rebounds] and Dereck Lively II [nine points, 11 rebounds] narrowly missed double-doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 24 points and made 6 of 9 attempts from beyond the arc to lead the Timberwolves. Anthony Edwards finished with 19 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks outscored Minnesota 26-22 in the fourth quarter to help secure the three-point win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas went on a 13-0 run to seize a 97-89 lead with 7:38 to go. Doncic started the run with seven straight points and he finished it with a pair of free throws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota responded with a 10-1 run to grab a 99-98 edge with 4:39 left. Towns hit a 3-pointer from 28 feet to put the Timberwolves on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a timeout, Edwards made a 3-pointer to increase Minnesota's lead to 102-98 with 3:37 to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks answered with back-to-back 3-pointers by Doncic and P.J. Washington to go ahead 104-102 with 1:56 left. Doncic followed with a step-back jump shot to make it 106-102 with 49.2 seconds to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas maintained the lead the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves clung to an 83-82 advantage at the end of the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gafford threw down a pair of alley-oop dunks to start the second-half scoring for the Mavericks. Derrick Jones Jr. followed a couple minutes later with a dunk that put Dallas on top 67-66 for its first lead since the opening quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota led 62-59 at halftime. McDaniels had 19 points before the break, which marked a playoff career high for him in any half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves led by eight in the final minute of the first half, but Irving scored five points in the last 22 seconds to pull Dallas within three. He finished the scoring by converting a three-point play on a basket and a free throw with 0.7 seconds left. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of the world’s first Doraemon drone show said it’s no coincidence that Hong Kong was chosen as the launchpad for the event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 15-minute drone show will light up Victoria Harbour this Saturday night, serving as a prelude to an exhibition about the beloved Japanese cartoon series in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition is also the first stop on a global tour and also listed on the government's "mega events calendar".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam from AllRightsReserved told RTHK on Thursday that Hong Kong's multi-generational Doraemon fans impressed him and noted that a similar exhibition held here 12 years ago played a key role in this decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Twelve years ago I saw many four-generation families coming to the exhibition. The previous exhibition had exceeded expectations. We didn't even have the term 'mega event' back then, but the exhibition attracted a significant number of tourists specifically for Doraemon. It was truly impressive,” he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say it’s like ‘the seeds were planted’ 12 years ago, and what we want is to come back to Hong Kong this time, to show appreciation for this place and also the fans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Japan, Thailand and the mainland were also considered for the first stop of the global tour but Hong Kong eventually stood out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam didn’t give an exact number of estimated visitors to the exhibition but hopes that it could help boost the local economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command on Thursday started joint military drills surrounding Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drills – which began at 7.45am – are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan Island, as well as areas around the islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li Xi, theatre command spokesperson, said military services including the army, navy, air force and rocket force of the theatre command are being organised to conduct the joint drills, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, from Thursday to Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the drills focus on joint sea-air combat-readiness patrol, joint seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, and joint precision strikes on key targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the drills also serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of "Taiwan independence" forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces. (Xinhua)

    Atalanta halt Leverkusen to win Europa League

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ademola Lookman scored a stunning hat-trick as Atalanta beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 in the Europa League final on Wednesday to win just the second major trophy in their 117-year history and end the German champions' remarkable unbeaten streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lookman, who struggled to establish himself in the English Premier League with Everton, Fulham and Leicester City before reviving his career in Italy under Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini, struck twice inside the first 26 minutes before sealing the win 15 minutes from fulltime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory ended Gasperini's own two-decade long pursuit of major silverware as his side totally outplayed Xabi Alonso's formidable Leverkusen side - or 'Neverlusen' as they had been dubbed after going an incredible 51 games unbeaten.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as they did against Premier League heavyweights Liverpool and three-times finalists Olympique de Marseille in the previous two rounds, Atalanta didn't give their opponents a sniff to mark their first European final with a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen started the game looking decidedly unsure of themselves and some uncharacteristically sloppy play handed the first chance of the game to Gianluca Scamacca, who didn't get enough on his header from a fine Matteo Ruggeri cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an early warning shot and the purposeful Italians struck within minutes when Davide Zappacosta was allowed far too much space down the right before Lookman beat a flatfooted Exequiel Palacios to the cut back to stroke home the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman was mobbed by his team mates and substitutes who were in dreamland 14 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Leverkusen error gifted possession to the Nigeria forward, who skipped past one defender and curled a beautiful right-footed shot into the bottom-right corner from just outside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stunned Germans showed brief flashes of how quickly they can turn it on in attack but little came of it and it was Charles De Ketelaere who came closest on the break as Atalanta did not show a shred of debut final nerves nor any effects from the absence of injured captain Marten de Roon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen swapped defender Josip Stanisic for top scorer Victor Boniface at halftime but it changed little as both sets of travelling fans continued to create the kind of Aviva Stadium noise matched only by some of the Irish rugby teams' famous wins or memorable international soccer nights of years gone by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen had only failed to score once during the run that featured 42 wins in all competitions and 17 goals scored in or after the 90th minute, but the chances of another comeback faded away against the resolute Atalanta backline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman completely extinguished them on the counterattack with another stunning strike into the top corner, this time with his left foot to complete his hat-trick, the sixth in a major European final and first since Jupp Heynckes' for Borussia Moenchengladbach in the 1975 UEFA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was flung into the air by his team mates 15 minutes later when the final whistle blew and the Bergamo club ended the 61-year wait since their 1963 Italian Cup triumph. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday following mixed earnings reports as Federal Reserve meeting minutes highlighted inflation worries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities spent much of the day essentially flat, but tripped into the red after the Fed minutes showed that policy makers were frustrated with the lack of progress in bringing inflation towards the central bank's two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said the concerns were unsurprising given the mindset of the Fed at the May 1 meeting, but that the release served as an excuse for investors to sell after a big rally since the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 39,671.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 0.3 percent to 5,307, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,801, pulling back after two straight records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Target slumped 8.0 percent after reporting a drop of 3.7 percent in comparable sales in the first quarter. The big-box retailer characterised the results as being in line with expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lululemon Athletica dropped 7.2 percent after announcing a number of executive reassignments following the departure of Chief Product Officer Sun Choe, who is leaving for another career opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Moderna surged 13.7 percent after announcing that it had been cleared to present abstracts at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, which begins on May 31 in Chicago. (AFP)

    US says it opposes 'unilateral' Palestine recognition

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said on Wednesday it opposed "unilateral recognition" of a Palestinian state after Ireland, Norway and Spain announced they would establish relations but warned Israel against withholding funds in retaliation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden "has been on the record supporting a two-state solution," his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has been equally emphatic on the record that that two-state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stopped short of criticising the decision to formally recognise the State of Palestine by the three European countries, all close allies of the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Each country is entitled to make its own determinations, but the US position on this is clear," Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has responded angrily, including by withdrawing envoys, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accusing the European nations of offering a "reward for terror."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told Netanyahu that he wants to take retaliatory action including severing an arrangement in which Norway handles funds intended to the Palestinian Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under peace agreements brokered in part by Norway in the 1990s, Israel collects money for the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel has blocked transfers since the aftermath of the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan said that funds should keep going to the Palestinian Authority which the Biden administration wants to strengthen in hopes it can assume control of Gaza from Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's wrong on a strategic basis, because withholding funds destabilises the West Bank," Sullivan said of Israeli moves to stop funds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people which is in Israel's interests, and, I think, it's wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been pushing Israel to move forward on a timeline for a Palestinian state, in part by dangling the prospect of Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Washington vetoed a recent UN Security Council bid to recognise the State of Palestine, saying that recognition could only come through negotiations that take into account Israel's security interests. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic celebrated his 37th birthday on Wednesday with a much-needed win as he gears up for his French Open title defence, progressing to the Geneva quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one downed Germany's Yannick Hanfmann 6-3, 6-3 in the second round at the Parc des Eaux-Vives grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic took a wild card to play in Geneva in a bid to rescue an alarming dip in form ahead of next week's French Open, the second Grand Slam of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd sang "Happy Birthday" to Djokovic as a cake with candles was brought out onto the court following his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lifted the cake and showed it off to the crowd, having a nibble before offering some to the ball boys and girls. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge in Tennessee on Wednesday temporarily halted a foreclosure sale of Graceland, the historic home of Elvis Presley in the southern US state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The auction of the property had been scheduled to take place on Thursday but was paused by Shelby County Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presley's granddaughter, actress Riley Keough, had filed a lawsuit seeking to block the sale of the sprawling estate in Memphis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A company called Naussany Investments & Private Lending was seeking to auction off Graceland, claiming that Keough's mother, Lisa Marie Presley, had put it up as collateral in 2018 for a US$3.8 million loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis's only child, died in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keough, 34, who starred in "Mad Max: Fury Road" and "The Girlfriend Experience," claimed in her lawsuit filed on May 15 that the loan documents were fraudulent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jenkins said he was halting the auction until a trial can be held to determine the authenticity of the documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court will enjoin the sale as requested," the judge said at a live-streamed court hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The real estate is considered unique under Tennessee law and, being unique, the loss of the real estate would be considered irreparable harm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc welcomed the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims," it said in a statement. "There will be no foreclosure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Graceland will continue to operate as it has for the past 42 years, ensuring that Elvis fans from around the world can continue to have a best in class experience when visiting his iconic home." (AFP)

    British PM Rishi Sunak sets July 4 election date

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday set July 4 as the date for a national election that will determine who governs the UK, choosing a day of good economic news to urge voters to give his governing Conservatives another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speculation about an imminent election had mounted throughout the day after Sunak called a Cabinet meeting for Wednesday afternoon – rather than the usual Tuesday – and Foreign Secretary David Cameron flew back early from a trip to Albania to attend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak’s centre-right party has seen its support dwindle steadily after 14 years in power. It has struggled to overcome a series of crises including an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders in the past two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour Party is strongly favoured to defeat Sunak’s party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain must hold a national election by January 2025, and Sunak has repeatedly said it will be in the back end of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stuck to that line on Wednesday, answering a lawmaker’s question about whether there would be a summer vote: “Spoiler alert: There is going to be a general election in the second half of this year.” (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Olympic swimming champion David Wilkie has died at the age of 70, his family said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wilkie, who won 200 metres breaststroke gold for Great Britain at the 1976 Games in Montreal, died on Wednesday after suffering from cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great sadness that the family of David Wilkie MBE announce that he died peacefully surrounded by his family this morning, following his brave battle with cancer," his family said in a statement released to Britain's Press Association news agency:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wilkie also won two Olympic silver medals and three world titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1954 to Scottish parents, Wilkie won his first major medal with a bronze at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, representing Scotland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first World Championship gold followed in 1973 in Belgrade, and two years later he won both 100m and 200m breaststroke titles in Cali, Colombia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his finest performance came at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal where Wilkie, who had been training and studying at the University of Miami, broke the US dominance of Olympic swimming by winning 200m breaststroke gold with an outstanding swim, breaking the existing world record by over three seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the only non-American to win a gold in the men's swimming events in Montreal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wilkie retired from competitive swimming soon after the Games, at the age of 22, and subsequently became a successful businessman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is survived by his wife, Helen, and children Natasha and Adam. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Existing home sales in the United States crept lower in April as mortgage rates remained elevated, industry data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales of previously owned homes dipped by 1.9 percent from March, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million, said the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected a slight uptick last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Home sales changed little overall, but the upper-end market is experiencing a sizeable gain due to more supply coming onto the market," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total housing inventory at the end of April was up nine percent from March, and was 16.3 percent higher than the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, the central bank continues to hold rates steady as it seeks to stamp out price increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of May 16, the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02 percent, up from 6.39 percent a year prior, according to home loan finance firm Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-May 2021, the rate was around three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher rates have weighed on transactions, as homeowners who locked in lower rates previously remained reluctant to enter the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, home sales were also 1.9 percent lower in April, NAR data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median sales price in April rose 5.7 percent from a year ago to US$407,600 – the highest since June 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, however, "the pace of price increases should taper off since more housing inventory is becoming available," Yun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage demand is expected to remain tepid in the near term, given that long-term rates are still elevated, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a recent note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect a decline in long-term rates over the next couple of months, but we also expect the labour market will start to look much weaker, slowing the growth in the pool of potential homebuyers," Pantheon added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Legislative Council on Wednesday passed an amendment bill to the city’s wildlife protection law, raising the maximum penalty for illegally feeding wild animals to HK$100,000 and a one-year jail term.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Wild Animals Protection (Amendment) Bill also includes a new fixed penalty for illegal animal feeding, at HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the ban on illegal feeding would be expanded to cover feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, the maximum penalty for illegally feeding wild animals is a fine of HK$10,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amendments, which will take effect from August 1, are aimed at boosting deterrence against illegal feeding activities in the SAR, protecting wild animals and improving environmental hygiene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the bill, the scope of government enforcement officers has expanded,” Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Together with various enforcement departments, a guideline has been put in place, and there will also be comprehensive training to cover identification of wild animals and process, as well as the standards of evidence collection.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that joint departmental operations will be arranged if necessary to ensure the effectiveness and consistency of law enforcement, and authorities will continue installing CCTV cameras at “black spots”.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan began a 10-day trip to France and the US on Wednesday, in a joint business trip with delegates from Macau and the Guangdong provincial government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During their stay in the French capital of Paris, they will attend the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and Europe (France) Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference, to promote business opportunities in the bay area, as well as Hong Kong’s role as a “super connector” and “super value-adder”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister will also meet the local political and business communities to explore opportunities for greater collaboration between Hong Kong and France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group will then fly to California and visit San Francisco and Berkeley, where they will attend a Bay-to-Bay Dialogue, as well as a high-level event on the climate, next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan will attend a business luncheon organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in California’s bay area, to attract US firms to Hong Kong, especially those in the innovation and technology sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those joining the trip are the SAR’s commerce minister Algernon Yau, transport chief Lam Sai-hung, Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan, and the Greater Bay Area development commissioner Maisie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan will return to the city on June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong will be Acting Financial Secretary during Chan’s absence.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 1,000 drones will light up the sky over Victoria Harbour this Saturday in the world's first Doraemon drone show.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-minute show will feature characters from the popular Japanese cartoon series as well as Doraemon's gadgets, such as the Anywhere Door and the Take-Copter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam from the event organiser, AllRightsReserved, told RTHK that Doraemon holds a special place in the hearts of people from different generations, as it's a character that brings back cherished childhood memories for many.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the drones will tell a story accompanied by the voices of Hong Kong's dubbing artists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drone show is a prelude to a larger Doraemon and Friends exhibition in July.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of paddlers are to make a splash in Victoria Harbour during next month’s Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races, with the event expected to draw crowds of spectators.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The races, jointly organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong China Dragon Boat Association, will be held on June 15 and 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 athletes from a dozen countries and regions, including China, Thailand and Singapore, will take part. Teams from the Hong Kong and Macau SARs will also compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants this year will also have a chance to join special races commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourism body will also host a drone show for the Tuen Ng Festival and a pyrotechnic display on the first evening of the races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The whole event, we believe, would help to enable our Hong Kong community, our residents, as well as our tourists [to have a] tremendous, happy and interesting experience,” said the board’s executive director Dane Cheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We expect it would draw around 130,000 visitors and patrons to this event, and together, we would be hoping that everyone would enjoy and have a good time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said the festivities, including the races and other shows, carry a price tag of HK$17 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested 100 people who were allegedly involved in cases of fraud and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 17 and 75, were involved in 82 cases related to investments, online employment and online romance scams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the cases involved a total of HK$180 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief inspector Cheng Ki-fung said the suspects were mostly stooge account holders of syndicates, who were responsible for collecting or managing the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said one of the cases involved 54 victims who had bought coupons online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The suspects employed many different defrauding tricks. Different kinds of coupons appeared in different cases. They also sold different coupons during different festivals," Cheng said.

    Three European nations to recognise Palestine as state

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain, Ireland, and Norway say they will recognise Palestine as a state at the end of May. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754225_1_20240522153130.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several major European countries on Wednesday announced they would recognise Palestine as a state at the end of the month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Norway and Spain said they would formally recognise Palestine as a state from May 28 onwards while Ireland also made a similar pledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel recalled its envoys from Ireland and Norway for "urgent consultations" in response to their decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision to recognise a Palestinian state undermined Israel's right to self-defence and efforts to return the 128 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Authority and its rival group Hamas both welcomed the recognition of a Palestinian state by the three countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most Western governments, including the United States, say they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement is reached on thorny issues like its final borders and the status of Jerusalem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez charged that his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign of "pain and destruction" in the Gaza Strip was now putting the two-state solution in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said "recognition of Palestine is a means of supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel "barbaric", but added that "a two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the memorial service of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Foreign Ministry, Zhang, as President Xi Jinping's special representative, will attend the service in the capital Tehran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, huge crowds of Iranians thronged the streets of Tehran on Wednesday for the funeral procession of Raisi and his entourage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the city centre, mourners clutching portraits of Raisi gathered in and around the University of Tehran, where Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flanked by top officials, Khamenei said prayers over the coffins of the dead, who also included Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi's helicopter crashed into a fog-shrouded mountainside in northwestern Iran on Sunday as he headed back to the city of Tabriz after attending a ceremony on the border with Azerbaijan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A huge search and rescue operation was launched, involving help from Turkey, Russia and the European Union. Iranian state television announced Raisi's death early on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi, who was widely expected to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader, was 63.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the capital, huge banners have gone up hailing the late president as "the martyr of service", while others bade "farewell to the servant of the disadvantaged".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tehran residents received phone messages urging them to "attend the funeral of the martyr of service".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the university, the coffins will be driven to the huge Enghelab Square in the city centre and on to Azadi Square, state media said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Funeral rites for Raisi and his entourage began on Tuesday with processions through Tabriz and the Shiite clerical centre of Qom drawing tens of thousands of black-clad mourners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Tehran, the bodies will be taken to Iran's second city of Mashhad, Raisi's hometown in the northeast, where he will be buried on Thursday evening after funeral rites at the Imam Reza shrine. (AFP and agencies)

  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner launched a probe into Worldcoin after raiding six of its premises around Hong Kong in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, provides a digital passport with free Worldcoin cryptocurrency tokens, but participants first have to have their faces and eyeballs scanned to verify they are human and unique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 8,300 people in Hong Kong signed up, but many didn't know what they were agreeing to and the data taken from them was unnecessary and excessive, said Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) Ada Chung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worldcoin was found to have breached several parts of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, including by failing to explain to participants the risks regarding disclosure of their biometric data and by planning to keep personal information for up to 10 years in order to use it to train artificial intelligence models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy commissioner said another breach was that Worldcoin did not provide information to participants in Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The PCPD was of the view that participants using Chinese as native language would not be able to clearly understand the relevant policies and practices, terms and conditions of the Worldcoin project, and hence there was a lack of transparency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog said members of the public should contact it immediately if they find that Worldcoin is continuing to carry out iris-scanning in the territory.

 Renowned Sherpa mountain guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for a record 30th time on Wednesday, completing his second climb this month to the top of the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rita reached the 8,849-metre summit at 7:49am local time, according to Khim Lal Gautam, a Nepalese government official at Everest base camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first ascent of this year's climbing season was on May 12 guiding foreign clients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also climbed Mount Everest twice last year, setting the record for the most climbs of the world's highest mountain on the first and extending it less than a week later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His closest competitor for the most climbs of Mount Everest is fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa, who has 27 successful ascents of the mountain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rita first climbed Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. (AP)

    Schools, cars burn in N Caledonia before Macron visit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsonists torched schools and hundreds of cars overnight in New Caledonia, officials said on Wednesday, as French President Emmanuel Macron embarked on a surprise visit aiming to end nine days of deadly riots on the French Pacific archipelago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Macron left Paris on Tuesday on a flight to the troubled territory, a popular holiday destination where roads are now littered with charred vehicles, and scores of shops, schools and other buildings are in cinders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clashes have left six people dead and hundreds injured since unrest erupted on May 13 on the Pacific islands, home to 270,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities said the violence had eased since 1,050 troops, tactical police and national security reinforcements from Paris were deployed, including to "highly sensitive" areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, two primary schools and 300 cars in a dealership were torched in the territory's capital Noumea during the night, the mayor's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deadliest unrest in four decades has been blamed on French plans to give voting rights to thousands of non-indigenous residents, which Indigenous Kanaks say will dilute their votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An official close to the president said Macron aims to "listen to, talk and hold discussions with New Caledonian elected officials" in an attempt to restore order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He wants to "give answers to the many legitimate questions Caledonians are asking, both on the reconstruction side and the political side", the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But one Kanak manning an unofficial roadblock north of the capital Noumea said Macron needed to understand Indigenous opposition to the vote reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know why our fate is being discussed by people who don't even live here," said the 52-year-old, who gave only his first name Mike. (AFP)

    MTR projects up for tender again

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the MTR Corporation on Wednesday said the railway giant had been successful in its recent property sales with the market picking up, adding the Tung Chung East project would be tendered again, after the rail firm failed to receive any bids last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rex Auyeung and Jacob Kam, the firm’s CEO, were speaking to reporters ahead of the company's annual general meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Tung Chung East Station development project will be tendered again in the next 12 months. As for the Siu Ho Wan Depot Site project, we are carrying out preliminary work and we will announce tender details when we are ready," said Auyeung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Kam said last year's station flooding was due to the impact of flash flooding, not maintenance problems, adding the recently installed flood sensors at 26 stations would now allow for a prompt response by staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the railway operator had put measures in place for dealing with the upcoming typhoon season to ensure the safety of its staff and passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During typhoon [signal] No. 9 or above, all train services on the open sections will be suspended. Now, if there are still trains out there running on the open sections during the transition from typhoon 8 to typhoon 9 or above, we will of course try to continue those services already on the open sections to the original destination, or at least to the nearest stations with enough space to let the passengers off the trains so that they can stay in a safe place until the weather improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To do that, we have actually in place our train crew, our maintenance staff, and our station staff to be prepared for that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for plans by Shenzhen authorities to redevelop the control point at Lo Wu to allow for smoother connectivity between the two locations, Kam said the two sides were still discussing the details and the MTR would cooperate when a decision had been made.

    Govt to submit fire safety amendment bill in July

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk says the government plans higher fines for people who ignore fire safety orders." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754199_1_20240522131156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk on Wednesday said the government expects to submit an amendment bill to Legco in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five people were killed in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan in April, sparking concerns about inadequate safety facilities in old buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco meeting, Cheuk said the authorities propose raising the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said financial penalties alone would be ineffective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to imprison people to serve a deterrent effect because Hong Kong people don't care about fines, but they certainly don't want to be jailed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk said the authorities were looking into including more provisions, including jail terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If someone tries to obstruct the owner's corporation to carry out repair works, is uncooperative or tries to obstruct certain work intentionally, we're considering whether to impose penalties including imprisonment," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the government would not comment on the death of a British man accused by the UK of spying for Hong Kong, while another official said the city’s overseas trade offices would continue their work to promote the SAR and facilitate trade and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They were speaking to reporters following a Legco antechamber meeting, after Matthew Trickett was found dead in a park west of London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett, who was 37, was one of three people arrested earlier this month and charged by UK authorities for allegedly helping to collect intelligence for Hong Kong. Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in London, is a co-defendant in the national security case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Bernard Chan declined to address questions on whether the ETO in London was monitoring the activities of HongKongers in the UK, saying officials would not address online rumours or baseless accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that the trade offices would continue to carry out their lawful duties undeterred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The ETO’s task is to liaise with the local government, think tanks, different sectors and all walks of life to try to improve or facilitate or foster the cooperation on trade and investment, and also in the area of art and culture. We will continue to liaise with the local government to tell the good stories of Hong Kong,” he said.

    Corruption erodes faith in rule of law: chief judge

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's head judge on Wednesday said corruption erodes public faith in governments and the rule of law and discourages people from making investments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering a keynote speech at an anti-corruption symposium, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said corruption was "the misuse of power" that led to "some not being subject or held accountable under the same rules", placing them above the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption erodes public faith in governments and institutions, where the rule of law is built on public trust," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even the appearance of corruption, never mind corruption on a micro scale, will lead to the erosion of the public's belief in the rule of law. Therefore, if for no other reasons than the upholding of the rule of law in a society, it is vital that corruption be subject to continuing vigilance and efforts to combat it at all levels and in all forms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also argued against claims there were potentially economic benefits to corruption, calling such views "exceedingly short-term and narrow".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption is not merely the product of a bad institution, it actually helps create bad institutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are likely to be discouraged by corruption from making investments, as they would prefer fair, transparent and competitive markets in order to protect their capital."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 36 points, including 10 in overtime after Jaylen Brown's tying 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Boston Celtics rallied just in time for a 133-128 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jrue Holiday added a season-high 28 points and Brown finished with 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who knocked down 13 3-pointers and scored 56 points in the paint against a Celtics team still playing without 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who twice turned it over with a three-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown made them pay for the second one, hitting a 3 from the corner with Siakam right in his face to tie it at 117.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana went back ahead 123-121 when Haliburton hit all three free throws after being fouled with 1:46 remaining. Tatum then muscled in a layup and was fouled by T.J. McConnell. He completed the three-point play to put Boston ahead for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers turned it over again, this time by Haliburton. The ball found its way to Tatum at the top of key. He pumped, sidestepped a defender and sunk a 3 to make it 127-123 with 43 seconds left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Derrick White and Siakam traded layups. Holiday was fouled and hit two free throws to give Boston a 131-125 cushion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is at the forefront of the international fight against corruption, Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday, while vowing to sustain the territory's "pioneering role" in anti-graft work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told the opening ceremony of a symposium in Wan Chai that the SAR has a clean and efficient government and zero tolerance for corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-day event, co-hosted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities, attracted more than 500 participants, including anti-corruption experts, legal professionals and academics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong maintains a robust regulatory regime in line with international standards, and is renowned globally for its clean and efficient government, level-playing field for doing business, sound rule of law, a judiciary with independent judicial power, and zero tolerance for corruption," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the anti-corruption body had championed the fight against corruption in the city for half a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a priority of the Hong Kong SAR government to sustain our pioneering role in combating corruption. We are pleased and proud to back the ICAC in widening its international network and cooperating with overseas counterparts," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed, as well, to ensuring that our legal framework and anti-corruption institutions, as well as public and private sector governance, reflect the highest international obligations and standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Woo, the commissioner of the anti-graft body, told the same event that the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption had organised 70 training courses for more than 40 agencies around the world since it was established in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there would be a training programme on the use of innovation and technology to combat and prevent corruption following the symposium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A unique feature of this training programme is a three-day study tour to the city of Changsha of China. Participants will witness first-hand China's latest development and anti-corruption initiative during the trip," Woo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the symposium was the signing of memoranda of understanding between the ICAC and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as anti-corruption authorities from Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British police are investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time champions Kolkata Knight Riders pummelled Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets in the qualifier to waltz into the final of the Indian Premier League [IPL] on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mitchell Starc produced a three-wicket burst to rattle Hyderabad, who managed a below-par 159 before they were all out with three balls left in their innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kolkata romped home with 6.2 overs to spare after unbeaten half-centuries by Venkatesh Iyer [51] and skipper Shreyas Iyer [58].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hyderabad will get another chance to make Sunday's final when they clash with the winners of Wednesday's eliminator between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Starc entered the league as its most expensive player following his US$2.98 million deal with Kolkata, but he struggled for wickets in the first half of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-arm seamer was bang on the money on Tuesday though as he removed compatriot Travis Head for a duck and sent back Nitish Kumar Reddy and Shahbaz Ahmed in successive deliveries to rock Hyderabad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahul Tripathi [55], Heinrich Klaasen [32] and skipper Pat Cummins [30] took Hyderabad past the 150-mark but it was not enough to test Kolkata's formidable batting lineup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Sunil Narine gave Kolkata a flying start before Venkatesh and Shreyas plundered 97 runs off 44 balls to seal an easy victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rajasthan Royals will take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the eliminator at the same venue on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq climbed to a fresh record on Tuesday following a choppy session after a smattering of mixed earnings and muted Federal Reserve commentary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There really isn't much economic news to speak of," said Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin, who pointed to Wednesday's earnings report from Nvidia as one of the highlights of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Nvidia rose 0.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,832, up 0.2 percent for the day and a record for the second straight session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones also advanced 0.2 percent to 19,872, along with the S&P 500, which stood at 5,321.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cresset's Ablin said the stock market is probably "overbought" at this point, adding that, "relative to bonds, the stock market is probably the most expensive it's been since the financial crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices scored records last week following data showing a moderation in inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Lowe's dropped 1.9 percent after earnings topped analyst expectations. However, revenues for the home-improvement retailer fell about four percent to US$21.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump Media & Technology Group slumped 8.7 percent after reporting a net loss of US$327.6 million in the quarter ending March 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disney nudged up 0.1 percent following news the company's animation studio Pixar is laying off about 14 percent of its staff. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians evacuate Kamal Adwan hospital following an Israeli strike. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754129_1_20240522034215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Gaza's last two functioning hospitals, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan, are barely operational, doctors and the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday with the Israel-Hamas war now in its eighth month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hospital officials said Israeli forces had fired on the facilities and that snipers had been deployed near one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today marks the third day of the siege on Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza," said the hospital's acting director Dr Mohammad Saleh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He reported that Israeli forces had been "firing at the hospital buildings" and that "snipers" have taken up position in nearby houses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh said the "southern wall" of the hospital "has been destroyed" and "all medical staff and patients" are inside the hospital wards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moving around the hospital was "extremely difficult," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But staff still had to transfer water "from the second building to the first one because the occupation (Israeli) forces hit the first building with a shell on the fifth floor yesterday (Monday), destroying the water tanks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva that "148 hospital staff, 22 patients and their companions are trapped inside" the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO regularly visited Al-Awda in April to deliver medical supplies and fuel, but Ghebreyesus also reported snipers aiming at the building and artillery hitting the fifth floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dounia Dekhili, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Gaza, said "nothing is coming in or out" of the hospital because of fears of sniper fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our operating theatre supervisor has been hiding for a few days, he can hear gunshots," Dekhili said after speaking to the man inside Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh did not report any casualties, but said the episode was reminiscent of the last Israeli military operation in the area of the northern Gaza hospital, which is located next to the Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Israeli forces besieged Al-Awda for days, killing two staff and detaining others, MSF reported at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has yet to comment on the operation in Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday also saw patients and staff being evacuated from another north Gaza hospital, Kamal Adwan, said its director Dr Hossam Abu Safia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the hospital is being evacuated of the wounded, patients, and medical staff," he said, adding that "there are several patients that the medical teams have not been able to evacuate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "the reception and emergency entrance gate of Kamal Adwan Hospital was targeted by an artillery shell from the Israeli army," as soldiers advanced towards the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the Palestinian Territories, said on Tuesday from Jerusalem that the hospital's intensive care unit reception area had been hit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the moment, 20 health staff and 13 patients remain," Peeperkorn said, adding that "these are ... functional hospitals we cannot afford to lose," referring to both Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the only two functional hospitals remaining in northern Gaza. Ensuring their ability to deliver health services is imperative," Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli troops have previously raided other medical facilities in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, the territory's largest hospital, now reduced to rubble after a March operation, the WHO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military accuses Hamas of using hospitals as command centres to plan and launch attacks against its forces, a charge the militant group denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza Strip has been gripped by war since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,647 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Trump doesn't testify, defence rests case in trial

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's defence lawyers rested their case on Tuesday – without the former president following through on a vow to testify – as the judge planned jury deliberations in the historic criminal trial for early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After approximately five weeks, 19 witnesses, reams of documents and sometimes salacious testimony, judgment day in the first ever trial of a former US president was drawing closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York law means the trial has not been shown on television and experts are divided on whether the airing of Trump's dirty laundry is having much of a political impact. However, with a clash against President Joe Biden less than six months away, the looming jury verdict represents a moment of acute peril for the Republican.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Juan Merchan told jurors that closing arguments would take place next Tuesday when each side would make their pitch to the 12 New Yorkers who will ultimately decide Trump's fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will expect you will begin your deliberations hopefully at some point on Wednesday," Merchan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers have sought to undermine key testimony against the former president, who is accused of illegally covering up hush money paid to a porn star over an alleged encounter that could have derailed his successful 2016 White House bid against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Robert Costello was grilled on emails he sent to prosecution star witness Michael Cohen after the FBI raided him in 2018, with Trump's lawyers seeking to undermine Cohen and the prosecution case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costello sparred with Merchan on Monday, prompting the magistrate to rebuke him for poor courtroom etiquette. Trump, in one of his regular tirades outside the courtroom, accused Merchan of being a "tyrant" in what he claimed was a "show trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Monday, both sides asked their final questions of Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and ultra-loyal fixer who eventually turned on his boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lawyer Todd Blanche also probed Cohen's loyalty to Trump and then to the prosecution, looking to show jurors that Cohen is self-serving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche vied to goad Cohen, who has a reputation for a short temper that could have hurt him on the stand – but the witness largely maintained his composure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Blanche finished with him, the prosecution returned for redirect, with prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asking Cohen what the whole experience has meant for him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire life has been turned upside down," Cohen said, emotion in his voice. "I lost my law licence, my financial security..., my family's happiness... just to name a few."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout the trial, which has upended the political and legal order, Trump has complained his 2024 election campaign for another White House term is being stymied by the weeks-long court proceedings, which he has to attend every day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did so again on Monday, complaining to journalists he's "not allowed to have anything to do with politics because I'm sitting in a very freezing cold, dark room for the last four weeks. It's very unfair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling the case politicised, a coterie of leading Republicans have stood in the wings behind him as he gives remarks to reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The growing list includes several lawmakers eyeing Trump's vice presidential pick, including Ohio Senator JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet despite the palace intrigue and courtroom drama, the charges ultimately hinge on financial records, and whether falsifying them was done with intent to sway the 2016 presidential vote. (AFP)

 Mauricio Pochettino has left his job as Chelsea manager by mutual consent after one season in charge, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "On behalf of everyone at Chelsea, we would like to express our gratitude to Mauricio for his service this season," sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said in a statement.

  Pochettino joined Chelsea ahead of the 2023-24 season when he replaced interim manager Frank Lampard as the club's new owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital looked to freshen things up at Stamford Bridge after finishing 12th in the previous campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Chelsea started the season poorly and found themselves in the bottom half of the standings despite spending more than any club in Europe, Pochettino managed to guide the London club to sixth in the Premier League standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speculation had been rife that the former Paris St Germain and Tottenham Hotspur boss would be gone after just one year in charge but Pochettino remained tight-lipped about his future when asked after their final game of the season on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to the Chelsea ownership group and sporting directors for the opportunity to be part of this football club's history," Pochettino said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club is now well positioned to keep moving forward in the Premier League and Europe in the years to come." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Victims of a decades-long contaminated blood scandal that has killed about 3,000 people in Britain will start receiving final compensation payments this year, the government announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people, including children, were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood between the 1970s and early 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims are still dying from what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It follows similar scandals including the wrongful prosecution for fraud of hundreds of UK Post Office workers because of faulty software, and the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which falsely blamed football fans for the tragedy that killed 97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bombshell report released on Monday found the tainted blood affair was covered up by successive governments and health officials, and largely could have been avoided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued a "wholehearted and unequivocal" apology and promised compensation for everyone affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Updating parliament on those plans on Tuesday, government minister John Glen said victims would receive interim payments of £210,000 (US$267,000) within 90 days, before the final scheme becomes operational.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our expectation is that final payments will start before the end of the year," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Glen said there was "no restriction" on the total cost of the package, which according to media reports could total more than £10 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friends, family members and carers of those infected will also be eligible for compensation, he announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compensation will be paid to the estate of any person who has died from the scandal and money will be distributed either in a lump sum or via regular payments, Glen added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Brian Langstaff's report, running to more than 2,500 pages, found a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It concluded that blood donors were not screened properly, the risk of AIDS was downplayed and too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak's official spokesman told reporters on Tuesday: "We must fundamentally rebalance the system so that we finally address this pattern so familiar from other inquiries like Hillsborough where innocent victims have to fight for decades just to be believed and heard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work together across government, our health services and civil society to ensure that nothing like this can ever happen in our country again." (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks dipped early on Tuesday, edging back from recent records following muted Federal Reserve commentary and mixed earnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.

  Among companies reporting results, Macy's climbed after its report, while both Lowe's and Palo Alto Networks pulled back.

  "Markets are hunting for catalysts and drifting as they wait," said a note from Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

    Man Utd's Rashford left out of England's Euros squad

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eight goals in 42 appearances for his club this season has not been enough to earn Marcus Rashford an England place. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754117_1_20240521234042.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marcus Rashford paid for his poor season as the Manchester United forward was left out of England boss Gareth Southgate's provisional 33-man squad for Euro 2024 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and Chelsea skipper Reece James were among the other big names to miss out on the squad, that must be trimmed to a maximum of 26 before the tournament in Germany begins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is rewarded for the Eagles' brilliant end to the Premier League season with his first-ever call up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite and Liverpool duo Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones are the other uncapped players selected with Southgate short on defensive options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England face Bosnia and Herzegovina on June 3 and Iceland four days later before jetting off for Germany, where they are one of the favourites to win the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wealth of options available to Southgate in attacking areas means Rashford misses out on a major international tournament for the first time since the 2014 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rashford has scored just eight times in 42 appearances for his club this season and only recently returned from injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henderson's move to Ajax in January after a short spell in Saudi Arabia has not done enough to earn the 33-year-old a place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same goes for Jadon Sancho despite his renaissance on his return to Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund on loan from United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raheem Sterling and Kalvin Phillips were also overlooked despite shining for Southgate in the past at major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, who fired Manchester City to the Premier League title on Sunday, and Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka are included as part of a fearsome collection of creative talent to supply England's all-time top goalscorer Harry Kane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's men begin their quest to win a major tournament for the first time in 58 years against Serbia on June 16 before facing Denmark and Slovenia in Group C.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squad:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), James Trafford (Burnley)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defenders: Kyle Walker, John Stones (both Manchester City), Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire (both Manchester United), Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Jarell Quansah, Joe Gomez (both Liverpool), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Kieran Trippier (Newcastle), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Lewis Dunk (Brighton)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Midfielders: Declan Rice (Arsenal), Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Trent Alexander-Arnold, Curtis Jones (both Liverpool)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forwards: Harry Kane (Bayern Munich/GER), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), James Maddison (Tottenham), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid/ESP), Phil Foden, Jack Grealish (both Manchester City), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace) (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau has proposed that students taking the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education economics exam can skip part of the test from 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It came after the bureau announced that students would be allowed to only take the compulsory test for the Chinese history DSE exam from 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a circular published on Monday, the bureau said the requirement for students to choose one of the elective tests would be removed for the economics DSE exam, and that students only sitting the compulsory paper would be rewarded a score of level 5 at most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said this would allow students to focus on studying for the compulsory part of the exam to enhance learning effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the measure would be implemented at secondary 4 starting from the 2025-26 school year, and would apply to the 2028 DSE exams.

    1 dead after Singapore Airlines flight hits turbulence

<div class="itemFullText">
 One passenger was killed and 30 injured after a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence en route on Tuesday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Bangkok, officials and the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We deeply apologise for the traumatic experience that our passengers and crew members suffered on this flight," the airline said, adding it was working with Thai authorities to provide all necessary assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One male passenger died, Kittipong Kittikachorn, Director of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, said. Eighteen people have been hospitalised and 12 are being treated in hospitals, Singapore Airlines said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately possible to reconstruct the incident from publicly available tracking data, but a spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said it was analysing data at around 3:49 pm Hong Kong time, which shows the plane tilting upwards and return to its cruising altitude over the space of a minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger who was on the flight said that the incident involved the sensation of rising then falling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Suddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking so I started bracing for what was happening, and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling," Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on board the flight said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said with regard to data showing a drop in height, "our initial thinking is the turbulence event is prior to the standard descent from 37,000 to 31,000 feet. That appears to just be a flight level change in preparation for landing".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Boeing 777-300ER plane with 211 passengers and 18 crew was headed to Singapore when it made the emergency landing, the airline said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore news outlet CNA carried blurry pictures supplied by readers that it said appeared to be from the flight. They showed anxious passengers clinging to seats, with oxygen masks hanging from above, personal items strewn across the aisle and rubbish spilled on the floor of the cabin crew area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suvarnabhumi airport said the plane requested an emergency landing at 4:35 pm Hong Kong time and landed at 4:51 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognised as one of the world's leading airlines and is a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines has had seven accidents according to records by the Aviation Safety Network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

  According to the company that operated the mine, nine people were trapped, with four of them rescued later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong's business school on Tuesday said it was investigating "a small number of cases" in which people submitted forged documents to gain admission to the school.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said it had found that some agencies, which claimed to offer "guaranteed admission", had forged application documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it would not tolerate any acts of dishonesty or academic misconduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to academic integrity and to creating a fair learning environment," the school said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we understand that securing a place in a top graduate programme is not easy, it is regrettable that this competition has attracted individuals who resort to deceitful means in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said that if any of the cases were confirmed to be true, it would take the necessary disciplinary and legal action, including withdrawing offers of admission and referring the cases to the relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One HKU student told RTHK she was surprised that some people could cheat their way into the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's shocking to me...it's quite unfair to other students who have worked very hard to get into the school, while others can just fake it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another student said the university should ensure fairness in admission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For future students who want to go to the university...the school needs to have a stricter process for checking their certificates," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued its Red Rainstorm Warning Signal at 2.50pm on Tuesday, after the amber signal had been in force for almost five hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The observatory said heavy rain was continuing to affect the city, and a band of thundery showers over the southern part of the territory was edging closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the downpours were particularly heavy on Lantau, where there could be serious flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said more than 90 millimetres of hourly rainfall was recorded around noon in Cheung Sha on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said the city's schools should ensure that conditions were safe before allowing students to leave for the day.

    Walled City film set could become tourist hotspot

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the government is considering turning the film set of local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" into a tourist site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing on Hong Kong's mega events, Wong said the movie set, which resembles the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City, has been well maintained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With regards to the set used in the movie 'Walled In', discussions are taking place. The set has been dismantled, but it's still there. They've been keeping it in rather good condition," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions are ongoing as to whether they can let us have some parts of the set and it will be put up for display at a suitable location in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong will host 106 mega events in the latter half of this year, a couple less than the 108 organised in the first six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the events still to come are expected to attract more visitors compared to those already held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of events taking place in the first half of this year is actually more or less similar to the number of events taking place in the second half. But in terms of scale, we noted that some of the events in the second half actually have a much larger capacity in terms of attracting visitors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that the number of visitors coming to Hong Kong for those mega events will actually be bigger than those in the first half."

    Pay rises dip this year: Jobsdb

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, says more young people are hoping to work on the mainland.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Salary increases this year are slightly lower than last year, according to a new report by Jobsdb.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The employment platform polled nearly 3,400 workers between February and  March, and found that their average pay rise in 2024 was 3.2 percent. That's almost one percentage point lower than last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employees in analytics had the biggest increase at 7.2 percent, followed by legal and compliance, and engineering at about five percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers in the design, retail sales and manufacturing sectors were at the bottom end with increments of less than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, said the lower pay rise should not be a concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is roughly within the range of salary increases in Hong Kong in the last ten years, and this number is also above inflation, which was roughly around two percent in March,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that industries like hospitality and tourism had benefited from the rebounded in visitor numbers, and their staff had a better than average salary rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We do see a significant improvement in the salary and benefits package within the hospitality and tourism job functions. Firstly, within this segment, there's an average increase of 4.2 percent," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And over 80 percent of those surveyed within this segment actually received salary increments, so that's a pretty positive outlook.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said that jobseekers, particularly those under 25, had shown more interest in working on the mainland which has become the second most popular destination after Australia for Hongkongers seeking work outside the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The policies implemented by the Hong Kong government to encourage more integration with the Greater Bay Area are probably showing some results, increasing the awareness of young people looking to work in the GBA,” he said.

    RAISe+ results will be published soon: Paul Chan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government will soon release the results of a scheme aimed at promoting the commercialisation of scientific research results and matching university projects with reliable investors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Greater Bay Area Science Forum - Hong Kong Forum at the University of Hong Kong, Chan said the authorities have been rolling out various measures to promote the commercialisation of scientific research results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the measures, he said, is the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) that was launched last October and is aimed at promoting collaboration between the government, universities, as well as the technology and research industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very pleased to report to you that the results of the first round of evaluation results of the scheme will be published within this month, and we will fund over 20 projects covering various fields, including health and medical sciences, new materials, new energy, and artificial intelligence robots et cetera,” Chan told the participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that authorities will also conduct more collaboration with cities in the Greater Bay Area, especially the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, to create a vigorous technology and innovation ecosystem, while matching global capital with scientific institutions and universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the government will prepare and establish a third InnoHK research and development cluster in the second half of this year, to ramp up the SAR's tech transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new cluster will focus on advanced manufacturing, materials, energy, and sustainable development, while the existing clusters focus on healthcare-related technologies, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, could play a positive role in guiding funds by being a ‘super connector’. The innovation and technology industries as well as the finance industry in the Greater Bay Area can support each other, and they are equivalent to combining the competitive strengths of the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that over 50 key enterprises, many in the innovation and tech fields, have been attracted to the SAR since late 2022, and it's estimated they will bring in investments worth more than HK$40 billion and create 13,000 jobs in the coming few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 120,000 individuals have recently arrived in the SAR via the government’s various talent import schemes, with 20 percent of them working in the innovation and technology industries, Chan said.

    CE warns against citizen sting ops on Uber drivers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee urged people without proper training to refrain from mounting sting operations, after taxi drivers went undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cabbies raised eyebrows and caused controversy by travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police had been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee warned there were risks for people taking matters into their own hands, and that they should refer the issue to law enforcement officers instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These operations should be undertaken by law enforcement agencies. And the law enforcement agencies that take these undercover actions will have to abide by rules and regulations. The officers involved have been well-trained. They act within the framework of the law," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need training to handle emergency situations. Without proper training and without adequate legal understanding, I advise people not to do it, because they may break the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted the Transport and Logistics Bureau would report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services in July.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that clear key performance indicators (KPIs) must be set for the development and operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, adding that government money must be spent carefully.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment ahead of the weekly Exco meeting after the chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, said museums at the arts hub may have to reduce the days they are open unless more funds are secured in the next year or so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government is in communication with the authority regarding viable funding options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have high expectations of the successful operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, and it has been creating value for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In many areas, it has been doing a job which satisfies the expectations and wishes of the community and the government, but we want to ensure that there will be a long-term viable financing plan with good KPIs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that the district was designed to be self-financing following its initial endowment from the government.

    Govt to release findings on waste charging next week

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government attached importance to people's views on the waste charging scheme, as officials prepare to present their plans to the Legislative Council next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a survey by the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao found that more than 90 percent of the 30,000 people polled were against the pay-as-you-throw scheme, while more than 70 percent said it should be scrapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme has been on trial since April in 14 different locations, including at homes, shops and restaurants. Officials had previously said it remained to be seen whether a full roll-out would take place as planned on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the government was assessing the experience gained during the trial and the challenges that may arise in implementing the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed the government was taking the views of society seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In my opinion, a policy that would affect more than seven million citizens should be carefully considered. Even though the law was drafted before this government took office, we should still consider how to implement it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will explain to the Legislative Council next week what we have learnt from the pilot, the problems we have identified and the feedback we have received from the community, including through the media."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said internet service providers have been complying with a court injunction against the protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said hyperlinks to the song could no longer be found on local platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've noted that there's no link shown on any local platform relating to the song, and also Google Search doesn't show any link to the song in question either," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to monitor the situation to see whether there is any non-compliance with the court order. If we notice such instances, then we will notify the platform on the contents of the court order."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction against the protest song, banning anyone with seditious intent from playing or performing it on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said last week that it would comply with the court ruling, restricting viewing of 32 banned links related to the song in Hong Kong.
