<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted a temporary injunction order banning the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their decision, judges Jeremy Poon, Carlye Chu and Anthea Pang said they agreed with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said criminal law alone could not achieve the purpose of safeguarding national security regarding the matter, since it is not practicable to bring proceedings against "unidentifiable" people online who commit offences in relation to the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that there had been "widespread and persistent" flouting of the law before and especially after the national security law came into force in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such is the seriousness of the criminal problems that the court must intervene immediately to prevent the continuation of the prevailing unlawful state of affairs; otherwise any further damage to national security would likely to be irreparable," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said the injunction was necessary to persuade internet platforms to remove "problematic" content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They agreed with a lower court ruling earlier that the injunction may have “chilling effects”, but said it has addressed concerns about the right to free expression by allowing exceptions for lawful action connected to the song, such as academic and reporting activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lower court had last year rejected the government's bid for an injunction, saying it would be "of no real utility". The Department of Justice appealed against that ruling.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said professionals who came to Hong Kong through a new admission scheme have created billions of dollars of economic output.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the second day of a talent summit in Wan Chai, Sun said the government recently conducted a study to see how they are doing in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We estimate that the more than 30,000 people who had arrived here through the Top Talent Pass Scheme in 2023 can bring in about HK$34 billion of direct economic contribution to Hong Kong a year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This means they help boost our GDP by around 1.2 percent a year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said many of these professionals moved to the SAR with their young families - with two-thirds of them being under 40 - and helped rejuvenate the city’s ageing society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said a memorandum of understanding newly signed between the 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) would help expats settle in the GBA.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed the budget bill by a show of hands, with no one calling for a recorded vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan thanked legislators for their support, saying officials will do their best to implement relevant measures in a speedy manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Hong Kong is consolidating its finances in light of a budget deficit, much like many economies around the world coping with the post-pandemic environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief said the government is seeking to cut costs and find new sources of revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're confident and we also have determination to balance the books in around three years' time," he told lawmakers in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That does not include the proceeds from bond issuance. We're implementing a fiscal consolidation programme that is a common practice around the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that money received from issuing bonds will not be spent on recurrent expenditure, but on investment and infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong is in the midst of an economic transition with both opportunities and challenges, but the former outnumber the latter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the SAR needs to grasp the international situation better, and understand the country's development strategy as well as focus on meeting different challenges.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Auto-giant Toyota doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March, as strong vehicles sales and a favorable exchange rate lifted results for Japan’s top carmaker.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Toyota on Wednesday said its annual profit totaled 4.9 trillion yen, up from 2.45 trillion yen the year before, while its sales jumped 21 percent to 45 trillion yen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results exceeded Toyota’s own projection for a 4.5 trillion yen profit, as its global sales surged to 9.4 million vehicles from 8.8 million vehicles in the previous fiscal year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales of hybrids performed well, although Toyota stressed it was working hard to offer various kinds of electric vehicles, including battery EVs, plug-ins and fuel cell models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles during this fiscal year, with sales projected to grow in the US and the rest of Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toyota said it will make key investments in areas such as research on technology in coming months to sustain long-term growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It expects its net profit for the fiscal year through to March 2025 to decline nearly 28 percent to 3.57 trillion yen, with spending also covering investments in workers at suppliers and dealers it called “human capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auto industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation away from old-style gasoline engines, especially in markets like China, where EVs dominate and some analysts say automakers like Toyota may have fallen behind. (AP)

    Court reduces jail term of ear biter by 6 months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Court of Appeal deducted six months from Joe Chen's 14.5 years jail sentence. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752287_1_20240508124316.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The man who bit off part of an ear of then-district councillor Andrew Chiu in 2019 had his sentence reduced by half a year on appeal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Joe Chen was ordered to serve 14.5 years behind bars in 2022, after being found guilty of three counts of wounding with intent and a count of common assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had used a knife to stab a couple and kicked another woman on the same day before he bit Chiu outside Cityplaza in Taikoo Shing, following a protest that took place in the shopping centre in November 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down judgment on Wednesday, the Court of Appeal said Chen had paid damages of HK$3.9 million to the four people he had attacked and he had sold his flat to pay the unusually large sum of civil claim money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appeal court judges Derek Pang and Anthea Pang said High Court judge Judianna Barnes should have considered the payment as a mitigating factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said Chen had "showed his sincerity" by starting to make compensation arrangements even before the trial of this case began, which greatly reduced the suffering of the four victims during the civil claim process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the appeal court judges disagreed with the appellant's lawyers that the starting point of the sentence was too high, noting the victims were traumatised both physically and psychologically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu lost part of his left ear as a result, and the other man surnamed Wan, who sustained multiple knife injuries, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges added they did not agree that Chen had assaulted the four because he was triggered, noting he was the one who initiated a brawl with Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fact that Chen, under the influence of alcohol, lost his temper and attacked the victims after Wan swore at him, did not make him less culpable, the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also refused to accept the appellant's promise to donate his body for scientific research after death as a proof of positive good character.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that it will consider asking suppliers of non-plastic tableware to voluntarily submit quality and safety certificates, amid concerns that some products could contain carcinogenic substances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Green groups have cited overseas studies as showing that some non-plastic utensils and food containers, including some made from paper, wood and bamboo, have been found to contain the "forever chemicals" PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and fertility issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said officials are aware that there have been public concerns about the quality and safety of such products since a ban on single-use plastic items came into effect last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a question from lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, Tse said the authorities don't demand information on any PFAS content in non-plastic tableware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To provide better services to the public and the trade, the government will consider inviting suppliers to voluntarily submit relevant certificates or documents, and listing out non-plastic tableware with these certificates or documents for reference," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also cited international research organisations as saying PFAS only pose a very low risk to people's health when products only contain trace amounts of the substances.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's investment promotion agency and its office to attract strategic firms to the city on Wednesday said it had lured 45 companies in the life sciences and health technology sector to set up, or expand their businesses in the SAR since the end of 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  InvestHK said these companies, the majority of which were based on the mainland, had invested a total of HK$6.5 billion into the city, creating around 3,200 jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing, Maggie Lo, from the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, said these firms, including pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, were impressed by the level of support available in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we approach overseas companies and when we introduce our initiatives and opportunities, they were pleasantly surprised that the Hong Kong government has catered funding incentives to support every stage of their development — from basic research, clinical trials, manufacturing to sales and marketing," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added officials would continue to encourage international enterprises to expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker and a patients' rights advocate on Wednesday said the government's plan to bring forward the pre-registration hours for public dental clinics only deals with the symptoms of a queuing problem, and not the cause.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers on Tuesday that people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, instead of from midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows criticism from the Audit Commission which found patients queuing for hours overnight to be in with a chance of getting an appointment the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Tim Pang from the Society for Community Organisation said the real problem is that there aren't enough public dentists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The queue will just start earlier in the day ... because the root of the problem is the insufficient manpower of the Department of Health, leading to insufficient service availability. Therefore, no matter how the queuing arrangements are changed, the core problem is actually manpower,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pang's view, lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan noted on the same programme that there are only about 20,000 appointments available at public clinics each day, just half of the pre-pandemic level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For every 1,000 citizens, we only have 0.37 dentists... we have a significantly lower number of dentists compared to other cities,” said Chan, who chairs Legco's panel on health services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a former president of the Hong Kong Dental Association, Nelson Wong, said 108 of 300 Department of Health dentist positions are vacant at the moment.

    Hottest April on record last month: EU climate monitor

<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's climate monitor on Wednesday said last month was the hottest April on record and the 11th consecutive month of historic global heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oceans were also overheating with April marking the 13th straight monthly high for sea surface temperatures, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the C3S said in a monthly bulletin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including April, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period - 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the extremes - including months of record breaking sea surface temperatures - have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system," said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the EU's climate monitor also said the natural El Nino phenomenon which warms the Pacific Ocean and contributes to hotter weather globally "continued to weaken" in April towards more "neutral conditions". (Reuters/AFP)

 Police are investigating an accident in which a truck driver died in the early hours of Wednesday when he was thrown from his vehicle in a crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The truck rammed into railings on Tsuen Wan Road near Chai Wan Kok Cooked Food Market shortly after midnight when the driver apparently lost control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 66-year-old man fell from the vehicle and was found on Hoi Shing Road, which runs parallel with Tsuen Wan Road. He had suffered multiple injuries and was declared dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traffic was congested on Wednesday morning as the slow lane of Tsuen Wan Road, near where the accident happened, remained closed.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown and Derrick White combined for 57 points as the Boston Celtics scored a dominant 120-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers to take a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The No.1 seeds, chasing a record-breaking 18th NBA championship, were always in control against their fourth-seeded Eastern Conference rivals, holding a double-digit lead through the second half to close out an emphatic win at the TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown led the scoring for Boston with 32 points, six rebounds and two assists while the in-form White caught the eye with a 25-point haul that included seven three-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum added 18 points but had an off-night shooting-wise, making just 7-of-19 from the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donovan Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 33 points, with Evan Mobley adding 17 and Darius Garland 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown said the Celtics' defense had laid the foundation for the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It starts with defense, we wanted to set the tone on defense and we kept them under 100 [points]," Brown said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston got off to a flying start, jumping out to an early 12-2 first quarter lead before a Cleveland rally saw them edge into a 23-21 lead after Mitchell's running three-pointer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Boston responded swiftly, reclaiming the lead immediately and never allowing Cleveland to get their noses in front thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After taking a 10-point lead into half-time, Boston kept the pressure up in the second half, stretching out to a 26-point lead in the fourth quarter as they romped to a comfortable win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game two in the series takes place in Boston on Thursday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Protests by students demanding universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war spread across western Europe on Tuesday, sparking clashes and dozens of fresh arrests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's punishing assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several hundred protesters resumed a demonstration around the University of Amsterdam campus, where police the previous night were filmed baton-charging them and smashing up their tents after they refused to leave the grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests resumed on Tuesday night, demonstrators erected barriers to access routes watched over by a heavy police deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said in a statement that a total of 169 people had been arrested when officers broke up Monday night's protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had been released apart from two still in custody on suspicion of public disorder offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence had briefly erupted Monday when a small group of counter-protesters wielding flares stormed the main protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 demonstrators were also protesting Tuesday outside the library in Utrecht University and a few dozen at the Technical University of Delft, according to local news agency ANP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the eastern German city of Leipzig, the university said in a statement that 50 to 60 people occupied a lecture hall on Tuesday, waving banners that read: "University occupation against genocide".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters barricaded the lecture hall doors from the inside and erected tents in the courtyard, according to the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institution called in the police in the afternoon, and filed a criminal complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Criminal proceedings have been initiated against 13 people who were in the lecture hall on suspicion of trespassing. No arrests have been made so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, at Berlin's Free University, police cleared a demonstration after up to 80 people erected a protest camp in a courtyard of the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protesters, some of whom wore the keffiyeh scarf that has long been a symbol of the Palestinian cause, sat in front of tents and waved banners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They later tried to enter rooms and lecture halls and occupy them, according to the university, which said it then called in police to clear the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said property was damaged while classes in some buildings were suspended for the day. Berlin police said they made some arrests for incitement to hatred and trespassing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police twice intervened at the prestigious Sciences Po university to disperse about 20 students who had barricaded themselves in the main hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security forces moved in to allow other students to take their exams and made two arrests, according to Paris prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said exams proceeded without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the nearby Sorbonne university building, police late Tuesday moved to eject about 100 students who had occupied an amphitheatre and made 88 arrests, police sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Switzerland, protests spread to three universities in Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Lausanne said in a statement it "considers that there is no reason to cease these relations" with Israeli universities as protesters demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Austria, dozens of protesters have been camped on the campus of Vienna University, pitching tents and stringing up banners since late Thursday. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752255_1_20240508095326.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday after administrators who had initially adopted a permissive approach said the protest had crossed a line and caused growing concerns about safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  University president Paul Alivisatos issued a message after officers blocked access to the school's Quad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The university remains a place where dissenting voices have many avenues to express themselves, but we cannot enable an environment where the expression of some dominates and disrupts the healthy functioning of the community for the rest,” he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of protesters had gathered for at least eight days at the university until campus administrators warned them on Friday to leave the area or face removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers later picked up a barricade erected to keep protesters out of the Quad and moved it toward the demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the US — and increasingly, in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges have cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities, according to figures based on reporting by the Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As pro-Palestinian protests continue to spread, the White House said President Joe Biden welcomes peaceful protests at college commencement ceremonies where he and other administration officials will speak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest," she added. "What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden last week addressed the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest "but not a right to cause chaos" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jonas Vingegaard on Tuesday completed his first outing on a bicycle a month after a horrific crash and insisted he was hopeful of bidding for a third straight Tour de France crown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Of course I hope to be there at the start of the Tour de France," the Danish Visma-Lease a Bike rider said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't know exactly how my shape and recovery will go but I will do everything I can to get there," he added of the June 29 to July 21 race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old was hospitalised after suffering rib and collarbone fractures and sustaining lung damage in a mass crash on the Tour of the Basque Country on April 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the first time back on the bike for me, riding outside and it's really nice to be finally able to ride like normal again and finally to be able to ride on the road is really amazing," Vingegaard said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really looking forward to taking the next steps," he continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel good, it's improving day by day. I still have some things to recover from but it's going better and better." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Borussia Dortmund showed great composure to reach their third Champions League final after Mats Hummels' second-half goal earned the visitors a 1-0 victory against misfiring Paris St Germain for a deserved 2-0 aggregate win on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes into the second half to send the Germans, who won the title in 1997, into their first final in Europe's top club competition since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will meet either 14-times champions Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, who clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday after a 2-2 draw in the first leg, in the June 1 showdown at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG hit the woodwork four times but failed to find the net as Kylian Mbappe, who is widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season, was a shadow of his usual brilliant self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG, who entered the tie as favourites to reach their second final after they finished runners-up in 2020, made an aggressive start and Mbappe had their first chance in the seventh minute with a half-volley as the hosts piled on the pressure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Mbappe on the left flank and Goncalo Ramos as a lone striker, the France forward had some space out wide and the possibility to cut in and threaten the Dortmund goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors, however, were composed and held firm. Their confidence grew and they had their first opportunity through Julian Ryerson, whose shot hit the side netting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG were lucky the score on the night was level at halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luis Enrique's side stepped up a gear after the break with Warren Zaire Emery's shot hitting the outside of the post after Mbappe's attempt was deflected into his path by Ramos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dortmund were more clinical as Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes after the interval to double the German side's advantage over the two legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Mbappe attempt was deflected onto the bar before Vitinha's powerful shot also hit the woodwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG's Ousmane Dembele was a constant threat after the hour mark but, just like the rest of the team, the France forward came more into the game far too late against a side who never lost their composure and fully deserve their place in the final. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year for the fourth time on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gobert tied Hall of Fame big men Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace for the most times winning the award in league history. He received 72 first-place votes and 433 points from a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert finished tied for sixth in blocks per game [2.1] and averaged 14 points and 12.9 rebounds in 76 games, his ninth straight season averaging a double-double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Gobert's standout achievement this season was anchoring the Timberwolves' stifling defense. Minnesota ranked first in the regular season in points allowed per game [106.5] and field goal percentage allowed [45 percent] and was top five in blocks [4.5] and rebounds [41.4].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert, who is the first player in Timberwolves franchise history to win the award, won his first three Defensive Player of the Year awards with the Utah Jazz, earning the honor in 2018, 2019 and 2021. A three-time All-Star, Gobert has averaged 12,7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocks in 757 regular-season games during his 11-year career with the Jazz [2013-2022] and Timberwolves [2023-2024].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year on Monday, finished second in the voting. Wembanyama, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft, led the league in blocks per game [3.6] and also averaged 1.2 steals per game. He received 19 first-place votes and 245 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo finished third, Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis was fourth and New Orleans Pelicans forward Herbert Jones rounded out the top five. (Reuters)

    Xi Jinping arrives in Serbia after lunch with Macron

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening, after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a high altitude lunch at a childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains for the Chinese leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the next step in his European tour, Xi will hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia, where China has invested heavily to expand its economic footprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian state broadcaster RTS showed Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan descend from their Air China aeroplane to be greeted by Vucic, with a small crowd of welcomers waiting along a red carpet dressed in traditional clothing and holding flags and flowers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations," Xi said in a written statement issued by Xinhua news agency upon his arrival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to have in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, Macron pressed a message to Beijing not to support Russia's war against Ukraine and to accept fairer trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the other two countries chosen by Xi for his first trip to Europe since 2019 – Hungary is his final stop after Serbia – are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first day of Xi's state visit to France saw respectful but sometimes robust exchanges between the two presidents during a succession of talks on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi, for his part, warned the West not to "smear" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on "a great project." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished a choppy session essentially flat on Tuesday, a sideways performance that could persist until investors digest significant economic releases later in the month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The market might just be due for some pause, consolidation," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts pointed to light trading volume in a comparatively quiet period of news after last week saw major earnings reports, economic releases and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upcoming potential catalysts include US consumer price data and Walmart results, both of which are scheduled for next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones edged up 0.1 percent to 38,884.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,187, while the Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 16,332.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney dropped 9.5 percent as it reported a small quarterly loss and pointed to a moderation in travel spending expected to weigh on results at its parks division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple advanced 0.4 percent after unveiling new versions of its iPad tablets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spirit AeroSystems, a major contractor to Boeing and Airbus, fell 0.3 percent as it reported a US$616.7 million quarterly loss, reflecting a drag from lower output amid Boeing's quality control problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has also so far not reached a pricing agreement with Airbus, further weighing on financial performance. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafael Grossi held talks with Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation head Mohammad Eslami. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752216_1_20240508030843.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi on Tuesday decried "completely unsatisfactory" cooperation from Tehran after returning from Iran where he urged leaders to adopt "concrete" measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi's visit came at a time of heightened regional tensions and with his International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) criticising Iran for lack of cooperation on inspections and other outstanding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The present state is completely unsatisfactory for me. We are almost at an impasse and this needs to be changed," Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna, where the IAEA is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there was no "magic wand" to solve a "very, very complex set of issues," while he pressed the Islamic republic to "deliver very soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, for me and also I would say for the international community, there is a need to have some results sooner rather than later," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan, Grossi said he had proposed to Iranian officials that they "focus on the very concrete, very practical and tangible measures that can be implemented in order to accelerate" cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi held talks with senior Iranian officials including Atomic Energy Organisation's head Mohammad Eslami and spoke at Iran's first International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology held in Isfahan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi insisted on the need to "settle differences" on the nuclear issue while the Middle East was going through "difficult times", particularly the war between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes, political conditions pose obstacles to full-fledged cooperation" between Iran and the international community, Grossi told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi said a March 2023 agreement with Iran was "still valid" but required more "substance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement was reached during Grossi's last visit to Iran and outlined basic cooperation measures including on safeguards and monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IAEA chief said, however, that there had been a "slowdown" in the agreement's implementation, including Iran reducing the number of inspections and withdrawing the accreditation of a group of IAEA experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran suspended compliance with a landmark 2015 deal setting caps on nuclear activities after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Caitlin Clark’s first WNBA game in Los Angeles is being moved to a bigger stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Los Angeles Sparks said on Tuesday that their home game against Clark and the Indiana Fever on May 24 is being moved from Walter Pyramid on the Long Beach State campus to Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other Sparks home games – May 26 against Dallas and June 5 against Minnesota – are also moving to Crypto.com Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's where the Sparks usually play all their games and it seats 19,067 for basketball games. Walter Pyramid seats 5,000. The games were originally moved to Long Beach because of construction at Crypto.com Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women’s basketball is experiencing unprecedented viewership and attendance numbers so moving these games back to Crypto.com Arena provides us the ability to have more fans in the stands and have our players back to competing on their home floor," Sparks President Christine Monjer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sparks will still open the season on May 15 against Atlanta and play Washington on May 21 in Long Beach. (AP)

    Canadian police probe shooting near Drake's home

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police cordoned off the superstar's mansion following the shooting. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752210_1_20240508011635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tiny Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09 am (0609 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating," the inspector added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road's edge in front of the mansion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Drake, known for hits such as "God's Plan" and "Hotline Bling," was the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is currently embroiled in a feud with Kendrick Lamar, with the rappers exchanging barbed "diss tracks" that have drawn widespread attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beefs are nothing new in hip-hop, a genre long known both for its artists' boasts and their strongly worded takedowns of rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no indication that the shooting had any relation to the rap battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the bad blood between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Krawczyk said he was aware of it, but added, "it is so early in the investigation that we don't have a motive at this time, and so I cannot comment further on that." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The decision means Nottingham Forest remain on 29 points, three points above the relegation zone, with just two games left to play. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752208_1_20240508001828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest have failed in their appeal against a four-point penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules, the English top flight announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club were hit with the sanction by an independent commission in March for breaching the profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) threshold of £61 million (US$76 million) by £34.5 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest quickly indicated their intention to appeal but an independent appeal board panel has upheld the original penalty, which relates to a three-year assessment period ending with the 2022/23 season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means the 17th-placed club remain on 29 points, three points above the relegation zone, with two games left to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest had sought a reduction in the punishment because they felt the original commission should have taken the big-money sale of Brennan Johnson to Tottenham, two months after the end of the financial year ending 2023, into account as a mitigating factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also felt the original commission had made a mistake by not wholly or partially suspending the sanction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A release published on the Premier League website read: "The club argued that the independent commission committed an error in not treating its sale of a high-profile player shortly after the assessment period as a mitigating factor, and that it committed a further error in electing not to suspend some or all of the points deduction it imposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Each of these grounds was rejected by the appeal board, which found the independent commission was entitled to immediately impose the sanction it did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The four-point deduction will therefore remain in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In November, Everton were docked 10 points for breaching PSR, reduced to six on appeal, while a separate two-point deduction imposed on the club for a separate breach is under appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Goodison Park club are now clear of relegation danger following a run of good results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier League clubs are usually allowed maximum losses of £105 million over a three-year assessment period but this is reduced by £22 million per season for any seasons within the period spent in the Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, two time European champions, were promoted to the Premier League in May 2022, meaning two seasons of their three-year assessment period were as a second-tier club. (AFP)

 Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the heart of Donald Trump's hush money case, took the witness stand on Tuesday at the blockbuster trial of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The people call Stormy Daniels," prosecutor Susan Hoffinger announced as the 77-year-old Trump sat at the defence table in the Manhattan courtroom flanked by his lawyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels' testimony is expected to be a pivotal moment in the courtroom drama rocking the scandal-plagued Republican's attempt to recapture the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, 45, a long-time actor and director in the adult film industry, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was then paid to keep quiet about it on the eve of his 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, when the news could have sunk his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels and Susan Necheles, a lawyer for the former president, lodged an objection with the judge presiding over the trial to allowing her to testify about any "sexual acts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unduly prejudicial," Necheles told Judge Juan Merchan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hoffinger said Daniels' testimony would not be graphic and would "omit details that are too salacious."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors say that Trump – desperate to kill Daniels' story before it could wreck his chances in the narrow 2016 race – illegally reimbursed his fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover up the US$130,000 hush money payment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, who has become a vocal critic of his former boss, is also expected to testify at the trial as a prosecution witness. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin’s Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around them. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as “Viva, viva Palestina”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus, and officers could also be seen carrying some students away, and using pepper spray against some of the protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the Free University Berlin campus,” university president Guenter Ziegler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at US campuses. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says further integration and development with mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752193_1_20240507194419.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive, John Lee, on Tuesday called on the financial sector to enhance cooperation with the mainland, after the nation’s securities regulator introduced measures to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last month unveiled five measures to promote coordinated development between the capital markets of the mainland and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These measures included relaxing eligibility criteria for exchange-traded fund products in the Stock Connect mechanism, as well as the inclusion of real estate investment trusts for the first time. The CSRC also said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech to over 200 business leaders prior to a closed-door discussion on enhancing collaboration between the financial markets in Hong Kong and the mainland, Lee said cross-border cooperation will bring in more business opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further integration and development with the mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages and enhance the competitiveness of the mainland financial market, attracting more capital and businesses. This will drive economic development and will allow people to share in the fruits of progress," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting with business leaders, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the SAR government is still in negotiations with mainland authorities on the implementation of the CSRC's measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that these measures would allow international investors to use Hong Kong as a gateway to access mainland equity markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is the national springboard for mainland capital and investors seeking overseas opportunities, and thereby provides a very convenient and very familiar platform for overseas investors to go through Hong Kong to participate in the mainland equity market," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission’s CEO Julia Leung, meanwhile, told reporters that the measures are expected to be implemented as early as the third quarter.

    Tang Kwai-sze died of misadventure, jury rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jurors at the Coroner's Court returned a misadventure verdict for Tang Kwai-sze, who died after undergoing two liver transplants in 2017. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752183_1_20240507175609.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A liver disease patient who passed away a few months after two transplants died of misadventure, a jury at the Coroner's Court ruled on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The five-person jury returned the majority verdict following a 13-day inquest into the death of Tang Kwai-sze, with experts divided on what caused her liver failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. She died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering its verdict, the jury said Tang suffered from hepatitis B flare-up because of her taking high-dose steroids without being prescribed antiviral medication at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In guiding the jury to make its recommendations, coroner Monica Chow said jurors needed to consider whether new measures by the Hospital Authority (HA), including a guideline on antiviral prescription for hepatitis B carriers using immunosuppressive therapy, were enough to protect patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jury made five recommendations to the HA, including requiring doctors to prescribe antiviral drugs for patients on high-dose steroids for even less than seven days, subsidising hepatitis B carriers to do regular check-ups at private hospitals, educating them about precautions and symptoms, making sure doctors' clinical records were clear, and providing a reason when laboratories cancelled a test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up the hearing, the coroner told Tang's eldest daughter Michelle Wu that while her love for her mum would not fade with time, she hoped Wu could "one day fill the void left by her mother in a positive way".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner noted that Wu had volunteered to donate her liver to her mother and that showed how brave she was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All mothers in the world will tell you that [Tang] would feel comforted and proud to have such a brave, selfless, and loving daughter like you," Chow said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Christian Hospital, in response, said it respects the jury's verdict and will study its suggestions in detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had put in place measures to improve the process of prescribing medicine and the communication between medical workers and patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital again expressed condolences to Tang's family and said it would assist them where needed.

    Vladimir Putin inaugurated as Russian president

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vladimir Putin began his fifth term on Tuesday as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Already in office for nearly a quarter-century, and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putin’s new term doesn’t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin in March won a landslide victory in a tightly controlled election from which two anti-war candidates were barred on technical grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His best known opponent, Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony a month earlier, and other leading critics are in jail or have been forced to flee abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin first became Russian leader in late 1999, when he succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dutch riot police ended a pro-Palestinian demonstration at an Amsterdam university early on Tuesday, arresting some 125 people in sometimes violent clashes, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In messages posted overnight on social media X, police said they had to act to stop the event and dismantle tents that been set up by protesters, who used violence against police at the site at the University of Amsterdam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police's input was necessary to restore order. We see the footage on social media. We understand that those images may appear as intense," police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media showed demonstrators shooting fireworks at police officers but there were no immediate reports of injuries on either side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All is now quiet... police stay in the vicinity of the Roeterseiland campus," police said later on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outgoing Education minister Robbert Dijkgraaf said universities are a place for dialogue and debate and he was sad to see that police had to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student protests over the war and academic ties with Israel have begun to spread across Europe, but have remained much smaller in scale than those seen in the United States. (Reuters)

    Police aim to replace DVDs with digital image storage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Tang says it will be more efficient to upload materials to an e-platform than to store them on DVDs." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752166_1_20240507165851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security chief Chris Tang on Tuesday said the police want to build a digital platform to store images and videos with evidential or intelligence value, instead of using DVDs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official told a Legco security panel meeting that it would be more efficient and less labour-intensive to upload materials to an e-platform than to store them on DVDs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers, including Chow Man-kong from the election committee, said it is time to go digital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A friend of mine wanted to give the police a USB memory stick that contains dash camera footage to lodge a complaint on traffic matters, but they couldn't do that and were asked to submit a DVD. They were shocked," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said the system will cost HK$359 million - down from the HK$390 million previously estimated - and should be available in 2026, if Legco approves the funding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the platform would not be equipped with artificial intelligence or facial recognition capabilities, but those could be added later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agree that incorporating AI programmes to our Centralised Digital Image Platform will help us investigate cases. We will deal with it at the next stage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We just need the money, the technology is already here and it can be added [to our platform] easily. I believe it's something that has to be done in future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police also want to develop a new personnel information system, which will cost HK$142 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislature's finance committee will scrutinise the two funding requests.

 Two people were dead and 21 wounded after a man went on a stabbing spree at a hospital in Yunnan province on Tuesday, local officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "A knife attack occurred at the Chengnan Hospital in Zhenxiong County, which resulted in two deaths and 21 injuries," a statement on the county's official WeChat account said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect – a man from a nearby village – is under investigation, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded were being treated in hospital, they added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published by the state-run news site The Paper appeared to show a man pointing a knife at another man wielding a stick in a hospital lobby, as well as police officers arriving at the scene. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday arrested five men over an alleged armed robbery attempt at a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At around noon, five people entered the store at the intersection of Hankow Road and Haiphong Road carrying knives and hammers, officers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they had been tipped-off about a planned robbery and were waiting nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the operation to make the arrests, officers had drawn their guns as a warning because the robbers were holding knives and hammers. After the warning, we still used our bare hands to control them," said Superintendent Gar Kam-lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of those arrested suffered a minor injury on his face," Gar added.

    Career expo to attract mainland and foreign talent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As the city held a summit on global talent, the Hong Kong Talent Engage began a two-day career expo on Tuesday, attracting professionals from the mainland and foreign countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A job seeker from Brazil said he had worked in two mainland cities, Shanghai and Hangzhou, for five years and had just come to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the talent scheme makes it easier for people like him to work in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With this visa, I have this opportunity to come, and there's no limitations on what kinds of companies I can work for... This city is very business friendly. People have an entrepreneurial mind," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Top Talent Pass Scheme is one of several talent-admission schemes introduced by the SAR government, and even people who have not secured a job offer in Hong Kong can apply for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another job seeker from Sichuan Province said she wanted to find a job in Hong Kong because of the labour market situation on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could hardly get a [response from mainland companies]. I think I can find more opportunities here. I think I can improve my skills and have a better lifestyle here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recruitment agency said support for workers was very important in order to retain them in a long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe a lot of talent from outside of Hong Kong have got all skill sets that we lack or we're short of," said Eric Ng, chief strategy officer at the agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think all the corporations need to get ready so that they not only can attract them to come, but can retain the talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Professor David Cardwell, echoed Labour Secretary Chris Sun's views that a focus should be on attracting talent from Southeast Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the best talent, academic talent, are in Southeast Asia. The world just needs to adapt to that, to celebrate those talents, but Southeast Asia needs to make it easy for the world to do that as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CareerConnect Expo runs from Tuesday to Wednesday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.

    Israel says it is 'in control' of key Gaza crossing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel army says in 'operational control' of Gaza side of Rafah crossing. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752143_1_20240507144135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said it took "operational control" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Tuesday and that troops were scanning the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Right now we have special forces scanning the crossing... We have operational control of the area and other crossings and we have special forces scanning the area," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are only talking about the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking “operational control” of the crucial crossing for both aid and those able to flee into Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage released by the Israeli military showed a tank entering the crossing. Details of the video matched known features of the crossing and showed Israeli flags flying from tanks that seized the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was “being used for terrorist purposes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military did not provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack that killed four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom Crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military also said that ground troops and airstrikes targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt previously warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario that could threaten a 1979 peace deal with Israel that’s been a linchpin for regional security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian officials said the proposal called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides would also negotiate a “permanent calm” that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas militant group, which controls Gaza, has sought clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all hostages. (Agencies)

    'Improved dental registration to avoid queuing pain'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health secretary Lo Chung-mau said at Legco that officials are working to develop a registration and disc distribution system." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752127_1_20240507124501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Preliminary registration for dental appointments at government clinics will start four hours earlier than usual from July to prevent patients from queuing overnight and making multiple trips, according to officials, after the city's auditor called on authorities to review the arrangements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission earlier observed some patients queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment for the following day before registration starts at 12am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under current arrangements, patients who have pre-registered to see the dentist must return to the clinic in person in the morning to pick up a disc for their appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Legco's public accounts committee, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said registration would instead begin at 8pm for the following day's slots starting from July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After [preliminary] registration, patients only need to report to the clinic half an hour before the appointed time and have their identity cards checked, and then they can receive service. The improved arrangement can avoid the pain of queueing overnight and making multiple journeys to the clinics," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Thursday, registration and disc distribution at a Sai Kung government dental clinic would begin at 1pm instead of 11am, so that patients can immediately receive services that begin at 1:30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said an electronic system for appointment registration at dental clinics was in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patients no longer have to physically get a disc. The online platform will provide information of the number of remaining quota discs of the 11 clinics. We have started the work of developing the system, which will be launched shortly," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials attributed a shortage of dental staff to difficulties in increasing the annual quota of appointment slots, with Director of Health Ronald Lam pointing to a shortfall of 108 practitioners, which accounted for 30 percent of the total manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said authorities decided to allocate to more resources to serving the underprivileged by raising the number of slots from 20,000 to 60,000 next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government's efforts to attract talent to the city will focus on professionals from Southeast Asia and Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun’s remark came after the government approved 180,000 talent importation scheme applications, with 120,000 people having already arrived in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Global Talent Summit, Sun said most of the applicants were from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the labour minister said the government is committed to welcoming talent from all over the world, with a focus on Southeast Asia and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very sure once we have let them know all the growth prospects, all the very exciting opportunities here in Hong Kong, a lot of the talents in Southeast Asia as well as in Europe, they will be thinking about Hong Kong and they will really give Hong Kong a good shot," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the government expects around 7,000 people to attend the two-day summit at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping on Tuesday said the central government fully supports Hong Kong in attracting international entrepreneurs and talent to develop their ambitions in the SAR, as well as the integration of the Greater Bay Area into global innovation networks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Global Talent Summit in Wan Chai, Wang said the nation has the largest talent resources pool in the world, with over 80 million technical professionals and over 200 million skilled workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of people who have received higher education exceeds 240 million, while China is ranked first in the world for the number of research and development personnel and patent applications, the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said these things provide a solid foundation for the nation to support Hong Kong in building a “new highland” of international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The central government attaches great importance to Hong Kong's role in building human resources, and fully supports Hong Kong in conducting wider and closer exchanges and cooperation with other parts of the world to attract aspiring entrepreneurs to Hong Kong to develop their ambitions”, said Wang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We support building a high-level talent base in the Greater Bay Area, attracting global high-level innovation talent, businesses, as well as research institutions to the Greater Bay Area, as well as promoting the region to be integrated into the global innovation networks,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to China’s transition towards high-quality development, the minister also said the nation will concentrate on industrial modernisation and cultivate more high-quality, innovative professionals to develop “new quality productive forces”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation will also push forward creating mechanisms and platforms to introduce global talent into the Greater Bay Area, which will provide new impetus for Hong Kong’s prosperity and integration into national development, she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong is the place to be for global talent, in part because the SAR has long been one of Asia's most liveable cities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a government-organised summit on talent, the CE said Hong Kong is the only city where "the global and China advantages" come together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that other institutional strengths include prime business prospects because of the One Country, Two Systems principle, a low tax system as well as the free flow of information, capital, goods and people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said language is never a problem because English and Chinese are both official languages in the SAR, and Hong Kong will get even more multilingual as it thrives as a cultural hub where East meets West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that 40 percent of the territory is earmarked as country parks with a UNESCO geopark, endless hiking trails and stunning beaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, you don't just get world-class work opportunities, you get a satisfying life, too," Lee said in an opening speech at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, choosing to relocate to Hong Kong on your own or with your loved ones is a big decision. But I'm here to tell you, that this is the place where you can work hard, play hard and enjoy hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the central government's recent move to relax visa rules for Shanghai and Beijing businesspeople to come to Hong Kong will promote professional exchanges and reinforce the SAR's role as the country's international talent hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also thanked senior officials from Beijing, particularly Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping, as well as those from Guangdong and Macau, for attending the summit and sharing their ideas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people over the alleged abduction of a woman in Tsim Sha Tsui on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers were notified at around noon that two masked men dressed in black had attacked a woman and bundled her into a vehicle at the junction of Ichang Street and Hankow Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman, 47, was later found unharmed in a different vehicle near Heng On Estate in Ma On Shan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inspector Chan Kwan-to on Tuesday said officers arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of various offences, including unlawful detention and driving without a licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said officers believe the alleged kidnappers and victim already knew each other and that they were involved in a financial dispute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's thought the woman was first taken to a flat in Tsing Yi and was released following discussions over a HK$100,000 debt, the inspector said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Brunson produced a scintillating fourth quarter performance as the New York Knicks edged past the Indiana Pacers 121-117 in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series opener on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Knicks talisman Brunson finished with 43 points, six rebounds and six assists to give New York the early advantage in their best-of-seven conference semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was his ice-cool performance down the stretch that swept New York to victory in front of 19,812 fans at an electric Madison Square Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks guard rattled in 21 points in the fourth quarter to complete his fourth straight playoff game with 40 points or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donte DiVincenzo backed Brunson with 25 points while Josh Hart weighed in with a monster performance that included 24 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists, three steals and a block.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner led the Pacers scorers with 23 points while Pascal Siakam added 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's what you love about Jalen," Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said after the win. "I could go on and on about him, but the thing I love about him is he's all about the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson's fourth quarter rally settled a pulsating contest that saw neither side gain more than a single-digit advantage across four quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers opened up a nine-point lead early in the fourth quarter before the Knicks came roaring back to reel it in, edging into a four-point lead at 113-109 after Brunson's step-back jumper with 2min 42sec remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DiVincenzo also came up with a huge clutch play with 40 seconds remaining, nailing a 28-foot three-pointer to put New York 118-115 ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana got back to within one at 118-117 but a harsh offensive foul called against Turner on DiVincenzo with 13 seconds remaining proved decisive, ceding possession back to New York and allowing the hosts to close out the win. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian woman, accused of killing her in-laws with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington, pleaded not guilty to a raft of murder charges on Tuesday, court officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erin Patterson faces three counts of murder for allegedly dishing up a poisonous meal in July 2023 that killed her parents-in-law, as well as the wife of a local pastor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 49-year-old, who is also accused of attempting to kill her estranged husband four times, indicated to a Melbourne court that she would fight the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court officials said the case, which has captured headlines around the world, would now be fast-tracked for trial at the Supreme Court of Victoria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patterson allegedly served the beef Wellington to her estranged parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, as well as local Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, 69, and his wife Heather Wilkinson, 66.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have previously suggested the meal she served included lethal death cap mushrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the lunch guests -- Don and Gail Patterson, and Heather Wilkinson -- died in the days following the meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ian Wilkinson recovered after spending nearly two months in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Detectives said husband Simon Patterson also "became ill after meals" served by his estranged wife on four separate occasions in 2021 and 2022 -- and have charged Erin Patterson with his attempted murder. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday thanked President Xi Jinping for backing his idea of a truce in all conflicts including Ukraine during the Paris Olympics this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I thank you for showing your desire during our talks to ask all parties to have an Olympic truce," Macron said at a joint press conference, adding that such a truce for "all theatres" of war could help achieve lasting peace in the conflicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Ukraine, President Xi said China supports the convening of an international peace conference on the crisis at an appropriate time. He said the conference should be recognized by both Russia and Ukraine, with equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also said he would welcome President Macron to visit China again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi arrived in Paris on Sunday for a two-day visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a meeting with Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, Xinhua news agency reported that Xi said the two countries should always define China-Europe relations as a comprehensive strategic partnership, and remove various distractions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron is set take Xi to the Pyrenees on Tuesday, a mountainous region dear to the French president as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi will then leave France for Serbia before completing his European tour in Hungary. (Xinhua and AFP)

    Boeing Starliner spaceship launch postponed
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The postponement was announced about two hours before blast-off. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752092_1_20240507090426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically postponed around two hours before launch after a new safety issue was identified, officials said Monday, in a fresh blow to the US aerospace giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already strapped in their seats preparing for lift-off when the call for a "scrub" came, in order to give engineers time to investigate anomalous readings from an oxygen relief valve on the second stage of the rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Standing down on tonight's attempt to launch," tweeted NASA chief Bill Nelson. "As I've said before, @NASA's first priority is safety. We go when we're ready."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission comes at a challenging time for Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs its commercial aviation division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test flight, which has already experienced years of delays, is a crucial step for the space agency, which has long sought a second commercial partner to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a nearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the Space Shuttle program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clad in Boeing's bright blue spacesuits, the astronauts were helped out of the spaceship then boarded a van to leave the launch tower at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, returning to their quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next possible launch window is on Tuesday, then Friday and Saturday, assuming the issue is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will be propelled into orbit by an Atlas V rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture. Once in space, the crew will take the helm, piloting the craft manually to test its capabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts, both Navy-trained pilots and space program veterans, have each been to the ISS twice, traveling once on a shuttle and then aboard a Russian Soyuz vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule with a cabin about as roomy as an SUV, is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS for a week-long stay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams and Wilmore will conduct a series of tests to verify the capsule's functionality before returning to Earth for a parachute-assisted landing in the western United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by numerous setbacks in the Starliner programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, software defects meant the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS. "Ground intervention prevented loss of vehicle," said NASA in the aftermath, chiding Boeing for inadequate safety checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022 in a non-crewed launch. But other problems that came to light -- including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin that needed to be removed -- caused further delays to the crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA use on regular ISS missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club four years ago, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of US$4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules under its Commercial Crew Program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marked a shift in NASA's approach from owning space flight hardware to instead paying private partners for their services as the primary customer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took a swipe at Boeing, gloating that his company "finished 4 years sooner" despite receiving a smaller contract. He attributed Boeing's delay to "too many non-technical managers" in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to taxi humans to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the orbital lab is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used for future private space stations that several companies are developing. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama was voted NBA Rookie of the Year in a unanimous decision on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French star received all 99 first-place votes from a media panel voting on the award, joining Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard and Karl-Anthony Towns as unanimous winners of the award. Oklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren was a strong runner-up by receiving 98 of a possible 99 second-place votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama lived up to the hype surrounding him as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft. He averaged 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals in 71 games. His 254 total blocks led the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama led all NBA rookies in points, rebounds and blocks along with double-doubles [43] and triple-doubles [two]. He became the youngest player in league history to post a 5x5 when he had 27 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, five blocks and five steals against the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama became the first player in NBA history to tally 1,500 points, 700 rebounds, 250 assists, 250 blocked shots and 100 3-pointers in a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the first player from France to win the award and third member of the Spurs, joining franchise legends David Robinson and Tim Duncan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlotte's Brandon Miller [86 total points, including one second-place vote], Miami's Jaime Jaquez Jr. [10 points], Golden State's Brandin Podziemski [four points] and Dallas' Dereck Lively II [one point] also received votes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Michael Olise scored a brace of goals as Crystal Palace completed a league double over Manchester United for the first time in their history with a thumping 4-0 victory at Selhurst Park on Monday that will add to the pressure on Erik ten Hag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A makeshift United defence that included Casemiro at centre-back was easily picked apart by Palace on several occasions as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell were also on the scoresheet in the impressive win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, two points behind Newcastle United in sixth, with their hopes of European football next season fading fast. Palace are still in 14th with 43 points from 36 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United had several injury absentees and were without Bruno Fernandes, the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career he has missed a match with injury, but the ease with which they were beaten will be a huge concern for everyone at the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A big disappointment. We just had an off-day and we weren't in it," midfielder Christian Eriksen said. "It is what it is. We can't really change the injury things. We have to do what we can on the pitch to change it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today it didn't matter who we played. Everyone could have done better. We tried to do what we could but we were not good enough. We'll take the blame as players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first time in the Premier League era United have lost 13 games in a season and the scoreline might have been worse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home side took the lead inside 12 minutes as Olise collected a throw and evaded a limp challenge from Casemiro. With no United player attempting to close him down, he was able to unleash a low shot from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 2-0 five minutes before the break as Mateta breezed past United defender Jonny Evans and thrashed the ball into the net for a ninth goal in 11 games since the arrival of Glasner in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The striker had scored 11 goals in his previous 80 games for Palace before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United’s makeshift defence was struggling to contain the movement of their hosts and when Diogo Dalot failed to deal with a ball to the back post, Mitchell had a tap-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olise’s second goal added more salt to the wound and it could have been worse for the visitors as Odsonne Edouard saw his shot come back off the woodwork late on. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks advanced on Monday, extending a rally on hopes for possible Federal Reserve interest rate cuts soon after weaker US jobs data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US stocks were in positive territory the whole session as analysts pointed to Friday's jobs report showing weaker than expected employment growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A note from Charles Schwab characterised the report as "perfect" in terms of being in "not too hot and not too cold territory," while adding that "it's just one set of numbers and there's a risk that the market may overreact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 38,852 up 0.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.0 percent to 5,180, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.2 percent to 16,349.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices have risen the last three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Paramount Global gained 3.1 percent following a New York Times report that it entered into talks with a bidding group led by Sony Pictures and Apollo after negotiations between Paramount and Skydance didn't produce a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyson Foods slid 5.7 percent as it reported slightly lower revenues and projected flat sales in the upcoming quarter. Executives said inflation was pinching low-income consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spirit Airlines sank 10 percent after reporting a US$142.6 million quarterly loss. The carrier pointed to a "challenging" competitive environment due to "elevated capacity" in key markets. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham manager David Moyes will leave "by mutual consent" when his contract expires at the end of the season, the Premier League club said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement of Moyes's impending exit came just a day after the Hammers suffered an embarrassing 5-0 loss to London rivals Chelsea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires," said a club statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's announcement came amid media speculation that former Real Madrid, Wolves and Spain manager Julen Loptegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes, in his second spell as West Ham manager, after the end of the current campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moyes said: "I have enjoyed four-and-a-half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I joined West Ham for a second time, the club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 61-year-old Scot, a former manager of Everton, added: "After leading the club (West Ham) to safety, we guided the team to finishes of sixth and seventh in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June – the club's first major trophy in 43 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four-and-a-half years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham joint chairman David Sullivan told the club's website: "On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia announced on Monday that its troops stationed near Ukraine would run nuclear weapons drills and threatened to strike UK military targets outside the embattled country, citing what it said was an escalation in Western sabre-rattling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry announced the drills and also said Russian forces had captured two villages in eastern Ukraine, where outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian troops have been struggling to hold their positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in the border region of Belgorod meanwhile said that Ukrainian aerial attacks had left at least seven people dead and wounded over 30, including several children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin, who ordered the nuclear drills, has upped his nuclear rhetoric since ordering his army into Ukraine in 2022, warning in February there was a "real" risk of nuclear war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry gave no date for the exercises, but said they would involve the air force, navy and troops stationed near Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said they were aimed at ensuring Russian territorial integrity in the face of Western "threats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin specified that the exercises were a response to statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and British officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has in recent days hit out at Macron for telling The Economist magazine he was "not ruling anything out" in the West's response to the conflict in Ukraine, including sending troops to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also blasted UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for saying Kyiv has the right to strike targets inside Russia. (AFP)

    Biden speaks with Netanyahu as Rafah invasion looms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden held urgent talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday after Israel defied repeated US warnings and told Palestinians to evacuate part of the southern Gaza city of Rafah ahead of an offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came as Biden mounts a diplomatic offensive to get ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas back on track, with Jordan's King Abdullah II due at the White House for lunch on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden told Netanyahu in April that invading Rafah would be a "mistake," and Washington has said it does not support an offensive without a credible plan to protect some 1.2 million civilians sheltering there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House confirmed that "President Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Netanyahu," and said it would release a readout with details of the call soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden did not respond to shouted questions and walked straight to the Oval Office from his helicopter, Marine One, after arriving back at the White House from a weekend at his family home in Wilmington, Delaware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the US National Security Council, announcing earlier that the call would take place, said "we have made our views clear on a major ground invasion of Rafah to the Israeli government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to believe that a hostage deal is the best way to preserve the lives of the hostages, and avoid an invasion of Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those talks are ongoing now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is under growing domestic pressure about the war in Gaza in an election year, with pro-Palestinian protests roiling US university campuses in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York's prestigious Columbia University, which has been at the heart of the protests, said on Monday it had canceled the main graduation ceremony for students next week. (AFP)

    Political veteran set to become Scotland's next leader

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752059_1_20240506235527.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scottish political veteran John Swinney on Monday was named head of the pro-independence SNP party, leaving him poised to become Scotland's new leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swinney, 60, said on X, formerly Twitter, he was "deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP" after Humza Yousaf resigned last week after little more than a year as Scottish leader and head of the Scottish National Party (SNP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters later that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence his key policy idea was the eradication of child poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a curse and under my leadership I want to eradicate it in Scotland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On independence he said the party would "get our act together" to win back the votes of supporters who may have turned away from the party in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Humza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swinney, an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, will now face a vote in the Scottish parliament later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape. (AFP)

    Judge threatens Trump with jail

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial sanctioned him on Monday for violating his gag order again. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752053_1_20240506222820.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal trial on Monday said he would hold the former president in contempt of court for a 10th time for violating a gag order, and warned he would consider jailing him for any further violations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Justice Juan Merchan said the nine fines he had imposed so far did not seem to be deterring Trump from violating the gag order, which prohibits him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan said he considered jail time “truly the last resort” for many reasons, including the disruption to the trial, the political implications of jailing a leading presidential candidate ahead of an election and the extraordinary security challenges of incarcerating an ex-president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said Trump’s “continued, willful” violations of the gag order amounted to a “direct attack on the rule of law.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I do not want to impose a jail sanction and have done everything I can to avoid doing so. But I will if necessary,” Merchan said from the bench in the absence of the jury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York law allows fines of up to US$1,000 or jail time of up to 30 days for violating a court-imposed gag order. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The five-day Golden Week holiday ending on May 5 saw some 766,000 mainland visitor arrivals to Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752047_1_20240506213637.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More mainland tourists came to Hong Kong during the Golden Week holiday compared to the previous year, the government revealed on Monday, saying the number of inbound arrivals from across the border met expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration said the city saw about 766,000 mainland visitor arrivals over the five-day break ending on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On average, Hong Kong recorded some 153,000 inbound trips from the mainland each day, about 22 percent more than last year's Golden Week holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the Golden Week was affected by the rain most of the time, the number of mainland visitors reached around 760,000, matching our initial estimate and bringing Hong Kong's economy with more than HK$2 billion consumption returns," said Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 570 tour groups from the mainland came to Hong Kong during the five-day period, while May 2 recorded the highest number of inbound arrivals with 192,000 people arriving in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials earlier estimated about 800,000 mainland visitor arrivals for the holiday period.

    Fire services body reports potential data leak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Fire Services Department says there's no evidence that data subject to a potential leak has been released. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752042_1_20240506205340.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department (FSD) on Monday said the personal information of thousands of people, including its staff and individuals who filed tree collapse reports during a super typhoon, could have been leaked after the right to access the data was altered without permission.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it reassured the public there was no evidence that any such data had actually been released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it discovered personal data potentially being exposed on one of its IT systems last Friday, which involved the surnames and telephone numbers of some 480 people who had reported tree collapses when Super Typhoon Saola hit Hong Kong in September last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 5,000 fire services staff were also affected and had their names, phone numbers, ranks and numbers, and postings subject to the potential leak, with some even having their incomplete identity card numbers possibly exposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The FSD believes that the incident happened when the outsourced contractor handled the data migration procedure. During the process, the access right of the data was found altered without authorisation, posing a potential risk of data leakage," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department has demanded the outsourced contractor to immediately suspend the system and all of its contract jobs, while withdrawing its access right to the system to prevent data being exposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also apologised and notified those affected through text messages or phone calls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest incident came after a string of data breaches at major public bodies, such as the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Companies Registry, with a lawmaker calling for the heads of government departments responsible for such leaks to be held accountable for the blunders.
