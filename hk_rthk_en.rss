<div class="itemFullText">
 Growth in China's exports slowed last month while imports returned to the black, customs data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Exports were up 7 percent in July year on year after posting an 8.6 percent increase the month before, the strongest rise in 15 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's figure was the weakest since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of the year taken together, exports rose 6.7 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, rose at a robust 7.2 percent last month, compared with a 2.3 percent contraction in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's imports growth was the fastest in three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports climbed 5.4 percent in the January-July period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus narrowed to US$84.65 billion in July from US$99.05 billion in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, the trade surplus expanded by 7.9 percent year on year to US$518 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns remained for the world's second-largest economy after second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent from 5.3 percent in the January-March period, keeping alive calls for policymakers to roll out more support to reach the government's full-year growth target of around 5 percent.

    Govt urged to prevent misuse of healthcare vouchers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A lawmaker says the government should act as a gatekeeper to prevent potential misuse of the elderly healthcare voucher. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765112_1_20240807113008.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Wednesday urged the government to ensure proper use of public funds as the city's healthcare voucher scheme for the elderly is further expanded to include more mainland medical institutions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong residents aged 65 and above receive HK$2,000 vouchers each year to spend on private healthcare services. From next Wednesday, these vouchers will be accepted at seven facilities in the Greater Bay Area, up from four at present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca Chan, chairwoman of Legco's health services panel, said during an RTHK programme that the government should act as a gatekeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There shouldn't be any possibility of reselling the vouchers or using them for other purposes, such as just buying [medical] products.... The government needs to act as a gatekeeper, perhaps through inspections. They should also look at how to deal with reports of illegal use," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Siu, who manages a mainland service provider covered by the voucher scheme, highlighted the growing trend of Hong Kong residents, especially the elderly, seeking medical services across the border. About one in five of his clients are from Hong Kong, a number he expects to increase after the scheme is further expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the expansion could help ease the strain on Hong Kong's medical system, adding that his firm plans to hire more Cantonese-speaking staff to meet the growing demand.

    Rower thanks family support for strong finish in Paris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rower Chiu Hin-chun, a two-time SAR Olympian who made history with his performance at the Paris Games, said he wants to thank his family for supporting his career over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu was ranked 20th overall in Paris, the best result for himself and a male Hong Kong rower at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished fourth in his heat in the preliminary round at the Paris Games, and had to go through the repechage to advance to the next stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the heat, I keep asking myself if anything I can squeeze more to not get caught by the Hungarian athlete. And after that, I told myself I already gave my 100 percent in the heat so there's no regrets,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking on five Olympic races in just a week, Chiu said the biggest challenge was to recover both mentally and physically in a short period of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have to think [about] how to recover, what else I have to eat so I can recover faster. In the middle of the race, I feel very tired and [have] to adjust my [mentality] to prepare for the next race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a lightweight rower competing in the open category, he admitted it’s not easy to take on Europeans who are larger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with a bright smile, the 29-year-old said family support kept him going until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially like this time, they come to Paris and they have to walk through like the 2km courses from the start to the finish to the spectator stage to watch my race, and then go back to the start again, and to take the bus and go back to the hotel,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Normally people have their family trip [elsewhere], and our family trip is watching my race. So it is really special for us,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Formerly a windsurfer, Chiu found his place on the flat water because of the satisfaction it brought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In rowing, we have a quote, it’s ‘mileage makes champions’. So when I changed to rowing, I [was] very satisfied with my performance and also the achievements can keep pushing me to the other level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who won a World Cup gold medal in Switzerland just before Paris, will fly to Canada next for the World Rowing Championships from August 18 to 25.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong market opened stronger on Wednesday, taking its cue from Wall Street, which partially rebounded from a sell-off in the previous session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index was up 37.44 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,684.78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, investors returned to the market after soothing comments by Federal Reserve officials eased US recession worries, with the S&P and the Nasdaq both gaining more than one percent, and the Dow rising 0.8 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland's Kellie Harrington has retained her Olympic title, beating China's top seed Yang Wenlu in a much-anticipated gold medal bout.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The women's 60kg showdown took place in front of a raucous crowd inside Court Phillipe Chatrier at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harrington got off to a good start, taking the first round when four of five judges ruled in her favour. Yang tried to respond but lost round two 4-1 on the cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the verge of victory, Harrington turned defensive in the final round, looking to run down the clock instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her tactic worked, as she won by a 4-1 split decision to become the first Irishwoman to win back-to-back Olympic golds. The 34-year-old amateur boxer was in tears as her victory was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the ring, Algeria's Imane Khelif remains on course for a gold medal after ousting Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand on 5-0 unanimous decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khelif, who was disqualified by the now-suspended International Boxing Association last year after failing gender tests, will take on China's Yang Liu in the women's 66kg final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang advanced after beating Chinese Taipei's Chen Nien-chin by a split decision of 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot Wu Yu also progressed to the women's 50kg gold medal bout, after the top seed defeated Kazakhstan's Nazym Kyzaibay.

    US stocks rebound after three days of losses

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765070_1_20240807051212.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday after three straight days of losses, with analysts pointing to bargain hunting and US bond markets bouncing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gains in New York also followed a quieter day in most overseas stock markets and came as Caterpillar and Uber reported solid earnings, lifting shares of both companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful that we'll get some stability back," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that there could still be "a little more downside risks to the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.8 percent at 38,997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,240, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 1.0 percent to 16,366.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices fell more than 2.5 percent on Monday in a move seen as a reflection of worries about a US recession following Friday's disappointing jobs data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market watchers have also pointed to ripple effects from Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and have led to liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei, which slumped 12.4 percent on Monday, jumped 10.2 percent on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reversal in the US equity market came as US Treasury bond yields climbed and as a closely-watched volatility index retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Caterpillar gained 3.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as strong pricing offset the hit from lower revenues. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Netherlands proved once again they only have themselves to beat, shaving fractions off their own record time not once, but twice on Tuesday evening in Paris to retain their track cycling team sprint gold medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trio of Jeffrey Hoogland, Harrie Lavreysen and Roy van den Berg edged Great Britain's Jack Carlin, Ed Lowe and Hamish Turnbull by more than eight-tenths of a second to clinch victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch threw down the gauntlet on their opponents after setting a record-breaking time of 41.191 seconds in the heat. They also owned the previous best of 41.225 seconds achieved in February 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That fresh record stood for less than an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They eclipsed the 41-second barrier with a gold-winning time of 40.949 seconds in the final. Australia denied France a podium finish in the bronze medal race earlier, while China finished seventh.

   China's teenage sensation Quan Hongchan comfortably defended her diving gold in the 10 metre platform, fending off teammate Chen Yuxi who took silver while Kim Mi-rae of North Korea rounded up the podium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That marked a second gold medal for 17-year-old Quan in Paris. China remains on track for a clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Games, clinching five so far, with three more up for grabs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Cole Hocker delivered one of the all-time Olympic shocks when he won the 1,500 metres gold with a stunning finish to blast past world champion Josh Kerr as defending champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen faded to fourth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The race had been billed as a showdown between Ingebrigtsen and Kerr and the Norwegian set a hot pace as he led coming into the last 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briton Kerr, just as he did in last year’s world championships, surged past him and looked set for victory, only for Hocker to find a way through on the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His winning time of three minutes 27.65 was an Olympic record and a massive personal best by more than three seconds. Kerr posted a national record 3:27.79 and Yared Nuguse took bronze for the US in another huge pb of 3:27.80.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ingebrigtsen finished fourth in a time faster than his Olympic record set in Tokyo, but the double world champion over 5,000m has another shot at a medal as he goes in the heats over that distance on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Gabby Thomas finally claimed the global title she has promised for so long when she delivered a dominant performance to take Olympic 200 metres gold, denying silver medallist Julien Alfred a sprint double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, 27, took bronze in Tokyo and silver in last year’s world championships, but she was in control throughout the final, coming home in 21.83 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alfred, who claimed Saint Lucia’s first Olympic medal when she won the 100m on Saturday, was a clear second in 22.08, with Brittany Brown taking bronze for the US in 20.20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's Zhao Jie claimed bronze in the women's hammer throw, behind Camryn Rogers, who won gold for Canada, and Annette Echikunwoke of the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Miltiadis Tentoglou retained the gold medal in the men's long jump. Jamaican Wayne Pinnock took silver and Italy's Mattia Furlani claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bahrain's Winfred Yavi won the women's 3,000 metres steeplechase. Uganda's Peruth Chemutai took silver and Kenya's Faith Cherotich claimed bronze. (Reuters)

 China's hopes of a first-ever men's wrestling gold were dashed early on Wednesday as Cao Liguo was beaten by Japan's Kenichiro Fumita in the 60kg Greco-Roman final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile there was history in the 130kg Greco-Roman final, when Cuban wrestler Mijain Lopez became the first athlete to win five consecutive individual gold medals in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita won by a cumulative score of 4-1 over two periods, and led from start to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao requested a challenge out of desperation as time expired, but the judge ruled the result would stand and the 25-year-old Guangxi native had to settle for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zholaman Sharshenbekov of Kazakhstan and North Korean Ri Se-ung earlier took bronze in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has only two Olympic wrestling golds, with the last one coming in 2008 when Wang Jiao clinched the women's 72kg freestyle. Since then the team has racked up three silvers and four bronzes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita, meanwhile, becomes the first Japanese entrant to win a Greco-Roman gold since 1984.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 130kg final, Lopez, who turns 42 in two weeks' time, defeated Chile's Yasmani Acosta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his victory, Lopez broke a tie for four successive individual Olympic golds he shared with Carl Lewis (athletics/long jump), Michael Phelps (swimming/200m medley), Katie Ledecky (swimming/800m freestyle), Al Oerter (athletics/discus), Paul Elvstrom (sailing) and Kaori Icho (wrestling).

    Harris picks 'real deal' governor Walz as running mate

    <![CDATA[<img alt="U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks next to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz during a visit to the St. Paul Health Center, an abortion clinic in St. Paul, Minnesota, March 14, 2024. File Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765062_1_20240807021812.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris said on Tuesday she was "proud" to tap Tim Walz as her running mate, opting for the Minnesota governor with blue-collar credentials as the partner most likely to boost her historic White House bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walz had been on a vice-presidential shortlist with a string of other Democratic figures seen as broadening Harris's appeal as she sprints into the contest against Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming to make history as the first woman US president, Harris, already a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, has little time before Election Day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud to announce that I've asked Tim Walz to be my running mate," she posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden quickly expressed support for his deputy's "great decision" to choose Walz, saying the duo "will be a powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket and help win over working-class, white, male voters, a demographic that propelled Trump to victory in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner, decades of military experience and a rural perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dismisses the "nonsense" of Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance, and he is also a gun-owner who tweets about hunting, goes ice-fishing and rides rollercoasters with his daughter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The onetime teacher and school sports coach flipped a Republican district in 2006 to win a seat in the House of Representatives in a state seen as light years from the coastal elites of California, Harris's home turf, or the East Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Walz will appeal to the left for championing cannabis legalization, worker protections, abortion rights, and tighter firearm restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's campaign branded the Minnesotan as a "dangerously liberal extremist" seeking to impose California values on the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic grandee Nancy Pelosi swatted such criticism aside, telling MSNBC that Walz "is right down the middle. He's a heartland of America Democrat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz earned enthusiastic endorsements from Democratic liberals as well as centrists like Senator Joe Manchin, who called him "the real deal." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's teenage sensation Quan Hongchan comfortably defended her diving gold in the 10 metre platform, fending off teammate Chen Yuxi who took silver while Kim Mi-rae of North Korea rounded up the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That marked a second gold medal for 17-year-old Quan in Paris, having clinched the 10 metre synchronised platform title with Chen earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China remains on track for a clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Games, clinching five so far, with three more up for grabs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performing last out of the 12 finalists, Quan showed composure and led after each of the five rounds for a wire-to-wire victory. She couldn't replicate her Olympic record of 466.2 points set in Tokyo, finishing with 425.6 this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By comparison, Chen accumulated 420.7 points, and 372.1 for Kim. The North Korean clinched her country's first Olympic medal in an individual diving event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The youngest Olympian in Paris, 11-year-old Zheng Haohao from China, had a strong first run in the women's park skateboarding preliminaries on Tuesday, but that wasn't enough for her to advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng had an opening score of 63.19 with a clean run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she fell in her second and third runs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each competitor had three runs, and their ranking is determined by the highest score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The score of 63.19 placed Zheng 18th out of 22 athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian teenage skateboarding sensation Arisa Trew won the Olympic gold, edging out Japan's Cocona Hiraki in silver and Britain's injured Sky Brown in bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trew, 14, in her trademark pink helmet, nailed a high-risk and high-speed final round to leap to the top of the rankings, bringing some of the crowd to their feet at a sun-drenched Place de la Concorde stadium. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday urged Hongkongers planning to travel to the United Kingdom, or those who are already there, to be careful given the ongoing protests and riots there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber outbound travel alert – the lowest in a three-tier warning system – is currently in effect for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means there are signs of threat and people visiting should "monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation and asked any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or reach out to the Chinese Embassy in the UK.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's volleyball team on Tuesday crashed out of the Paris Olympics, suffering a 3-2 defeat to Turkey in a nail-biting quarter-final clash at South Paris Arena 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China, who are three-time Olympic champions, claimed the first set 25-23 before dropping the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took the fourth set to force a tie-breaker, but fell short 15-12 in the deciding fifth set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Melissa Teresa Vargas scored 42 points to lead the Turkish women to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was tied 11-all in the fifth set before a smash of Vargas and a spiking error from Wu Mengjie of China pushed Turkey up 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gong Xiangyu had a smash to pull China within 13-12, but another kill of Vargas and a smart play of Elif Sahin – who replaced injured starting setter Cansu Ozbay in the last three sets – sealed the victory for the Turkish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Vargas played a great game," said China head coach Cai Bin. "We tried our best to stop her, but could not do that well enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey next face Serbia or Italy in the semi-finals. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    EOC calls for better public breastfeeding facilities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Tuesday called for improvements to public facilities for breastfeeding.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The body said a survey of 1,000 breastfeeding mothers found 81 percent were unhappy with the facilities available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Complaints included an insufficient number of babycare and lactation rooms, and small sizes and poor hygiene conditions when it comes to some of those that are available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The conditions of these facilities will directly affect whether women choose to breastfeed or express milk in public places, and may even become barriers to breastfeeding," said EOC Executive Director Ferrick Chu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 90 percent of the survey respondents said they thought shopping centres should provide more breastfeeding or expressing facilities, while over 80 percent thought commercial and government premises should improve the hygiene standards of their facilities, the EOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission said the government should ensure an even distribution of breastfeeding facilities across different areas of the city and provide incentives for premises to establish and maintain high-quality facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Breastfeeding is not just a mother's responsibility, it also affects the growth and development of the next generation. All sectors of society have a duty to create a favourable environment for breastfeeding mothers," said EOC Chairwoman Linda Lam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Tuesday called on Hong Kong's business sector to make proactive efforts to understand, respond and embrace changes, during a session studying a letter by President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a recent reply letter to Hong Kong entrepreneurs with family ties to Ningbo, Xi urged them to leverage their strengths and contribute to Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, was quoted as saying that society, especially the business sector, should take the president's words as a guide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, who heads Beijing's liaison office in the SAR, noted that the letter was not only an encouragement for the entrepreneurs, but also expressed Xi's high hopes for the entire business community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR should act as the protagonist, actively participating in the torrent of further comprehensively deepening reforms. It should not be a bystander, but be someone who's involved," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong should fully grasp areas that should be maintained and remain unchanged, areas that should be changed, and areas where it should take the lead in making a change."

 Citybus on Tuesday announced an across-the-board pay rise of 3.6 per cent for all employees.

  The bus company said that while the market environment remains challenging and it's facing strong inflationary pressures, it considers its workforce to be a very valuable asset.

  <br/>

    China will launch satellites to rival Starlink: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carries Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764990_1_20240806155559.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A state-owned enterprise is close to launching the first batch of satellites for a megaconstellation designed to rival US company Space X's Starlink's near-global internet network, a mainland newspaper has reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A successful launch would mark an important step in Beijing's strategic goal of creating its own version of Starlink, a growing commercial broadband constellation that has about 5,500 satellites in space and is used by consumers, companies and government agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The launch, led by Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), will take place at Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre, one of the nation's main satellite and missile launch centres, located in the northern province of Shanxi, the China Securities Journal reported on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The launch is part of SSST's "Thousand Sails Constellation" plan, also known as the "G60 Starlink Plan", which began last year and aims to deploy more than 15,000 low Earth orbit (Leo) satellites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo satellites usually operate at altitudes of 300km to 2,000km from the Earth's surface and have the advantage of being cheaper and providing more efficient transmission than satellites at higher orbits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starlink, operated by billionaire Elon Musk, has tens of thousands of users in the United States so far and plans to add tens of thousands more satellites to its system, which is the largest of its kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SSST's "Thousand Sails constellation" is one of three "ten-thousand star constellation" plans China is hoping will allow it to close the gap with SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SSST's plan is to launch 108 satellites this year, 648 satellites by the end of 2025, provide a "global network coverage" by 2027, and get to 15,000 satellites deployed before 2030. (Reuters)

 Sources say members of the Chinese team for the Paris Olympics will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong later this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The delegation is expected to be in the SAR from August 29 to 31, although it is unclear how many athletes will take part in the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland Olympic stars visited Hong Kong in 2021 after the Tokyo Games, taking part in sports demonstrations and performances during their stay.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislator and Chinese medicine professor Chan Wing-kwong on Tuesday welcomed reports that the voluntary health insurance scheme will be extended to cover services at the city's first Chinese medicine hospital, saying it would be a significant step by the government to further recognise traditional Chinese medicine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine-storey hospital in Tseung Kwan O is due to open next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Chan said both Chinese and Western medicine hospitals should be treated equally by insurance companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a hospital - whether it specialises in Chinese medicine or Western medicine - the cost of services is essentially the same. From hospital beds to nursing care and other essential services, the cost is comparable. Therefore, insurance companies should expand their coverage to include these healthcare services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, who is the general manager of China Taiping Insurance Company, said the industry needs to know more about what kind of medical services the new hospital will provide and how much it will charge before deciding on insurance premiums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By then, we will have more data to consider how to calculate premiums in the future if we want to extend the voluntary health insurance to cover traditional Chinese medicine services at the hospital," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An opening ceremony was held on Tuesday for Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery, with Chief Executive John Lee calling for a wide range of visitors to the attraction.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gallery, at the Hong Kong Museum of History, will open to the public on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said he hopes various groups of people will visit, including groups from primary and secondary schools and youth organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the crucial role of such visits in effectively promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE stressed that safeguarding national security is a responsibility of the SAR government. He reiterated the government's commitment to accurately and fully upholding the One Country, Two Systems principle, while safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Safeguarding national security is always a work in progress. There is no completion. Given the ever-changing international situation, it is necessary to maintain a sense of crisis," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, described the gallery as a place to help citizens better understand national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The opening of the National Security Exhibition Gallery will further consolidate the consensus that security brings prosperity, and cultivate the grounds for safeguarding national security," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR star swimmer Siobhan Haughey has returned to Hong Kong after winning two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters at the airport that she needs to recharge her batteries before returning to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to take a break first, and then I'll start training afterwards, because my next competition will be the World Cup in mid-October, so a short break just to process everything that happened and enjoy some down time," Haughey said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what she thinks about being the Hong Kong athlete with the most number of Olympic medals, Haughey said she is honoured to represent the city and bring glory to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I enjoyed this Olympics so much and I have done my best in the competition. The process is much more important than the outcome, I have no regrets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said the atmosphere in Paris was much better than the Covid-era Tokyo 2021 Olympics as there was an audience in the arena this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents and fans can watch my competitions inside the venue... and there are people from Hong Kong everywhere. It feels like we are celebrating the Olympics together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swimmer said she has no exact plans on how to spend her HK$3 million prize money, but wishes to do something to thank her team for supporting her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey also called for more resources to be allocated to swimming, to enable more young people to reach higher levels in the sport.

 Another world record was broken at the Stade de France as Olympians battled it out on the track and field at the Olympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There was also more gold for China in men's shooting and gymnastics while American superstar Simone Biles saw her bid for more Olympic glory stumble on the balance beam and floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China leads the medals table with 21 golds with the United States close behind in second place with 20. Australia rise to third in the table with 13 golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's what happened on Day 10:

   <br/>
   Two rare errors proved costly for Simone Biles, as the US gymnastics superstar failed to add to her golden haul at the Paris Olympics on Day 10.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Widely considered one of the greatest gymnasts in history, Biles was bidding to add to her Paris collection of three golds in the balance beam and floor finals at the Bercy Arena.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she slipped off the beam while walking backwards in her routine, the unusual error gifting gold to Italy's Alice D'Amato.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the floor exercise final, two landing hiccups sent her into silver behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, she leaves Paris with three golds and one silver, with a career total of 11 Olympic medals.

    China's Zou Jingyuan produced a commanding performance on the parallel bars to successfully defend his Olympic title at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Zou, only the second ever back-to-back Olympic champion on the apparatus, was joined on the podium by Ukraine's Illia Kovtun in silver, with Japan's Shinnosuke Oka claiming bronze.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oka would later go on to add the horizontal bar gold to his team and all-around titles he won earlier in Paris.

     The 34-year-old world-record holder made 32 hits in the final to secure China's fifth shooting gold in Paris.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Reigning world champion An, who has held the number one ranking for the past year, beat her sixth-seeded opponent 21-13, 21-16 at a lively La Chapelle Arena.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the men's singles final, Denmark's Viktor Axelsen retained his Olympic badminton title, demolishing Thailand's world champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn to claim gold.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's table tennis team of Doo Hoi-kem, Lee Ho-ching and Zhu Chengzhu was unable to advance to the next stage of the women's team competition, losing 3-2 to Sweden in the round of 16.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first three matches between the teams went the distance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s Filippa Bergand and Christina Kallberg won the first two games in the first match 11-9, 11-5. The SAR pair of Doo and Lee made a strong comeback and won the next three games 11-9, 11-4 and 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhu Chengzhu took on Sweden’s Linda Bergstrom in the second match. After a tight back and forth, Bergstrom ultimately came out victorious to bring an overall tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo played against Kallberg in the third match and won the first two games 11-5, before losing the next three to the Sweden player 8-11 and 3-11 and 10-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fourth match, Zhu dominated the three games 11-8, 11-4 and 11-6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee lost 5-11, 6-11, and 10-12 in the final and decisive match against Bergstrom, bringing their Olympic journey to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo took responsibility for the loss, saying she let Kallberg back in the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel I share a bigger responsibility for the defeat because I dropped the third match, it's what led to a loss for the team," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, said she felt the team had no regrets because they had done their best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added she had played Bergstrom before and had a tough time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the first two games against her [this time], it seems I couldn't really find good ways to make a breakthrough," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, when I found a way in the third game, it was too late. My in-game adjustments weren't bold enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR women’s table tennis team took home bronze in the Tokyo Games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered a bruising rout on Monday, extending a pullback attributed to economic unease and fallout from recent lurches in overseas financial markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the Dow Jones losing 2.6 percent, or more than 1,000 points, to finish at 38,703.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 3.0 percent to end at 5,186, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent to 16,200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses followed down days last Thursday and Friday on the heels of poor US employment data and a negative survey from manufacturers that sparked worries about a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seizing on that point, some market watchers have called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – perhaps even in an emergency meeting – after the central bank kept rates unchanged last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But market watchers are also focusing on the ripple effects of Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and slammed Japan's Nikkei equity market, which dove 12.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an abrupt move in a market that has a lot of tentacles," Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said of the Japan currency shift, which is believed to have led to speedy liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan believes the Japan currency movements are much more a factor in the turbulence than recession fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survey results of services companies by the Institute for Supply Management showed stronger than expected growth, boosting US Treasury bond yields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts at High Frequency Economics called the report "a refreshingly stronger-than-expected outcome" that helps to counter the gloom from last week's economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether it will turn around the US equity sell-off is to be determined, of course," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet dropped 4.6 percent after a US judge sided with antitrust officials who had alleged that the company operated a monopoly with its dominant search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also had a bad day, losing 4.8 percent on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had cut its stake in the tech giant. (AFP)

 Kenya's Beatrice Chebet won the gold medal in the women's Olympic 5,000 metres in a time of 14 minutes, 28.56 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands' Sifan Hassan claimed silver and Italian Nadia Battocletti took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chebet produced a thrilling sprint finish to claim the first medal for her country at the Paris Olympics.

  In the women's 800 metres final, Britain's Keely Hodgkinson delivered a command performance to win the gold medal and claim her first global title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's something that I've dreamed of so much it hasn't actually sunk in yet," Hodgkinson told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The crowd was just absolutely incredible, it felt like a home Olympics for me. It just made the moment super special and I'm super happy," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham signed Germany striker Niclas Fuellkrug from Borussia Dortmund on Monday for a reported fee of £27.5 million (US$35 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug scored 16 goals in his sole season at Dortmund to help the German giants reach last season's Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old also netted twice despite starting all five matches on the bench as Germany reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A battering ram of a centre-forward, Fuellkrug is a huge fan favourite in his homeland, with many calling for him to start ahead of Arsenal's Kai Havertz at the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the Premier League is the best league in the world, and for me it is the right time to move over to England and play for a big club like West Ham," said Fuellkrug in a club statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham have been one of the busier Premier League sides during a quiet transfer window so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Crysencio Summerville and Luis Guilherme and defender Max Kilman have also joined the 2023 Europa Conference League winners for Julen Lopetegui's first season in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are delighted to have signed Niclas," said West Ham technical director Tim Steidten, who previously worked with Fuellkrug at Werder Bremen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have worked with him previously and I know what he will bring to us in terms of his physical and finishing qualities, as well as his character and mentality." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Somalis joined a demonstration on Monday against the jihadist group Al-Shabaab at the site of a deadly beachfront attack in the capital Mogadishu last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A suicide bomber and gunmen attacked the popular Lido Beach on Friday evening, killing 37 people and wounding scores more, in one of the deadliest strikes in the East African country in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We came here to Lido Beach to show we can't be intimidated," said one of the protesters, Abdisalam Ahmed Abdullahi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mogadishu people are not afraid of Kharijite enemy," he said, using a government term for the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants who have carried out numerous attacks in the predominantly Muslim country for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survivors of Friday's assault described how following an explosion, gunmen stormed onto the beach intending to "kill everyone they could," with graphic video shared online showing bloodied bodies on the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Shabaab has been waging a bloody insurgency against Somalia's fragile federal government for more than 17 years and has previously targeted the Lido beach area, which is popular with business people and government members as well as ordinary Somalis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Somali people in general, and those in Mogadishu particularly, need to unite in fighting against the enemy," said Livestock Minister Hassan Hussein, one of several government officials who joined the rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described Al-Shabaab militants as "bedbugs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amina Ibrahim Halane said she joined the rally to show sympathy for the victims of Friday's attack, saying they were simply "innocent men... enjoying their city." (AFP)

    HK's Nicholas Halliday ends maiden Olympic run

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China sailor Nicholas Halliday has been eliminated from men’s dinghy competition, with two races cancelled on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The last races were scrapped due to a lack of wind in Marseille, meaning Halliday had no chance to make the top 10 to enter the medal race on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR sailor ranked 24th out of 43 participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday was on 136 net points, compared with 99 for Ireland’s Finn Lynch in 10th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday said it was a shame the races got cancelled because he was feeling good to go, but overall he was satisfied with his Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, but it was really exciting," he told RTHK in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I'm satisfied. I mean I gave it my all, I left no stones unturned, so I'm happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday added he's already setting his sights on qualifying for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.

    Debby blows US$1mn in cocaine onto Florida beach

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Debby landed in Florida on Monday bringing high winds, pouring rain – and 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than US$1 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Debby, which hit the state's northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, washed the trove of drugs ashore along Florida's southernmost tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane Debby blew 25 packages of cocaine onto a beach in the Florida Keys," US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The load of drugs, which Briggs reported was valued at more than US$1 million, was discovered by a good Samaritan who contacted the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July of 2023, the mayor of Tampa, Florida similarly discovered 31.7 kilogrammes of cocaine that had been washed ashore in the Florida Keys, while enjoying a vacation day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to bringing cocaine, Debby has killed one person, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, and could produce life-threatening storm surges as well as catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Keys, a string of islands stretching off the state's southern tip, are located in close proximity to a number of Caribbean countries that serve as a transit hub for cocaine being trafficked from South America to Europe and North America, including into Florida. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark's Viktor Axelsen successfully defended his Olympic badminton title on Monday, demolishing Thailand's world champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn in the men's singles final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Backed by a vocal crowd of Danish fans at La Chapelle Arena, the second-seeded Axelsen battled past his eighth-seeded opponent 21-11, 21-11 in 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitidsarn's silver was Thailand's first-ever Olympic medal in badminton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia took bronze after beating India's Lakshya Sen 13-21, 21-16, 21-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lanky Dane became the first man to retain his Olympic men's singles title since Chinese legend Lin Dan, who won in 2008 and 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Axelsen brushed aside suggestions that he had reached the same level as the Chinese player, calling him the greatest of all time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me he (Lin) is the GOAT and I'm just very happy and proud to be, in Olympic terms, on the same level," Axlesen said of Lin, who was also present in the arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in my eyes, he stands as the best ever." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We received 80 bodies inside 15 bags, with more than four martyrs in each bag, each wrapped in a single shroud", said Civil Defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Suleiman said Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not know if they are martyrs (killed in Gaza) or prisoners from (Israel's) jails," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video released by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, men in hazmat suits could be seen inspecting the corpses, before unloading them from the shipping container they had arrived in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The footage then showed the bodies being laid in a line for burial in a mass grave dug in the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were later buried at the Turkish cemetery, near Khan Younis, the main city in the southern part of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salwa Karaz, a displaced woman from Gaza City in the north, said that she had gone to the Turkish cemetery hoping to find her 32-year-old son Marwan, who went missing in January. He left behind an eight-month-old son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we learned that 80 bodies had been handed over, we came to search in hopes of finding him among them", said the 59-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of now, we have not learned anything," she lamented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will try to identify him through his clothes. He was wearing brown pants, a navy blue shirt, a black jacket, and beige boots."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She last saw him leaving on his bicycle from their shelter in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Hamas said Israel's delivery of bodies without identities "exacerbates the suffering of the families of martyrs and the missing, who seek to know the fate of their abducted children or to bury their martyrs in a dignified manner."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Hamas government sources said Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were then buried in Gaza, the sources added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to Gaza's health ministry which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rebeca Andrade of Brazil got the better of American Simone Biles in the women’s floor exercise final on Monday, bringing the artistic gymnastics competition to an end at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andrade brought flair to her routine at the Bercy Arena, as she executed every move with precision to earn a difficulty score of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.266, to bring the total to 14.166.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the Brazilian's first gold medal in Paris after she won two silvers in the all-around and vault and a bronze in the team event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who was the floor champion in Rio in 2016, brought the highest difficulty of 6.900 to the competition with skills named after her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed her routine with incredible height and technique, but she stepped out of bounds which led to a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles ended up with a final score of 14.133 to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old finished the Paris Games with three golds and one silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles’ teammate Jordan Chiles was the final performer of the competition, and was fifth after her routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her score was bumped to a 13.766 after an inquiry, beating out Ana Barbosu of Romania for the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Ou Yushan finished eighth of the nine competitors with a score of 13.000.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shinnosuke Oka of Japan has captured his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics, winning the horizontal bar final on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka executed a clean routine to come away with a score of 14.533.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a difficulty of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.633.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia’s Angel Barajas also had a score of 14.533 but had to settle for silver because Oka had a higher execution mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both were competing in their first Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the fourth medal in Paris for Oka, who has already won gold in the team event and the all-around as well as a bronze in the parallel bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Zhang Boheng and Tang Chia-hung of Chinese Taipei shared the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang, also a first-time Olympian, completed his routine with clean technique and execution, but the 24-year-old wasn’t able to stick his dismount, falling forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a 13.966 with a difficulty of 6.500 and execution of 7.466.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had a small fall in the middle of his routine, but the rest of his technique was able to pull him to a 13.966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The horizontal bar final saw its share of errors and falls, including China’s Su Weide who was unable to land on his feet, leaning forward to catch himself with his hands. He finished in fifth place.

    Bangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman takes charge

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters march towards Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's palace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764866_1_20240805212642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman spent nearly four decades rising to the top of the military and said on Monday he was "taking full responsibility" after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bedecked with medal ribbons on his green fatigues and wearing a four-star general's cap, Waker said 76-year-old Hasina had quit and that the army would "form an interim government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I give you my word that all the injustices will be addressed," the career infantry officer said in a broadcast to the nation on state television, although it was not immediately clear if he would head the new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed – it is time to stop the violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mild-looking, bespectacled officer was appointed as chief of army staff, the military's top job, only in June. Hasina had trusted him because he was a distant relative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The experienced soldier has served as a UN peacekeeper as well as in Hasina's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His father-in-law was army chief during the first of Hasina's five terms as prime minister from 1996-2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a caretaker government for two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina then ruled Bangladesh from 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protesters stormed Hasina's palace on Monday and she fled by helicopter, Waker said he would speak to the president to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed that the new authorities would "prosecute all murders" following weeks of deadly protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army was deployed on the streets to crush the protests last month but shifted on Sunday and in several instances allowed demonstrations to go on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker said he had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members, although not with Hasina's Awami League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of us together will forge a beautiful future," he said. "If we work together, we can achieve a favourable outcome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh Military Academy graduate, who served two tours as a UN peacekeeper in Angola and Liberia, called for the weeks of protests to stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 300 people were killed in the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the situation gets better, there is no need for emergency," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker appealed to the university students who first launched protests in early July to support the army. The protests were initially against government hiring rules but spiralled into demands for Hasina to leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the task of the students is to keep calm and help us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker, who Bangladeshi media say is aged 57 or 58, also received officer training in Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Married with two daughters, he holds master's degrees in defence studies from Bangladesh's National University and King's College London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was commissioned in 1985, also serving as an instructor at the army's college for infantry and tactics and at Bangladesh's institute for peace support operations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Simone Biles fell out of medal contention in the women’s artistic gymnastics balance beam final on Monday at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Italy’s Alice D’Amato finished a solid routine to earn a score 14.366, with a difficulty score of 5.800 and an execution score of 8.566, for her first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Zhou Yaqin earned silver thanks to a strong finish. She started off the competition with a clean routine, adding many connecting elements to boost her difficulty score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 18-year-old gymnast lost her balance at one point, but she was able to stay on the beam to earn her a 14.100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhou finished a close second behind Biles at the World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Italian gymnast, Manila Esposito, completed the podium in Paris with a score of 14.000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles slipped and fell off the apparatus at the end of her acrobatic series, unable to complete the last flip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to finish her routine and stick the landing, and the 27-year-old was tied for fourth.

 China’s Zou Jingyuan retained his title in the men’s artistic gymnastics parallel bars on Monday at the Paris Olympics, while compatriot Zhang Boheng missed out of the podium after being edged out by Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The reigning champion executed his routine with precision, hitting each handstand and hold to earn him a difficulty score of 6.900 and an execution score of 9.300, for an overall 16.200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun won silver with the highest difficulty of the competition of 7.000, to earn a 15.500 total.

  China’s Zhang had been in third for much of the competition, but was ultimately overtaken by Oka, who earned 15.300.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were a total of eight competitors at this event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Zou's third medal in Paris and China's second gold in gymnastics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's An Se-young consolidated her status as the top player in women's badminton by winning the Olympic title on Monday, beating China's He Bingjiao in the final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Reigning world champion An, who has held the number one ranking for the past year, beat her sixth-seeded opponent 21-13, 21-16 at a lively La Chapelle Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old An is the dominant force in women's badminton and won eight titles on the world tour last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She became South Korea's first Olympic women's singles champion since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He, who lost the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, progressed to the final when her opponent Carolina Marin retired from their semi-final after collapsing with a knee injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was looking to win China's third badminton gold of the Paris Games, following successes in mixed and women's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made An work for every point in a fast and furious first game, until the South Korean began to ease ahead towards the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She closed the first game out when He smashed a return into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An quickly gained the upper hand in the second game and her march towards the title began to look inevitable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He slowed her progress with an incredible smash return midway through the game but An would not be stopped and she sealed the win on her third match point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My golden age isn't here yet because I'm still young," the South Korean gold medallist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will still have more experiences and I will be able to play even better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said she was happy to take home the silver medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think from the moment I qualified for the Olympics it’s been a hard journey, since at the time I was only able to come here because I won by a slight margin by the end. So I treasure this opportunity a lot, and I am very happy that I can come all the way from preliminaries to the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska Tunjung won the bronze by default after Marin's semi-final retirement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bank of China (Hong Kong) said the outlook for the SAR and mainland economies is positive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said the local economy is seeing a stable recovery, with strong inbound tourist figures and low unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also said retail sales remained weak and housing prices could drop "by a small margin" this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the world's second-largest economy, the bank believes it will reach its 5 percent growth target for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still believe that the growth rate in China will eventually translate to the growth rate in China's enterprise sector, I mean all the corporates in China," said Ding Meng, senior economist of Bank of China (Hong Kong).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we are anticipating the improvement of the profits prospect in China-related investments, so we are kind of positive for the stock market here in Hong Kong and also in mainland China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank also said it expects the US Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September or December this year.

 The observatory on Monday said it had recorded the city's hottest day so far this year, with the mercury hitting 35.4 degrees Celsius at its headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This topped the year's previous high of 34.8 degrees on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parts of the territory were even hotter on Monday afternoon, with 37.3 degrees recorded in Happy Valley, 37.7 degrees in Yuen Long Park and 38.9 degrees in Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientific Officer Sin Chuen-keung warned that further extremely high temperatures are expected in the coming week.

 The MTR Corporation on Monday announced that services between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay will come to a close about two hours earlier than usual on October 26, to allow for track diversion work for the Tung Chung Line Extension.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train from Sunny Bay to Tung Chung will depart at 11.07pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The railway company said it will arrange free shuttle buses between the two stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services on the rest of the line will run as normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The construction of the Tung Chung Line Extension project commenced last year, with plans to add a new Tung Chung East Station between Tung Chung Station and Sunny Bay Station.

 Veteran sharpshooter Li Yuehong claimed his maiden gold medal in his third Olympic appearance with victory in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old world-record holder made 32 hits in the final to secure China's fifth shooting gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's Cho Yeong-jae won silver, scoring 25, while Li's compatriot Wang Xinjie took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible experience for me – all of my personal hard work and the effort my team put into this game have finally paid off," Li said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a victory not only for myself, but rather for the whole team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li won bronze at both the Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's shooting pair of Jiang Yiting and Lyu Jianlin took home bronze in the mixed skeet event, with Lyu not missing a single shot in their 44-43 win against India.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government adviser says most people won't need to get a Covid booster shot again. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764819_1_20240805161830.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government adviser on Covid suggested on Monday that the cost-effectiveness and coverage of Covid booster vaccinations should be assessed in the long term as infections become milder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases currently recommends a booster shot every six months for high-risk groups such as the over-50s and those with underlying health conditions. They can receive the booster free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's chairman, Professor Lau Yu-lung, said there has been a slight increase in Covid cases recently, but this is not a cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From a public health perspective, we really need some kind of a study to assess the cost-effectiveness... it might not be necessary to administer as in the past, the whole scale of approach for a lot of people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Recently, because of the upsurge of all the monitoring indices, as well as you can just learn from your friends and families who got infected, most of them are really very mild... Indeed every successive infection will be milder than the previous infection until you won't even notice it."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says hot weather led to increased electricity demand. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764812_1_20240805153704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday announced a mid-year net profit of HK$5.95 billion, a near 18 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company said Hong Kong’s accelerated economic recovery, along with hotter weather, led to increased electricity demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Australian and Indian business also improved, offsetting the impact of reduced electricity generation at its nuclear power plants on the mainland due to scheduled maintenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP also pointed to various renewable energy projects on the mainland, saying they will be the key drivers for its profit in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s revenue rose to HK$44.09 billion, an almost 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.63 per share, matching the first interim dividend of the year and unchanged from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have always been generating revenue and dividends for the benefit of our shareholders. And we adopt a policy to have a reliable and consistent dividend with steady growth supported by sustainable business development,” said CLP's chief executive officer TK Chiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we will continue to grow the business and if the condition approves, of course, we will try to adjust our dividend. But at the end of the day, the dividend will be approved by the board.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiang also said any further reduction in prices for consumers in the remainder of the year will depend on the international fuel market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because of the continued easing of the energy prices globally, we saw tariff reduction. From January up to August, the tariff for CLP's customers in Hong Kong saw a reduction of about 2 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the remaining part of the year, it will really depend on the international fuel price trend. If the fuel price continues to follow the current trend, there could be an opportunity for further adjustments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about progress in reviewing its power management system following several voltage dips this year, Chiang said the company is working on solutions to minimise the impact such incidents have on customers.

    Nikkei suffers record points loss

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, driven by last week's plunge in global stock markets, economic concerns and worries investments funded by a cheap yen were being unwound.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei share average shed a staggering 12.4 percent as Friday's dismal US jobs data heightened worries of a possible recession, and as the yen rallied to seven-month highs versus the US dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27 percent drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the close on Monday, the index closed at 31,458.42 and had wiped out 113 trillion yen (US$792.32 billion) of that peak market value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks," said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after a soft jobs report stoked fears of an oncoming recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the US economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike," said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen was last up 2.5 percent at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14 percent in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The banking sector slumped 17 percent to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader Topix fell 12.2 percent to 2,227.15. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested 119 people in a two-week anti-triad operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they shut down five alleged vice establishments, seven suspected gambling dens, as well as a facility they believe was being used to manufacture illegal drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Inspector Thomas Anthony Lo said the force believes it also busted a syndicate that had scammed people selling luxury goods on social media by making purchases with fake banknotes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group would claim to help the victims inspect and authenticate the items they were selling. At the same time, the alleged scammers would use transparent, plastic bags that contained a pile of cash to district the victims. The victims would also be instructed to go to another room to give their signatures," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this period, the syndicate would take the opportunity to take away the victims' valuables, leave the scene and never return."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the victims, who lost HK$2 million between them, later realised that only the banknotes on the top and bottom of the stacks were real and the rest were counterfeit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Passengers who were overcharged by the operator of four New Territories minibus routes can get a refund from Monday, transport authorities announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department earlier revealed that the green-top minibus routes operated by Fully Mint Limited – 501A, 501C, 501K and 501S – had been charging passengers more than the approved fares for over two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that from May 19 to July 26, the operator set fares between HK$0.3 and HK$1 higher than the permitted amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A department spokesperson on Monday said passengers affected can get the excess fare amounts back either in cash or via electronic payment methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As beneficiaries under the Government Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities were not affected by the overcharging incident, refund is not needed. The [green minibus] operator will reimburse the government for the overpaid subsidies under the scheme," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers who paid by Octopus can claim a refund via the mobile app or at an Octopus Service Point, while people who paid in cash can get their refund from the minibus operator at Wo Mun Street PLB Terminus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alipay and AlipayHK, for their part, said the overcharged fares have been refunded directly to users affected.

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK leader Keir Starmer warned far-right protesters on Sunday they would "regret" participating in England's worst rioting in 13 years, as disturbances linked to the murder of three children earlier this week flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about the mass stabbing last Monday in the northwestern English seaside town of Southport has hit multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is a major challenge for Starmer, elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves," Starmer said in a TV address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was "no justification" for what he called "far-right thuggery", he added, promising to bring the perpetrators "to justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the northeastern English city of Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters squared up to riot police carrying shields. Some threw bricks, cans and pots at officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters there seized a camera from an AFP crew and broke it. The journalists were not injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh disturbances came after police said more than 150 people had been arrested since Saturday following skirmishes at far-right rallies in Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police -- injuring several officers -- and looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since summer 2011, when widespread rioting followed the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late Sunday, Staffordshire police said another hotel known to have sheltered asylum seekers was targeted near Birmingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large group of individuals" have been "throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police" at the hotel in the town of Tamworth, with one officer injured, said the statement. (AFP)

    Sprinter Felix Diu eyes new HK 100m record after Paris

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764679_2_20240804164357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu, fresh from his Olympic debut in Paris, said he now wants to set a new SAR record in the men’s 100m.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Diu finished fourth in his heat at the Paris Games in 10.62 seconds, and said he was thrilled to have competed with the world's top runners at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s quite awesome, because we've seen a lot of world-class athletes here and it's a great experience to see such a huge venue here and a lot of people watching me compete in the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Olympic debutant was taking part despite a leg injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu entered the Paris Games through a wild card. Olympic qualification for the 100m sprint was 10 seconds, and his personal best is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprinter said his next goal is to break the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100m specialist noted that for the first time, the Olympic track is in purple, instead of red or blue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's made with recycled shells produced by the fishing industry, as part of efforts to promote sustainability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the track at the Stade de France is not completely rubber on the bottom but is filled with air cells of a geometric shape, to boost athletes’ performances and prevent injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the purple track is really making the athletes really comfortable to combat in and also the material they use is very bouncing, so it's really helpful for our performance,” Diu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu started training in secondary school because he enjoyed the excitement of sprinting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I just quite enjoy the process of training and competition. It brings me satisfaction and excitement,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And with the Los Angeles Games four years away, he said he will continue to improve his game and work hard as a full-time athlete.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris, a pavilion has been set up on the sidelines of the Olympic Games to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between China and France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China House – featuring Chinese-style galleries, exhibits and ancient Olympic sports – was launched by the Chinese Olympic Committee two days before the opening of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's deputy secretary general Yu Jianyong said the China House "is a bridge to promote friendly exchanges between China and foreign countries and promote the mutual construction of civilisations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A team of volunteers maintains its operation, some of whom are from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was a dream come true to be part of the Games and experience the Olympic hype in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raheema, a Chinese-Pakistani studying in the SAR, said the experience allowed her to step out of her comfort zone and meet people from all over the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As someone that is really introverted, it's really hard for me to be able to communicate with others,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics is about bringing different people with different backgrounds and different stories all together, being able to communicate with everyone I can broaden my horizons and also understand more about different people.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another volunteer, Annie, said she was inspired after seeing the earliest forms of Olympic sports at the China House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We feel like we can learn a lot more about the whole historical part and at the same time to really experience the whole Olympic atmosphere in person right in France this year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Annie added that she also found it inspirational to speak with athletes from the national team there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the visitors at the China House was a diving gold medallist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, He Chong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he thinks people should just enjoy the Games and not put too much pressure on athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we should look at these [athletes] with a more rational perspective. They are here to join the world's top sports event and chase their dreams. We should not focus on how many gold medals they can win for China."

 World records broken, defending champions prevailing, and one of the closest finishes to the men's 100 metre dash in Olympic history, were among the highlights of Day 9 in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the Games now in their second week, the US heads the medals table with 19 golds while China are second with the same amount of golds but fewer medals overall than the Americans. Hosts France are third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look at what happened:

   China de-throned the United States in the men's 4x100m medley relay, winning gold in a time of 3 minutes, 27.46 seconds, edging the US into silver by 0.55 seconds while France claimed the bronze.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, the Americans closed out the meet at the top of the swimming medals table thanks to world record efforts from Bobby Finke in the men's 1,500m freestyle and the US women in the 4x100m medley relay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom won the other gold of the night in the women's 50m freestyle.

    Team China dominated the podium with a gold and silver in the men’s rings final at Bercy Arena in Paris.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Liu Yang, who is the reigning Olympic champion in this event, earned a score of 15.300 with a difficulty of 6.400 and an executive score of 8.900 to land him the gold.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    His Chinese counterpart Zou Jingyuan, who is dubbed the king of parallel bars, came behind with a score of 15.23.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also in gymnastics, Algeria's Kaylia Nemour became the first African to win an Olympic medal in the sport when she secured the gold on the uneven bars while the Philippines celebrated their second gold of the competition when Carlos Edriel Yulo won the men's vault, a day after winning the individual floor title.
