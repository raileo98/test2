<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A goal by Youri Tielemans after 73 seconds and a late one for Kevin De Bruyne gave Belgium a 2-0 win over Romania in an incredible, action-packed game on Saturday that set up a final round showdown with all four teams in Group E on three points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was a Euro 2024 Saturday night special played in an astonishing atmosphere in Cologne, with the only mystery being how there were only two goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It meant that, for the first time in European Championship history, all four teams in a group are on equal points after two rounds, following Ukraine's 2-1 win over Slovakia on Friday. All outcomes are now available on the final night on Wednesday when Belgium play Ukraine and Slovakia play Romania, where four points could be enough to top the group but could also see a team eliminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania and Belgium have the advantage with a plus-one goal difference. Slovakia are on zero and Ukraine on -2 - with those goal differences the deciding factor should both games end level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were very relieved we won the game, it was very important to get three points," said Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco. "Romania gave us a bit more space that Slovakia but with the quality and quantity of our chances it would have been good if we could have scored more early on - four or five goals tonight would have been possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium, still somehow ranked third in the world by FIFA, were unrecognisable from the sluggish side shocked by Slovakia in their opening game, pouring forward and full of energy from the first whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It paid dividends immediately as Romelu Lukaku held up the ball with his back to goal before rolling it into the path of Tielemans, who drilled home a crisp, low shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later Romania went close with a header by Radu Dragusin that Koen Casteels saved well, but it was a brief respite as Belgium ran the first-half show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dodi Lukebakio’s fierce shot was well saved by Florin Nita after a trademark carving run by man of the match De Bruyne, while Lukebakio and Amadou Onana both blazed over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed only a matter of time before they scored again, but Romania weathered the storm and, knowing how they struck so devastatingly on the counter to beat Ukraine, did not panic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their fans certainly stayed behind them, helping create an amazing atmosphere as noise rained down from all four stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waves of Belgian attacks continued though, as Jeremy Doku fizzed a cross inches from Lukaku’s head, De Bruyne curled just past a post then had another shot smothered by Nita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukaku thought he had got the second after an hour, slotting home confidently from a De Bruyne through ball, only for VAR to rule it out for offside – five days after he had two goals chalked off against Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incredible end-to-end action continued with Dennis Man clean through for Romania only to shoot wastefully straight at Casteels and then, incredibly, it was the Belgian keeper who set up the second 10 minutes from time with a Sunday league, route one goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He launched a goal kick that evaded everyone and the ever-switched on De Bruyne seized on it to tuck the ball home for what could prove a priceless goal should the calculators be needed to split the teams next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania, of course, are also still in the hunt to reach the knockout stage for only the second time, having failed to even qualify for the last six World Cups following their golden era of the 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a great start to the tournament, now let's see how we deal with difficulty. We need solidarity and unity because we are still first in the group," their coach Edward Iordanescu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a most complicated group - a third goal would have been really bad for us." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili hailed his team's "historic" first ever point after a thrilling 1-1 draw against the Czech Republic at Euro 2024 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Georges Mikautadze struck from the penalty spot for the Euros debutants in the first half in Hamburg but Patrik Schick levelled for the Czechs after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valencia stopper Mamardashvili made 11 saves in a brilliant display and was named player of the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an opening defeat by Turkey, the draw means Georgia will likely have to beat one of the tournament favourites Portugal in their third match to progress from Group F.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am quite happy and satisfied just for being here... our first point is a historic moment," Mamardashvili told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia might even have won the game at the death against the run of play, but after being sent in on goal, substitute Saba Lobjanidze hammered over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Atalanta United winger's team-mates and Georgia coach Willy Sagnol went to him at the end to try and raise his spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the three-and-a-half years I've been coaching Georgia, we've done a lot of very positive things on the pitch, but it's also a massive and very important human experience for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagnol said his squad had mixed feelings at full-time after claiming their first point but seeing two more slip between their fingers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know if the point is deserved, but for everything we've done together, I think it's deserved." he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech coach Ivan Hasek said it was a scary moment for his side, who had dominated the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last seconds it was three-on-one, we were really scared, and we survived it and we have to go on," said the coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't want to go home yet, we will fight until the very end against Turkey so we can get into the knock-out rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech goalscorer Schick limped off with an apparent calf problem in the second half and Hasek said further tests were needed, although he was not positive the Bayer Leverkusen striker would be ready for the final group match on Wednesday. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A French gendarme stands guard at the courthouse, where eleven independentists face court for their involvement in last month's spate of unrest in the French Pacific territory. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758620_1_20240622230647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pro-independence leader in the French Pacific territory New Caledonia will be held in France after being charged on Saturday over deadly riots last month, his lawyer said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Christian Tein, head of the CCAT group, will be sent almost 17,000 kilometres to France with the group's communications chief Brenda Wanabo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An investigating magistrate charged Tein in New Caledonia's capital Noumea on Saturday. He was the first from a group of 11 people arrested Wednesday to be charged over the violence, in which nine people died, including two police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds more were wounded, and around $1.6 billion of damage was inflicted during the troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not immediately say what charges Tein faces, although Noumea chief prosecutor Yves Dupas said his investigation covered armed robbery and complicity in murder or attempted murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tein's lawyer Pierre Ortent said he was "stupefied" that his client would be sent to a prison in Mulhouse in eastern France. Wanabo's representative Thomas Gruet said she would be sent to Dijon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupas confirmed that some of those arrested on Wednesday would be transferred to custody in France, without giving names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one had any idea in advance that they would be sent to mainland France. These are totally exceptional steps" for New Caledonia, Ortent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gruet said Wanabo, a mother of three children, "had never called for violence" and was "distraught" to be separated from her family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The legal system has committed every error in managing this crisis," he added, saying magistrates were "answering to purely political considerations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephane Bonomo, lawyer for another detainee, Gilles Joredie, said the prosecutors actions was creating "martyrs for the independence cause".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riots, street barricades and looting broke out in New Caledonia in mid-May over an electoral reform that indigenous Kanak people said would leave them in a permanent minority, putting independence hopes definitively out of reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's government repeatedly accused Tein's CCAT of orchestrating the violence, to which it responded by sending over 3,000 troops and police to the territory. The CCAT has denied being behind the riots. (AFP)

    EU top diplomat condemns Gaza Red Cross shelling

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A boy uses a chair to transport materials as displaced Palestinian families pack their belongings to leave Rafah towards Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758616_1_20240622215939.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell on Saturday called for a probe into deadly shelling that damaged an office of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The EU condemns the shelling which damaged the ICRC office in Gaza and led to dozens of casualties. An independent investigation is needed and those responsible must be held accountable," Borrell wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, days after Israel announced a daily pause in fighting on a key route to allow more aid into Gaza, chaos in the besieged Palestinian territory has left vital supplies piled up and undistributed in the searing summer heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated UN warnings of famine with outside aid severely restricted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million population has increased as fighting rages, sparking warnings from aid agencies that they are unable to deliver aid including vegetables.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says it has let supplies in and called on agencies to step up deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza," the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, also known as OCHA, said in a briefing on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Alongside the fighting, criminal activities and the risk of theft and robbery has effectively prevented humanitarian access to critical locations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks of aid into southern Gaza, trading blame with the United Nations over why the aid is stacking up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shared aerial footage of white and black containers lined up on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and more trucks arriving to add to the stockpile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With civil order breaking down in the territory, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A deputy UN spokesman this week said the crossing "is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-seeded German Alexander Zverev fell in straight sets to Pole Hubert Hurkacz in the semi-final of the Halle grass-court tournament on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz won through 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in one-hour, 33-minute and will next play either world number one Jannik Sinner or China's Zhang Zhizhen for the title in the pre-Wimbledon warm-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-seeded Pole, winner in Halle two years ago, will bid to win his second title of the season after on clay at Estoril in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really confident on my serve," said Hurkacz who fired 17 aces including 13 in the first set and saved all four break points he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It needed to be really good," said Hurkacz after his first win over Zverev in four meetings, most recently a three-set defeat in the United Cup final, a mixed team event before the Australian Open in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That match that was a little bit sitting in the back in my mind," said Hurkacz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was like, okay, not today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is such a good competitor and is playing good tennis, reaching the final at the French (Open) and playing at a really high level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Hurkacz will aim to clinch his ninth ATP Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really love grass," said Hurkacz, the 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist. "The surface suits my game and the atmosphere here, having the full crowd is incredible." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Long March 2-C rocket carrying a satellite jointly developed by China and France dubbed the Space Variable Objects Monitor, lifts off from a space base in Xichang, in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758613_1_20240622222543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has launched a satellite in cooperation with France to catch gamma-ray bursts in the universe's outermost regions, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage delivers a speech at a hotel in Blackpool, England, in the build-up to the UK general election on July 4.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, leader of Britain's anti-immigration Reform UK party, faced strong criticism Saturday after saying that the West provoked Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with a British media outlet on Friday, Farage said "we've provoked this war", while adding that "of course" it was Russian president Vladimir Putin's "fault".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters that Farage's claim was "completely wrong and only plays into Putin's hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour leader Keir Starmer, who looks set to take Sunak's job after an election next month, said Farage's comments were "disgraceful".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anyone who is standing for parliament ought to be really clear that Russia is the aggressor", he told reporters on the campaign trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage -- a former European Union parliamentarian who has tried and failed to run for Westminster seven times -- is seeking a seat for Clacton in east England in the country's general election next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His party is polling third behind the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour parties, but is only predicted to pick up a few seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, a surge of popularity for Reform UK since Farage took over as leader this month risks drawing away votes that the Conservative party sorely needs to win a fifth term in power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments met with outrage on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister James Cleverly criticised Farage for "echoing Putin's vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood called the comments "shocking" in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, adding that "Churchill will be turning in his grave".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Labour's defence spokesman John Healey called the comments "disgraceful" and said his stance made him "unfit for any political office in our country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Probed further on his views on Putin in the interview, Farage said that he "disliked him as a person" but "admired him as a political operator because he's managed to take control of running Russia".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Brexit figurehead, Farage is close to former US President Donald Trump, who has said he gets along with Putin "great".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage has also spoken about his intention to run for prime minister in 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stood by claims that Sunak, the first UK prime minister of colour, does not "understand our culture", in response to Sunak leaving D-Day commemorations in France early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He clarified in the interview that he meant Sunak was "too upper class".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage's comments on Sunak -- first made in a political leaders debate -- also drew criticism, with one Tory minister saying they made him "very uncomfortable". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday arrested a man on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend at a Fanling flat on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 59-year-old suspect called the police at 5.23pm on Saturday to report that a woman was unresponsive at a flat in Wah Min House at Wah Sum Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramedics arrived ten minutes later and declared the woman dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Po assistant commander Brian Chung said the victim had sustained multiple bruises – mostly to her upper body – and arrested the man on the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told a media briefing that police initially suspect that an altercation had taken place at the flat on Friday stemming from a dispute over personal property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A post-mortem would be conducted to determine the cause of death, he added, and investigations are continuing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner of Police, Raymond Siu, on Saturday said the force will “resolutely enforce the law” if anyone attempts to incite or commit illegal acts that undermine social peace and the security of Hong Kong and the nation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a graduation ceremony at the Hong Kong Police College, Siu also noted that the force is stepping up online and offline intelligence gathering ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we are aware of any attempt to disrupt social peace, we shall certainly act quickly,” he told reporters after attending the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We shall make appropriate deployments to maintain national security and also Hong Kong's public safety and order. We shall make sure there are sufficient numbers of officers on duty on July 1 to ensure that all celebrations are conducted in a safer and orderly manner,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that "while society seems peaceful on the surface, there are still many ‘undercurrents’"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “External forces or some anti-China rioters, who have fled Hong Kong, have attempted to smear the National Security Law via various means, or incite others to hate the central government and the SAR government, I call on the public to be careful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Siu said there had been a significant rise in burglary cases in the city, with the number rising by 30 percent year-on-year to 604 in the first five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said village houses were especially vulnerable with break-ins rising by 170 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the cases to increased travel and called on the public to lock doors and windows when going out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course, we have also stepped up patrols - especially in areas where there are village houses,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of the city's overall criminal cases, meanwhile, stood at 36,940 in the first five months of the year, increasing by three percent from the same period a year ago, according to Siu.

    Tourism Board lauds social media portrayal of HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Director of the Hong Kong Tourism Board on Saturday hailed the usage of social media in promoting the SAR, as he hinted at new incentives in the pipeline ahead of summer holiday season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Dane Cheng said that since visitors were now focusing more on having “in-depth experiences” during their trips, and not specifically travelling for “shopping”, the board has been collaborating with social media platforms to provide travel-related content to woo visitors, including inviting influencers visit the SAR to share their travel tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we've been very effective and particularly in the mainland and overseas. A lot of the time, I think it's important that these social media are reposted or retweeted organically,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The important thing is that he content has to be genuine and authentic.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also hinted that the board was preparing a raft of new incentives for summer, and more details would be revealed next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said in the face of strong competition from Japan and the rest of Asia, there would be more event promotion to attract long-haul visitors, especially from Europe and America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Particularly with the new measure that China is increasingly opening up visa-free visits from a lot of the overseas countries. That would give Hong Kong tremendous advantages, because people can come to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong going into the mainland,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland has recently been offering more countries visa-free travel, the latest being Australia and New Zealand following Premier Li Qiang's visit to the two countries earlier this month..

    HK may need southern hemisphere flu jabs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Respiratory health expert David Hui on Saturday said Hong Kong may have to use different flu jabs if the flu season continues until the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Professor Hui said many people had been vaccinated so outbreaks have not been large in scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the SAR may also need to import vaccines from the Southern Hemisphere, where it is currently winter and the main flu season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If small-scale outbreaks continue - from the beginning of the year until the end - we'll have to import southern hemisphere vaccines in the second quarter of the year, and import northern hemisphere vaccines in the fourth quarter," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui added that people who had not been vaccinated during winter, could still get their vaccines now.

    Nasa again postpones return of Boeing Starliner
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nasa did not set a new date, raising questions about the timing of the return. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758566_1_20240622104348.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa has further postponed the Boeing Starliner's return to Earth from the International Space Station with its first crew of astronauts, to allow more time for review of technical issues encountered, the agency said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It did not set a new date, raising questions about the timing of the return of the two astronauts on Boeing's first crewed mission, which had initially been set for June 26, itself a pushback from the first potential date of June 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following the station’s two planned spacewalks on June 24 and July 2," Nasa said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, lifted off on June 5 as a final demonstration to obtain routine flight certification from Nasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process," said Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew programme manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station," Stich said, adding that the additional time would yield "valuable insight" into system upgrades for future missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crewed test of the spacecraft, test-flown to space two times since 2019 without humans on board, has encountered five failures of its 28 manoeuvring thrusters, five leaks of helium gas meant to pressurise those thrusters, and a slow-moving propellant valve that signalled unfixed past issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issues and the additional tests run by Nasa and Boeing call into question when exactly Starliner's crew will be able to make the roughly six-hour return journey home, and add to the programme's broader problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has spent US$1.5 billion in cost overruns beyond its US$4.5-billion Nasa development contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa wants Starliner to become a second US spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts with the ISS, alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, its primary ride since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Boeing's Starliner programme has battled software glitches, design problems and subcontractor disputes for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Starliner arrived in the space station's vicinity to dock on June 6, the five thruster failures prevented a close approach by the spacecraft until Boeing made a fix.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It rewrote software and tweaked some procedures to revive four of them and proceed with a docking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner's undocking and return to Earth represent the spacecraft's most complicated phases of its test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials have said they want to better understand the cause of the thruster failures, valve issue and helium leaks before Starliner begins its return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While just one thruster remains dead in Starliner's current flight, Boeing encountered four thruster problems during the capsule's uncrewed return from space in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flight rules set by Boeing and Nasa require Starliner's manoeuvring thrusters to allow for "six degrees of freedom of control," at a minimum, and each have one backup thruster, a Nasa spokesperson told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That could mean at least 12 of the 28 thrusters, most of them backups, are required for a safe flight. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said. The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 112 km south of Little Rock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody," Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident," she said. (Reuters)

    Taxi fleets must maintain service quality: government

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the service quality of some taxi drivers was disappointing, but he expects the situation to improve with the introduction of a licensed taxi fleet system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government is expected to approve up to five licenses, out of 15 applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Lam said taxi fleets must maintain their service quality level to keep the license.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Transport Department will monitor the taxi fleets to see whether or not they are performing well and offer reminders if they are not. In a worse case scenario, we can cancel their license," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's a monitoring system, so I'm confident the taxi fleets will provide a high-quality service and therefore enhance the service quality for the whole taxi industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam also said the authorities are looking into whether licenses are needed for ride-hailing services. He said discussions will be made with the sector and lawmakers in July.

  Asked about whether he would seek re-election during a media interview, the SAR leader said "being the Chief Executive is a mission". Lee's current five-year term ends in June 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this mission, there is only one thought. You execute your tasks to the best of your abilities; always be dedicated, selfless and try to do as much as possible. Treat that as your only mission, think about nothing else and you will achieve the best results and satisfy the mission's requirements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's top official also refused to rate his own performance, only saying he would leave it to others to assess his work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if there had been difficult calls to make over the past two years, Lee said none of the decisions were easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm pleased to see that so far I get a lot of support from my team, which helps me in making difficult decisions. And I am thankful to a lot of people who are very willing to offer their opinions to me. That also helps me to make difficult decisions," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But all decisions are difficult. There's no easy thing for the Chief Executive, when I have to take care of the interests of 7.5 million people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Likewise, Lee felt it was hard to gauge the individual performances of his cabinet officials, given that "each policy has a different starting point". That said, he acknowledged all of them had met his requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would describe my team as a boat. This boat, firstly, has to move forward. Secondly, it has to move faster and faster. Thirdly, and most importantly, it has to be in the right direction. If it's in the right direction, we will eventually reach our destination. If [the boat] is faster, we'll get there faster," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After [reaching] one goal, we move on to the next and handle things one step at a time."

    Vital to prepare for economic transition, says CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has stressed the need to rethink how Hong Kong should position itself amid an economic transition, while warning of challenges brought by geopolitical uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Having served nearly two years in office, the city's leader said it's important to quickly identify ways to address changes the SAR is now experiencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must try to shorten the awakening and recognition phases as much as possible,” Lee said in a media interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we see changes, instead of remaining in the old way of thinking, it is better to recognise early that it is time to transform and acknowledge the need to make changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR leader noted, for example, some businesses have stopped chasing sales figures and are now looking for ways to improve service quality instead .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After completing "the most important political task" of passing Basic Law Article 23 legislation, Hong Kong can now focus on the economy and people's livelihood, Lee added, noting the economy has rebounded from contractions when he first took office in July 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chief Executive cautioned the SAR would continue to be affected by geopolitical uncertainties, as well as foreign interference in the city’s affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[There is] no use [for foreign countries] to try to make use of Hong Kong as a political tool to try to, for example, pressure our country or pressure Hong Kong, in order to achieve their political purpose... It will backfire, because by doing that, they lose their credibility in their own citizens," Lee warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A sound financial development is also key to avoid political instability, Lee added, judging from his exchanges with consuls-general in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the government leader confirmed plans to embark on more duty visits overseas. His cabinet will start with regions which "bring the best return", such as Asean member nations and the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Europe is a "big region" that the SAR must tap into, while Central Asia is another area of interest, if time permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finding time to cover that wide range of visits is a big challenge as well. There will be some division of labour … among government officials, and also … between the government and private sectors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In respect of raising the reputation and telling the good Hong Kong story to different countries, the private sector, of course, plays an important role as well, because they have their own network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have also, through their network, built up strong links with different opinion leaders as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee vowed to continue seeking support for Hong Kong's accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, as around 70 percent of the city's trade is conducted with economies under the pact.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell slightly overnight after Nvidia shares dropped for a second day, dragging down the technology sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Technology was the biggest loser among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, weighed by Nvidia, while communication services led the gain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's Nvidia's game, and the rest of us are just pretending to be here,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management in Philadelphia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically all the activity is now concentrated in Nvidia call options," he added. "Seven million option contracts Nvidia have traded. That's something in the neighborhood of three or four times the quantity of contract volume that would have traded for the market in total five years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose a tenth of a percent, to 39,162. The S&P 500 lost a fifth of a percent, to end at 5,468, while the Nasdaq lost a fifth of a percent, to 17,693.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of megacaps Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple rose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We've had a very strong run, especially in the S&P over the last couple weeks. So not surprised to see things kind of take a pause and settle down,” Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's trading could be more volatile than usual due to triple witching, the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index options, and stock index futures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  U.S. business activity reached a 26-month high in June amid a rebound in employment, while easing price pressures suggested the recent inflation slowdown may continue. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Poland's Robert Lewandowski (right) looks dejected after the 3-1 defeat. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758551_1_20240622081006.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Austria claimed a convincing 3-1 win over Poland in Berlin on Friday to take a step towards the Euro 2024 knock-out rounds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Robert Lewandowski returned from a thigh injury as a substitute for Poland, now on the brink of elimination from Group D after two defeats, but could not help his team make inroads against Ralf Rangnick's sturdy side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland striker Krzysztof Piatek levelled Gernot Trauner's opener, but Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic's second-half goals earned Austria three vital points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria dominated the opening stages and Trauner powered home a header at the near post from the enterprising Phillipp Mwene's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piatek levelled for Poland after half an hour, staying calm in the box when a rebound fell his way and slotting into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the game level approaching the hour mark, Poland coach Michal Probierz sent on Lewandowski, who took the captain's armband.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Showing little concern about his injury, the forward charged around and quickly picked up a booking for catching Philipp Lienhart with his arm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria regained the lead after 67 minutes when Arnautovic cleverly stepped over a pass received by Baumgartner, who stroked into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Baumgartner celebrated wildly with Rangnick and gave the former interim Manchester United coach credit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He supports me every day and gave me a lot of strength at half-time," explained the midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He talked to me for three or four minutes, so the thanks went to him too."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran captain Arnautovic, 35, sealed the win with a late penalty after Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny felled Marcel Sabitzer. (Reuters)

    Slovakia try to shrug off loss to Ukraine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia remain underdogs in Euro 2024 and are determined to make a good run in the tournament, coach Francesco Calzona said on Friday, hailing a crop of players who performed well even in defeat against a determined Ukraine side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovakia started the Group E match strongly with a succession of chances leading to Ivan Schranz netting his second goal of the championship in the 17th minute, but a resolute Ukraine fought back to level the score after the break and stunned the Slovakians with another 10 minutes from time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia came into the match with 10 wins from the last 14 games, including their shock 1-0 victory over Belgium on Monday, and needed just one more to advance early to the next round of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had the opportunity but we knew that we were coming up against a team that had to win at all costs to stay in the hunt to make it through to the knockout stage," Italian Calzona said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us we are the Cinderella story of the group stage so the fact that we're already here and competing to make it through to the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team try and play football against anyone regardless of the opposition and I'm very proud of that fact," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defeat for Slovakia will be a reminder of their last Euros, when their opening victory was followed by two defeats, including a 5-0 drubbing by Spain, and an early exit from the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calzona said the loss to Ukraine was all about the strength of a team that was desperate to make amends for their 3-0 trouncing by Romania, Slovakia's next opponents. Romania play Belgium on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we led this evening there was still a long way to go. We played very strong opposition, we know that. I am happy with my team's performance, we produced a great display, I'm very proud of my lads," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few months ago it would have been inconceivable that our team could play against these strong sides." (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French star Kylian Mbappe remained on the bench after suffering a broken nose. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758549_1_20240622075014.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France missed Kylian Mbappe in a wasteful display against the Netherlands but keeping their main man on the bench rather than risk him so soon after a broken nose may prove clever if he returns to help Les Bleus go deep into Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mbappe, who had run riot against the Dutch in the past with six goals in five games, was ready to come on with a mask.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he remained an unused substitute in the tournament's first 0-0 draw - a disappointing spectacle given the two sides' pedigree but a result that leaves both on four points and virtually through to the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the absence of Mbappe, 33-year-old Antoine Griezmann took the captain's armband and also occupied his attacking space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he failed to convert a stream of chances, twice getting the ball caught under his feet when right in front of goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France enjoyed 58% possession, completed 614 passes to the Netherlands' 353, and had double the number of goal attempts at 16. But coach Didier Deschamps may not worry too much about the team's profligacy, given their control of large periods of the game and the likelihood of Mbappe's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether the forward is rested for the last group game against Poland remains to be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he is back on the pitch, Mbappe, 25, will have a point to prove: he has never scored at a Euros tournament and in 2021 his penalty was saved in a shootout with Switzerland which saw France exit at the last 16 stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, he has 12 goals at World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Griezmann missed a header, several shots and those couple of bundled close-range opportunities, Marcus Thuram also fluffed his chances and veteran Olivier Giroud made little impact when he came on in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France looked lethargic at times, despite dominating possession, and were perhaps lucky to come across a Dutch side lacking any real threat up front to match the quality of their Virgil van Dijk-marshalled defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands were dismayed, however, when Xavi Simons thought he had scored, only to see the goal disallowed because Denzel Dumfries was deemed to be interfering with play as he stood offside next to goalkeeper Mike Maignan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At times, it almost looked like both sides were happy to settle for a draw, trusting that four points would be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With already-eliminated Poland to come next for France, while the Dutch have a trickier task against Austria, Didier Deschamps' side look the likelier of the two heavyweights to top Group D and ensure a better draw in the knockout stage. (Reuters)

    Chris Tang accuses RFA of endangering security

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758497_1_20240621205748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang on Friday accused Radio Free Asia (RFA) of endangering national security by spreading misleading and false information in its report on the renewal of smart ID cards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news agency published an article accusing the government of "threatening" overseas Hongkongers, saying they could face jail if they didn't return to Hong Kong to renew their cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the government said the station was confusing different laws - and those who don't renew on time will only be fined $5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said whether charges would be brought against the station would depend on the evidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At first, I didn't understand why the outlet left Hong Kong [after Article 23]. Now I know why. It's because the relevant ordinance targets those endangering national security and the security of Hong Kong," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But you see, what this outlet does from afar is that it uses inaccurate information, and comes up with ways to incite the people to distrust or hate the government. These are exactly the sort of potentially illegal activities that we target in safeguarding national security."

<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union countries on Friday formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova next week, another step in the two nations' long journey to join the 27-nation bloc.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Belgium, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, said member states have agreed on a negotiating framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This opens the way for launching the negotiations on Tuesday 25 June in Luxembourg,” the Belgian presidency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a positive assessment from the bloc’s executive branch, EU leaders had already agreed last year that accession negotiations should start with both countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The process between the start of negotiations with Ukraine and its neighbour Moldova and their becoming EU member states could take many years. (AP)

 Armenia has officially recognised a Palestinian state, the Armenian foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, the latest country to do so despite opposition from Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's foreign ministry said it summoned Armenia's ambassador to Israel after the former Soviet republic declared its recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following Armenia's recognition of a Palestinian state, the foreign ministry summoned the Armenian ambassador in Israel for a severe reprimand," it said in a statement shortly after Armenia's announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia supports a United Nations resolution on an immediate ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and is in favour of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the same statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, welcomed Armenia’s decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This recognition contributes positively to preserving the two-state solution, which faces systematic challenges, and promotes security, peace, and stability for all parties involved," the Authority's presidency said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain, Ireland and Norway were among several Western countries to officially recognise a Palestinian state, prompting Israel to pull its ambassadors from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo last month. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Accounting firm Deloitte on Friday said it had slashed its projections for Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) fundraising by up to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deloitte now expects to see 80 new listings to generate between HK$60 billion and HK$80 billion of proceeds, down from its previous estimate of HK$100 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southern Region Managing Partner of Deloitte China, Edward Au, attributed the downgrade in expectations to the uncertainty surrounding the US interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut timing will affect the flow of funds into Hong Kong, because I think definitely investors would wait, regarding the risk and return,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They actually want to invest in more tangible [assets], and companies with concrete profits or paths to profit.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the lowering of Deloitte's forecast, Au expected that Hong Kong would be among the top five global IPO venues in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ultimately, Au was optimistic that more mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the second half of the year, as their valuations would rise if the US Federal Reserve reduced its rates, as some have projected, resulting in an appreciation of the renminbi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another accountancy giant, KPMG, which released its revised projections on Tuesday, expected that IPO fundraising in Hong Kong would generate at most HK$60 billion in revenue in 2024.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in May year-on-year, up slightly from the 1.1 percent increase recorded in April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Census and Statistics Department figures released on Friday showed there was a 20.1 percent increase in the price of alcoholic drinks and tobacco, a 3 percent rise in the price of meals out and takeaways, and a 2.3 percent increase in transport costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said inflation should remain contained in the near future, but domestic cost pressures may increase as the local economy continues to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "External price pressures should continue to stay on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties. The government will continue to monitor the situation," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong basketball player David Muoka has declared he would enter the NBA draft next week, in a bid to become the first athlete from the SAR to make the league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre, 23, stands at six foot 10 inches, and graduated from Hong Kong's West Island School in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muoka spent the past season playing for Long Island in the NBA's developmental league, the G League, averaging 4.5 points, five rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game in 38 appearances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the first Hongkonger selected by the G League after being picked third overall by the Capital City Go-Go in last year's draft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big man spent two years collegiately at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), after previously securing a scholarship at Lamar University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was named Southland Conference Defensive Player of the Year for the 2020-21 season by averaging 5.4 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.9 blocks a game as a sophomore at Lamar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said Friday that the European Union was to blame for escalating trade frictions with China, which could lead to a "trade war".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Responsibility lies entirely with the EU side," a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hoped the EU would meet it halfway, handle differences through dialogue and avoid escalating trade friction or allowing it to get out of control, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the European Commission proposed tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicle imports from China despite Beijing's protest, plunging trade ties to a new low and risking punitive action from the world's second-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry statement was published just before the arrival of German Economy Minister Robert Habeck in Beijing, where he was expected to explain to Chinese officials the recent tariff announcement while allaying the risk of retaliation that could harm German businesses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The authorities on Friday said builders put up the wrong pre-fabricated wall while constructing subsidised flats in Yuen Long and have since been told to fix the mistake.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos posted on social media recently showed the incorrect wall at Long Tin Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Housing Department said the construction firm had mixed up two walls of the same size that have different window designs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The structure of the building is unaffected because the pre-fabricated wall involved is a non-structural component," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the Housing Authority's construction team will closely monitor the performance of the contractor to ensure the safety and quality of the estate, which is due to be completed in early 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department stressed that the authorities have a good system for managing construction contracts, as well as stringent inspection procedures to ensure the quality of buildings.

    Proposed changes to harbour protection laws revised

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Protection of the Harbour Ordinance limits reclamation in Victoria Harbour to projects that have an overriding public need. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758429_1_20240621130818.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has revised its proposal to relax a general ban on reclamation in Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Originally, it suggested that temporary reclamation projects with an area of up to three hectares should be exempt from harbour protection laws, as long as each phase of the project lasts no more than three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a new paper submitted to Legco, the Development Bureau notes that it didn't propose a cap on the number of phases each project could have and in light of this, it is suggesting a seven-year limit for the total duration of a project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reclamation work could be extended for a year if approval is granted by the financial secretary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau is also proposing to exempt three types of harbour enhancement work from the "presumption against reclamation", covering the construction of ramps, spaces for boat repairs, and wave absorbing infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Harbour-improvement" reclamation involving less than 0.8 hectares would also be exempt from protection laws under the government's proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Andrew Lam, the vice-chair of Legco's development panel, said the proposed seven-year limit for projects exemptions will ensure that temporary reclamation doesn't end up being permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would provide a better certainty to put the cap at seven years. That would be better than a three plus three and... another three... which eventually goes nowhere," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he believes the law changes will enable more harbourfront projects to be launched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, the government actually tried not to start any project because of the risk of being taken to court by any individual who believes the nature of the project does not have the need for the well-being of the society as a whole," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bill to amend the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance is expected to be submitted to Legco by the end of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s military on Friday said it had fired warnings shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who temporarily crossed the demarcation line between the two countries for the third time this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers while engaging in unspecified construction work on the northern side of the border briefly intruded the military demarcation line that bisects the countries at around 11am on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean military in response broadcast a warning and fired warning shots, to which the North Korean soldiers retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint chiefs didn't immediately release more details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s military has said it believes the previous two border intrusions this month weren’t intentional as the North Korean soldiers retreated after the warning shots and the North did not return fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South’s military said it had been observing increased North Korean construction activity in front-line border areas since April, such as installing suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforcing roads and planting land mines. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Official data released on Friday showed the number of bankruptcy petitions in Hong Kong had risen to the highest level in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to figures by the Official Receiver’s Office, there were 871 bankruptcy petitions in May, 17 percent higher on a monthly basis, and 35 percent higher from a year ago, while marking the highest number since April 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of bankruptcy orders by the court, however, significantly dropped last month, standing at 624.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was nearly 27 percent less compared with April when it hit a three-year high, and nine percent lower year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also received 61 compulsory winding-up petitions in May, eight percent lower than April, but 85 percent higher from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also 43 winding-up orders by the court last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Simon Lee, honorary fellow at Chinese University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Business, said that higher borrowing costs were a factor in the latest surge in bankruptcies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The high interest rates have been persisting for quite a long time, the economy still remains weak for some sectors,” Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And for those who didn't manage their debts well when they purchased their residential accommodations, I think they experienced all the hardship.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The economics professor also noted that an overall downward trend in the city’s property prices had also added to the cashflow woes of both individuals and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Usually people create wealth from the properties, but now that the property prices have dropped about 16 percent in the past two years, and the industry remains weak.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If the properties’ values are depreciating, for property owners, no matter if they sell the properties or use the properties as a guarantee [to secure bank loans], their cash flow status will remain weak, and this will increase the chance of having bankruptcies,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, meanwhile, said via social media that the latest figures “cannot accurately reflect the city's economic situation”, as the monthly data are volatile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s economy grew 2.7 percent in the first quarter, while the jobless rate hovered at around three percent with moderate inflation, the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also estimated the city would welcome a total of 46 million visitors this year, which would be 35 percent more compared with last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government will keep promoting the mega-event economy and improve consumption sentiment...to further improve the city’s competitiveness.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee agreed the latest bankruptcy indicators alone could not reflect the city’s overall economic recovery, but called on authorities to do more to help small-and-medium-sized businesses survive, such as to further implement measures for them to defer their principal payments on corporate loans and mortgages.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kwong Wah Hospital said a malfunction in the backup power system for the operating theatres was the main cause of a power disruption on Wednesday evening that affected 25 non-urgent surgeries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty-three elective surgeries scheduled on Thursday had to be postponed and two other elective surgeries were moved to other operating rooms, the hospital said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that while the main power supply was working fine, it had decided to shut down eight operating theatres as a precaution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Preliminary investigation by the contractor who installed the electricity supply system revealed that there was a malfunction of the control components in the uninterrupted power supply system which is the third tier backup power supply source and this malfunction affected the operation of the third tier backup power supply system in the operating theatres," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Affected by the incident, 23 elective surgeries originally scheduled for [Thursday] needed to be postponed and two elective surgeries needed to be transferred to another unaffected operating theatres. The two surgeries were both performed uneventfully.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson said that the contractor had replaced the faulty components in the system and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department was conducting independent tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the affected surgeries were expected to gradually resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital added the patient who was moved to another theatre when the outage happened on Wednesday had a complication, but it said that was not related to being moved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Serbian football association threatened to pull the team out of the European Championship over chants made during Wednesday's draw between Albania and Croatia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jovan Surbatovic, the General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia [FSS], told Serbian broadcaster RTS that the country demanded action from authorities over remarks made during the match, including the chant: "Kill, kill, kill the Serb".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surbatovic told RTS the FSS would seek sanctions from UEFA "even at the cost of not continuing the competition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, UEFA, the governing body of European football, said it has opened a probe into the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An ethics and disciplinary inspector has been appointed to "conduct an investigation regarding potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct by supporters" during the match, a statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A probe has also been opened in "relation to the alleged inappropriate behaviour of the Albanian Football Association [FSHF] player Mirlind Daku", the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian media reported that Daku initiated vulgar chants against Serbs and Macedonians. (AFP)

 World champions Argentina opened their bid for back-to-back Copa America titles with a 2-0 win over Canada in front of a 70,564 crowd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez put Argentina ahead in the 49th minute but a combination of inspired goalkeeping from Canada's Max Crepeau and Lionel Messi's surprising lack of precision in front of goal ensured that the underdogs were in the game until Lautaro Martinez settled the contest in the 88th minute.

    Eric Chan says skilled worker policies bearing fruit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan said government policies to attract skilled workers were bearing fruit, with the number far exceeding the 35,000 annual target set by the chief executive. Chan said about 120,000 people had already moved here through different migration schemes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary was speaking in an interview with RTHK to mark the second anniversary of the current administration's term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past year or so, we've successfully attracted over 300,000 applications. If we include the applicants' family members, we estimate some 700,000 people will come to the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are all talents. Frankly, they're voting with their feet, showing their confidence in Hong Kong. I believe this shows our outstanding advantages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development said Hong Kong had risen to fifth in its competitiveness ranking with Chan saying this was proof that, in the eyes of the international community, the SAR was gradually moving forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said he thought people making cross-border leisure trips to Shenzhen was a form of patriotic education, especially for the young.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot hard sell patriotism. It must be a soft sell - through things like exhibitions, movies, music, interviews and visits - for young people to genuinely feel that the country's improved," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So many people go north of the border to consume nowadays. This is also a form of patriotic education, because once they go north to have a look, they can know more about the country and its improvements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary said, ultimately, patriotism needs to become "a mainstream core value".

    Think-tanks call for more support for entrepreneurs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A researcher with the Our Hong Kong Foundation says young SAR entrepreneurs in Guangzhou need more work experience. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758386_1_20240621091224.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Think-tanks are urging Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more training and job placements to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move comes after a research team from the Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation visited two entrepreneurial bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou in September. They were set up to support young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kynita Wong is the foundation's assistant researcher, who travelled to Guangzhou with the team. Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, she said one of the challenges was that the centres were offering services that were too similar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From our visit to entrepreneur bases we observed there's a tendency towards homogeneity. And because the services offered are pretty similar, the convergence of the bases make it difficult for the young entrepreneurs to choose suitable incubation centres," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And also because the entrepreneur bases are relying on the rental and service fees so they provide more of a basic service but not much of an investment function."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said these challenges hindered the ability of the entrepreneurs to fully capitalise on the opportunities available in Guangzhou, which was why they are asking for more support from authorities on both sides of the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first one that we recommend to provide is the short-term employment skills training in related industries to help youth acquire the relevant skills and experience," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are trying to propose the use of the 'employment first, entrepreneurship later' model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said during their training, the young entrepreneurs would gain a better understanding of society on the mainland and this would help them to create networks.

    Lakers to bring in JJ Redick as new head coach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 J.J. Redick, an NBA television analyst for ESPN, has agreed to a four-year deal to become the new head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, ESPN reported Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Redick, 39, played 15 seasons in the NBA but has no prior coaching experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That didn't matter to the Lakers, who reportedly made Redick their top target after UConn coach Dan Hurley rejected a six-year, $70 million offer to leave the college ranks – where he is a two-time reigning national champion – for Hollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Redick co-hosts a basketball podcast with Lakers star LeBron James, launched last March. James is due to become a free agent at the start of the new league year but can opt into a $51.4 million player option to stay in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers fired coach Darvin Ham after two seasons, including an appearance in the Western Conference finals in 2023. Ham posted a 90-74 record but was 9-12 in the playoffs since replacing Frank Vogel in 2022. (Reuters/AFP)

    Spain reach Euro knockouts, Denmark thwart England

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain secured a spot in the knockout stages of Euro 2024 with a 1-0 victory over Italy in their heavyweight clash on Thursday, after England struggled to show their credentials in a 1-1 draw with Denmark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three-time winners Spain got the better of reigning champions Italy at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen as Riccardo Calafiori bundled the ball into his own net 10 minutes after half-time to decide the encounter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second win in as many matches for Spain is enough for them to secure top spot in Group B with a game to spare, meaning they already know they will play their last-16 tie in Cologne on June 30 against one of the best third-place finishers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy, meanwhile, are not through yet but a point against Croatia in Leipzig on Monday will clinch second place in the group for Luciano Spalletti's team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sides were meeting at a fifth consecutive European Championship and Spain should have won by a far greater margin as they sought revenge for a defeat on penalties in the semi-finals at Wembley three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made several key saves while Lamine Yamal came close from distance in the second half for La Roja and the outstanding Nico Williams smashed a shot off the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, England could have secured a last-16 spot as well as they took on Denmark in Frankfurt in Group C but produced an underwhelming performance that leaves more questions over their chances of becoming European champions for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of the Euro 2020 semi-final won by England, it was Gareth Southgate's men who got off to a perfect start when Harry Kane slotted home after Kyle Walker caught Danish defender Victor Kristiansen napping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark, though, were worthy of at least a point and got it thanks to a spectacular strike by Morten Hjulmand before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Foden hit the post for England and Denmark's Andreas Christensen came close to a late winner in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a share of the spoils leaves all to play for in the final games of Group C next Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's other match in Group C also ended in a 1-1 draw, as Luka Jovic snatched a point for Serbia in the 95th minute to hold Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zan Karnicnik had headed Slovenia in front 21 minutes from time in Munich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Serbia kept their fate of reaching the last 16 in their own hands when AC Milan striker Jovic headed in a corner with virtually the last action of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England top the group on four points, two clear of Denmark and Slovenia, and just need a draw when they face Slovenia in Cologne to be sure of qualifying. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Thursday he was "incredibly angry" after more Conservative Party figures were put under investigation over alleged bets placed on the UK general election date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Facing questions on the growing scandal from an audience of voters on live television, the beleaguered leader said any election candidates or officials found to have broken rules would be kicked out of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came hours after the Conservatives' campaign director stepped aside following reports that he and his wife, a Tory candidate in the July 4 election, were under investigation by betting regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, another would-be MP, Craig Williams, who was a Sunak ministerial aide, was also being probed for staking £100 (US$127) on the date before it was called.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London police said on Wednesday that one of the prime minister's police security detail had been arrested for allegedly placing a bet on the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was incredibly angry... to learn of these allegations," Sunak said of the cases involving his party officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Conservatives confirmed earlier that campaign director Tony Lee had started "a leave of absence" and that the Gambling Commission was looking into "a number of individuals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regulator did not name individuals but the BBC reported that Lee and his election candidate wife Laura Saunders were under investigation. Her lawyers said she would "be co-operating with the Gambling Commission" and claimed the report infringed her privacy rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission had already said it was looking at the claims regarding Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Political bets are allowed in the UK, including on the date of elections, but using insider knowledge to do so is against the law. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday, as market bellwether Nvidia retreated from earlier gains, while investors evaluated recent economic data and commentary from Federal Reserve officials to determine the timing of interest-rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the S&P 500 hit the crucial 5,500-point mark for the first time ever, a year-end target multiple brokerages had forecast. Nasdaq ended a seven-session streak of record closing highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Nvidia dropped 3.54 percent after rising earlier in the session. The chipmaker dethroned Microsoft on Tuesday to become the most valuable public company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dell and Super Micro Computer also declined 0.42 percent and 0.26 percent respectively after an initial increase, following news that they received server orders for Elon Musk's AI startup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined last week, but the latest data showed that the overall number of people on benefits rolls reached the highest level since January, indicating that the US job market continues to cool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another set of data showed US single-family homebuilding fell in May amid continued high mortgage rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The news that we got today was just another negative weakness in the economy”, said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta. “In the employment report, you're getting those (unemployment) claims that are not terrible, but it's.. getting into a territory that's not low necessarily anymore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said it would take a year or two to get inflation back to 2 percent, as wage growth might still be too high, spurring worries of interest rates staying elevated for longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.77 percent, to 39,135, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 percent, to 5,473 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.79 percent, to 17,722.

    Deadly heatwaves on four continents as summer begins

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Record temperatures in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across Asia and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius, according to reports from foreign authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Countries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40C this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat. But New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C at 1am. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in films such as "M*A*S*H," "Klute," "Ordinary People" and the "Hunger Games" films, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tall actor with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and mischievous smile managed to switch effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads, opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included a rascally Army surgeon in "M*A*S*H" (1970), a quirky tank commander in "Kelly's Heroes" (1970), a small-town detective in "Klute" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in "Animal House" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1978) and a despairing father in "Ordinary People" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in "The Hunger Games" (2012) and its sequels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life," Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017. (Reuters)

    Putin says he may change nuclear weapons doctrine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia was thinking about possible changes to its doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The existing doctrine states that Russia may use such weapons in response to a nuclear attack or in the event of a conventional attack that poses an existential threat to the state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the war in Ukraine, some hawks among Russian military analysts have been advocating that Russia should lower its threshold for nuclear use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said, however, that there was no need for Russia to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was speaking to reporters a day after visiting nuclear-armed North Korea for a summit with its leader, Kim Jong Un. The two leaders signed a treaty under which each side promised to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against either one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian state media quoted Putin as saying that Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to use North Korean soldiers in the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also said he did not rule out Russia supplying high-precision weapons to North Korea. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian President Klaus Iohannis withdrew from the race to lead Nato on Thursday, clearing the way for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to become the next secretary-general of the transatlantic military alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All other Nato members had already backed Rutte, a staunch ally of Ukraine and outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to take over from Jens Stoltenberg, who is stepping down this year after a decade in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the war in Ukraine on Nato's doorstep and European nations concerned about the possible return of Nato-critical Donald Trump to the White House, alliance members concluded the highly experienced Rutte was the best person for the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As it announced Iohannis's decision, Romania's supreme defence council said it would donate one of the country's two operational Patriot systems to Ukraine, responding to pleas from Kyiv to its allies for more air defence assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Romania's decision "will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme council, which is chaired by Iohannis, said the president had informed Nato last week of his decision to withdraw and Romania would now support Rutte's candidacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all 32 Nato members now backing the Dutchman, diplomats said they expected the alliance's governing North Atlantic Council to formally select him for the post in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia, while guarding against any escalation that could draw Nato directly into a war with Moscow. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested 84 people in a three-day operation targeting the illegal use of electric mobility devices in northern New Territories.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 17 and 76, were nabbed on suspicion of various offences, such as driving an unregistered vehicle, driving without a licence, and using a vehicle without third-party insurance. All of them have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers also seized 69 electric bikes and 15 e-scooters. Around one-third of them were allegedly used for food delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting chief inspector Ngai Siu-cheong also noted that the battery-propelled devices were commonly used by parents with young children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that many parents would use these electric mobility devices to drop off or pick up their children from school and for daily commute. Some even modified their electric bikes by adding more seats. In some cases, the parents would carry two to three kids on one bicycle," Ngai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the speed of such powered devices could reach up to 50 kilometres per hour. Many arrested parents did not have a valid driving licence either, meaning they could not properly follow the signs and rules, endangering other road users.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Days of torrential rain, flash floods and landslides across southern China have forced authorities to enact emergency plans, as swollen rivers threaten to overflow further, potentially disrupting the lives of millions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Guangdong upgraded an emergency response plan for disasters like landslides and flooding to the second-highest level, helping to coordinate and deploy resources across the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other provinces have already activated a Level-IV emergency response for flood control as this year's flooding season kicked into high gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain and landslides in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have already killed at least nine people and left several people missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Guilin, a major city in Guangxi in southwest China, raised a "red" flood warning signal, the highest level, late on Wednesday when the water level of the Li River, which runs through the city, reached 3.61 metres above the warning line, China Daily reported on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The water level at the river's hydrological station in Rongjiang township hit a record high, threatening residents' lives and properties along the river, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guilin authorities urged departments, townships and scenic spots to help prevent and combat possible flooding in the coming days as water levels at major rivers continue to rise, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate to heavy rain is expected to start again from Friday through Monday in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest waterway in Asia, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's jobless rate stood unchanged at three percent in the three-month period ending in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.2 percent, compared with 1.1 percent in the February-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday showed that about 2,500 people became jobless during the latest period, taking the tally to 116,200, while the number of underemployed people rose by 4,200 to 44,700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable increases in the underemployment rate were observed in sectors including decoration, repair, building maintenance, cleaning, arts, entertainment and recreation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total employment, meanwhile, increased by about 2,800 to about 3.69 million, and the labour force also increased by about 5,300 to 3.81 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest data, Labour Secretary Chris Sun said the jobless rate remained low.

  He said the city's labour market "should stay tight in the near term alongside the continued economic growth".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong was a metropolis that embraced ethnic diversity, amid calls for more support for minorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony unveiling the Diversity List, which honoured 21 people with an ethnic minority background for their contributions to the city, Chan said the government had enhanced support for minorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chief Executive, in his Policy Address last year, expanded the government's support for our ethnic minority communities in education, employment, integration into the community and support services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That includes setting up two additional support service centres. Eight ethnic minority care teams will begin service next month, with two others expected to be in place by year’s end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shalini Mahtani, the founder and the CEO of The Zubin Foundation, an NGO which aims to improve the lives of marginalised communities in the city, urged the government to include ethnic minorities in the campaign of "telling the good stories of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To ask the government to use multi-ethnic faces and stories to tell the Hong Kong stories. Because there are so many great stories in this community, and to use these faces and these stories both locally and internationally," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Diversity List, which was launched by The Zubin Foundation, featured 21 people from seven ethnic groups and across a wide range of expertise, such as financial services, legal services and education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong-born Saajandeep Singh, who was one of the honourees and an admitted solicitor in the SAR, called on the government to increase the number of ethnic minorities on its care teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the government can always offer more support. They are doing great initiatives at the moment, but obviously they will need to provide more funding to ensure that these programmes continue and they are far-reaching, and they are not only in specific areas of Hong Kong, but they are district-wide," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that they have ethnic minority care teams nowadays, but I think they will need a greater number of people involved in these teams."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a series of deals with his Vietnamese counterpart To Lam during a state visit that comes as Moscow sought to bolster ties in Asia to offset growing international isolation over its military actions in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two signed agreements to further cooperation on education, science and technology, energy, climate change and health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Strengthening a comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam is always one of our priorities,” said Putin, according to Russian news agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived at Vietnam’s Presidential Palace on Thursday afternoon, where he was greeted by school children waving Russian and Vietnamese flags. There he shook hands with and embraced Vietnam’s new President To Lam before a bilateral meeting and a joint briefing to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived in Hanoi early Thursday morning from North Korea, where he and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed an agreement that pledged mutual aid in the event of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strategic pact could mark the strongest connection between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War and comes as both face escalating standoffs with the West. (AP)

    University tuition fees to rise 17.6% over three years

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tuition fees at public universities will increase by HK$2,400 next year, with further rises of around the same amount planned for each of the following two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After an almost three-decade-long freeze in annual fees, the current HK$42,100 charge for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will rise to HK$44,500 in 2025/26, HK$47,000 in 2026/27 and HK$49,500 in 2027/28 – an increase of almost 17.6 percent over the three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For sub-degree programmes, the current HK$15,040 will reach HK$17,800 by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson on Thursday said the administration is working to strike a balance between maintaining its fiscal discipline and ensuring that higher education remains affordable for students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the last tuition fees adjustment in the 1997/98 academic year, the Composite Consumer Price Index has increased by 40 percent cumulatively. Comparatively, the tuition fees adjustment is very modest this time," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The UGC-funded universities provide other financial assistance such as scholarships, bursaries and loans to needy students to ensure that no qualified students will be denied access to higher education due to financial difficulties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration also said its target cost recovery rate for tuition fee levels of 18 percent, set in the early 1990s, had been declining due to more expenditure being needed to deliver higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate is projected to drop to 12.5 percent in the next academic year, before improving slightly in 2027 to 13.4 percent following the tuition fee increases, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan stressed that the decision to put up fees has nothing to do with the government's budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't adjusted the tuition fee for more than 20 years, so we believe there is a need to moderately adjust the tuition fee. Our goal is to subsidise students with 82 percent of their tuition fee, but we are above this target," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our plan is to increase the fees in the upcoming three years. We don't have any plan to increase the fees after three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation welcomed the move, while calling for more support for students from lower-income families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 5.5 percent [average annual increase] is somewhat mild, because we are talking about inflation of about two to three percent. We are just slightly above that, trying to catch up a little bit, in terms of the cost recovery," said Victor Kwok, the group's assistant research director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously, on the other hand, as they gradually increase the tuition fees, they also have to proportionally increase their support, in terms of students loans, and in terms of student grants, for students from relatively less well-off families."

    Miniature art exhibition to showcase HK landmarks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A miniature artist on Thursday said that an exhibition showcasing unique Central and Western District landmarks would deepen people's understanding of Hong Kong's rich history and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Look Closer and Wonder: Central and Western District in Miniature" exhibition will display 22 artworks, with nine pieces new to the collection, in celebration of the 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Poon, president of the Joyful Miniature Association, hoped the artworks could give people a fresh perspective of familiar sites in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Central and Western District is very unique. First of all, because it is the heart of Hong Kong's political, economic, financial centre and it's also a cultural centre. From this area, you can see the earliest transportation, colonial architecture and also in terms of food, for example, you have cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong style cafe) and you also have a lot of declared monuments like the Man Mo Temple," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, you have the most classic and oldest [buildings], and on the other hand, you have the highest skyscrapers all at once. It's a melting pot of East meets West. You have Lan Kwai Fong out there, it's the gist of Hong Kong, everything that is the best is here, in Central and Western District."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One artist Hung Fai-chan spent a year recreating the corridors of an old public housing estate called "We All Grew Up Like This". He said he wanted to capture the memories of childhood games, before electronics, that many Hong Kong people grew up with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of my own memories inside this piece too because I also grew up in public housing. I have a few siblings myself so I wanted to capture the childhood games we used to play, like rock, paper, scissors up the stairs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also simpler games like marble shooting or even table tennis on the ground. These are all the games we would play as a child, like many children in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another artist Tim Ho worked with a team to recreate the Man Mo Temple in Sheung Wan. He said the project was challenging given its meticulous craftsmanship that took numerous site visits and extensive research to create the replica. He added the temple is an iconic landmark, so he hoped a lot of tourists would admire their artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want people to see that it is no different from the actual Man Mo Temple. We tried our best to really capture all the details of the temple. We want people to know that there is such a beautiful piece of architecture in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of our artwork is that it captures an angle you can't see fully in real life. It is usually crowded at the temple so you can't see it when it is empty. You also can't see all the little details. You will see the entire structure from a giant's perspective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition will be held in Admiralty from June 21 to July 8.

    Hundreds of Hajj pilgrims feared dead amid heatwave

<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomats from Arab nations on Thursday said hundreds of people had died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced intense high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports were conflicting, but unofficial accounts suggested that at least 500 people had died during the Hajj pilgrimage, with some saying the death toll was likely higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over two million people travel to Saudi Arabia. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage’s history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the high temperatures and intense heat made things especially treacherous for pilgrims this year, with temperatures hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday. (Agencies)

    'HK entrepreneurs in Guangzhou need more help'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Think tanks on Thursday urged Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more assistance to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation said that as of July 2023, there were 52 entrepreneurial bases in Guangzhou for young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau, with about 2,100 start-up projects underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A research team from the two groups visited two bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou and talked to about 10 Hong Kong entrepreneurs working in various industries there, including arts and culture, technology and catering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s assistant research director, Victor Kwok, said some Hong Kong startups there lack knowledge about the business environment and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are gaps that we observe, such as the difference between the skills, knowledge, experiences and the network of the entrepreneurs and the actual requirements of actually having the business to prosper,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok highlighted challenges arising from changes in rules and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We all know comparatively in the mainland, the policy change is sometimes faster than what is observed in Hong Kong, and that could be a challenge, because sometimes you apply for funding and then the policy itself expires before you actually get the funding,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok said a single, easy-to-use government application or website would be beneficial for entrepreneurs to keep themselves updated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incubators in Guangzhou should also be more proactive in assisting startups to apply for funding from the mainland government, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation and coalition also complained that all the entrepreneurial bases offer identical services. They said authorities should differentiate them based on the startups’ development stage or industry type, making it easier for entrepreneurs to connect with the right industry players.

    CUHK develops mRNA drug for nasopharyngeal cancer

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers say the new drug is better than current treatments because it can minimise damage to healthy cells. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758269_1_20240620134352.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists at Chinese University on Thursday said they had developed a new drug that had the potential to cause nasopharyngeal cancer cells to destroy themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drug uses mRNA bio-technology, which acts like a code to activate the death cycle of cancer cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scientists carried out tests on mice and said the results were very promising. They described the drug as a "smart bomb" because it not only targets cancer cells, but also attracts immune cells to help eliminate them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Anne Tsang, one of the researchers, said this new drug is better than current treatments because it could minimise damage to healthy cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All the traditional treatments are mostly systemic. They are chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and so they affect not only the cancer cells, but also the other normal cells," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For our drug, this drug mechanism will only target the cancer cells that are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus. So the normal cells will be safe...and so our human body will feel [many fewer] side effects, and so the patients can have a much better quality of life."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the throat, specifically the part that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It is often called "Canton cancer" because it is more common in southern China.

 Health minister Lo Chung-mau on Thursday said the hardware of all hospitals needs to be of very high quality, to ensure that patients receive proper treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came after a power outage lasting almost an hour at Kwong Wah Hospital on Wednesday night. The redeveloped building was only completed last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff carrying out surgery had to move to another room, while 25 other operations were rescheduled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said there will be a probe into what exactly went wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The quality of construction works and hardware indeed affects our medical services. The Hospital Authority and the hospital will investigate to find out what the problems were technically," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said the problem could be the fault of builders. After the hospital building opened last year, issues with electricity cables were discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not expect a new hospital to have a general power outage problem like that," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that is a systematic problem with the engineering system, or the monitoring system while the building was being constructed, then I believe that's a big issue."
