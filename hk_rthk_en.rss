    Licensed taxi fleet investment 'could top HK$100mn'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licence applications for taxi fleets ended on Friday, with an industry representative saying his group would spend hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in a squad of cabs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The licensed taxi fleet system is part of wider efforts to improve the service quality of point-to-point transport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the government, fleets operating in urban areas should have 300 to 1,000 taxis each, whereas those in the New Territories should have 100 to 350 cabs each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And participating taxis must not be in use for more than three years when a licence is offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities are expected to issue a maximum of five licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yue-ting, from the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, said he believes around eight applications were submitted before the noon deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Wong said he and 12 other operators have joined hands in applying for a licence in the New Territories, in hopes of improving cab services there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the group would have to invest at least HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I estimate that, for the first six months, we would invest HK$3 million to HK$5 million in a taxi-hailing service, plus dash cameras and other systems in the vehicles," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the vehicles, we'll mostly have to replace the existing ones because many of them would have been in use for more than three years when they are licensed. I think more than 80 percent of the taxis no longer fit the requirement. Each taxi will cost about HK$400,000, which means an expenditure of HK$100 million to replace some 300 vehicles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, said he submitted an application for a fleet of about 400 taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said mainland ride-hailing giants Didi Chuxing and Gaode had contacted him on proposing to work together.

    Two giant pandas are the new stars at Madrid zoo

<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to Spain's Madrid Zoo Aquarium were on Thursday introduced to a giant panda couple from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Male Jin Xi and female Zhu Yu, both born in 2020, arrived last month at the zoo following the renewal of its agreement for giant panda protection with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed a smooth quarantine period before making their debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sofia, the former queen of Spain, hosted the official introduction of the three-year-old bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are proud to host this unique species and to contribute to its preservation," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Ambassador to Spain, Yao Jing, highlighted that "the friendly bond" created by the pandas would unite the two peoples and serve as "an important symbol of China-Spain friendship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the debut of the giant panda couple, visitors to the zoo can now participate in educational activities every weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We try to bring information about pandas to the public so they can know pandas better and how we can protect the species," zoo staff Luis Manchado, who is responsible for the educational section, told Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two pandas are set to remain in Spain for the next 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has loaned its treasured bears to overseas zoos over the years as goodwill ambassadors, while also running conservation programmes back home that have seen their status improve from endangered to vulnerable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world.

    Mavs crush T-wolves to book Celtics NBA title showdown

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dallas Mavericks, fueled by 36 points each from Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-103 on Thursday to clinch the Western Conference crown and book an NBA title showdown with the Boston Celtics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Denied a sweep at home on Tuesday, the Mavs left no room for doubt in Minneapolis as they wrapped up the best-of-seven conference finals 4-1 to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since they won the title in 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics will host game one of the championship series on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenian star Doncic and Irving had their way with the league's top-rated defense, Doncic taking the game by the throat in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He scored four of his six three-pointers in the first period, including a bomb from the center court logo, and the Mavs closed the quarter on a 17-1 scoring run to put the Timberwolves on their heels for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irving got going with 15 points in the second quarter as he and Doncic combined for 44 first-half points – four more than the Timberwolves put on the board before halftime, when the Mavs led 69-40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 points each for Minnesota, Towns adding 12 rebounds for the third-seed Timberwolves, who had swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round and stunned the defending champion Denver Nuggets in seven games in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves had been 3-0 in elimination games this post-season, with wins in games six and seven against the Nuggets as well as their victory on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the early damage by Doncic and Dallas' disruptive defense put this one out of reach early and the Mavs grabbed the first double-digit victory of a hard-fought series.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says it will halt tariff concessions from June 15 for some Taiwan products that currently enjoy preferential tariff rates stipulated in the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), in response to the island's trade restrictions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement was made on Friday by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The special rates will be removed from 134 goods, including machine tools and industrial chemicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China in December suspended tariff concessions for some products under the ECFA, but the Finance Ministry said the island has not reciprocated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Taiwan region has unilaterally adopted discriminatory measures such as prohibiting and restricting the export of mainland products, which violates the provisions of the (agreement)," the ministry said. (Xinhua & agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The court ruling on a subversion trial showed that national security risks exist in Hong Kong, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, three national security judges convicted 14 people of conspiring to commit subversion, relating to an opposition plot to take control of the Legislative Council to disrupt government operations. Prosecutors also announced their intention to appeal against the acquittal of two others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said people have to read the court verdict carefully and safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the government will take action against anti-China behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The court ruling reflects that national security risks in Hong Kong truly exist. It's not like what some people said that they were just chanting some slogans and advocating for freedom. Their goal was to destroy Hong Kong, disrupt Hong Kong's constitutional order, paralyse the Hong Kong government, and on a deeper level, use Hong Kong as a base to inhibit the country's development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one fighting for democracy and freedom would hope to paralyse the government or have the streets filled with petrol bombs, Chan said.

 Hong Kong boxer Ruru Yang became WIBA Super Bantamweight champion on Thursday, defeating Thailand's Tanwarat Saengiamjit in Bangkok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old won by unanimous decision after 10 rounds in the Thai capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She adds the previously-vacant WIBA Super Bantamweight belt to her WBC Asia Super Flyweight crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang went into the bout with an undefeated record in five professional fights, with two wins coming by way of TKO.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Should Donald Trump win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755463_1_20240531051916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New York jury convicted Donald Trump on all charges in his hush money case on Thursday in a seismic development barely five months ahead of the election where he seeks to recapture the White House.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic first criminal trial of a former US president ended with the 77-year-old Trump found guilty on each of the 34 charges of falsifying business records to hide a payment meant to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, who is all but certain to appeal, did not immediately react, but sat still, his shoulders dipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conviction thrusts the United States into uncharted political territory but does not bar Trump from a White House run, even in the unlikely event that Judge Juan Merchan sentences him to prison time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict comes just weeks before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is due to receive the party's formal nomination to face Democratic President Joe Biden on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12-member jury deliberated for more than 11 hours over two days at the end of the extraordinary five-week trial held in a drab Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election, when her claim to have had sex with him could have proved politically fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial featured lengthy testimony from the adult performer, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who described to the court in graphic detail what she says was a 2006 sexual encounter with the married Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors successfully laid out a case alleging that the hush money and the illegal covering up of the payment was part of a broader crime to prevent voters from knowing about Trump's behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's defence attorneys had countered that "trying to influence an election" was simply "democracy" and that the former president did nothing wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial has distracted Trump from his campaign to unseat Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he milked the media attention throughout, with daily speeches in front of the cameras outside the courtroom in which he complained about being a political victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identities of the 12 jurors deciding the case were kept secret, a rare practice more often see in cases involving mafia or other violent defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After teasing the prospect for weeks, Trump – who denied ever having sex with Daniels at a 2006 celebrity golf tournament – opted not to testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican, who made his name as a brash real estate mogul before a stunning ascent to the nation's highest office in the 2016 election, now faces prison or, more likely, probation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In theory, he could face up to four years in jail for each count of falsifying business records but legal experts said as a first-time offender he is unlikely to go behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An appeal could take months to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Should he win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself, given that the case was not brought by the federal government but by the state of New York, where only the governor could clear his name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also faces federal and state charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden, and for hoarding secret documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell for a second straight session on Thursday following a downgrade in a US growth report as several large tech shares tumbled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the January to March period, the Commerce Department said, below the 1.6 percent figure published last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Dow member Salesforce plunged nearly 20 percent as the technology company published mixed results and lowered some of its full-year projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other large tech companies followed Salesforce lower. Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon all fell 1.5 percent or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 38,111.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent to 5,235, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 16,737.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses came on the heels of Wednesday's session in which major indices retreated amid worries that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high due to persistent inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about interest rates. We don't see any relief in sight from the Fed," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "There is a growing view that they won't cut at all this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Best Buy soared 13.4 percent despite reporting a 6.1 percent drop in comparable sales as investors were encouraged by commentary suggesting an improvement in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Kohl's plunged 22.9 percent after results missed expectations. The retailer reported a loss of US$27 million. (AFP)

    ANC on track to lose majority after South Africa vote

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Cyril Ramaphosa was all smiles after casting his ballot at a polling station in Soweto. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755457_1_20240531031603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on course to lose its 30-year-old parliamentary majority on Thursday, opening the prospect that the party that defeated apartheid will have to share power for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With a third of votes in Wednesday's election tallied, the ANC was leading but with a score of only 42 percent – well below the 57 percent it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Followed by the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) on 25 percent. The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and former South African president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) were neck and neck on around nine percent each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected in the next three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The broad church of the ANC has taken a substantial knock. This is a shock to the system for the ANC and ultimately will also be a shock to the system for the average South African, who has only known ANC rule since 1994," said political analyst Daniel Silke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It redraws the political boundaries of South Africa and creates a degree of uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If President Cyril Ramaphosa's party is confirmed as dropping below 50 percent, it would force him to seek coalition partners to be re-elected to form a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would be a historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, which was underlined by newspaper headlines on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SA on the cusp of shift in politics," read the front page of daily BusinessDay. "The people have spoken," headlined The Citizen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party remains respected for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule, and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people in power are hopefully going to come down and we will have a new political party," Shaun Manyoni, a 21-year-old student, said in Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa's opponents from both the left and the right came to the polls on Wednesday hoping either to replace the ANC with an opposition alliance or force the party to negotiate a coalition agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Zuma ran this country perfectly ... so let's put him back and let South Africa run again," said Don Naidoo, a middle-aged small business owner from the province's largest city of Durban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voting was marked by hours-long queues in many districts, which in some cases forced polls to remain open well beyond closing time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said a last-minute rush in urban voting and high turnout were to blame for the late finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost all votes had been counted by 3:00 pm on Thursday, but most had yet to be validated, IEC's head Sy Mamabolo told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While, the process was "proceeding well," officials said they expected it would take longer than the usual 24 hours to reach an 80 percent tally, due to delays caused by the new three-ballot system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the ANC gets close to 50 percent it could shore up a majority by allying itself with some of the four dozen smaller and regional parties contesting the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this appeared increasingly unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts were split on who the ANC would prefer as bedfellows and on whether the poor performance threatened Ramaphosa's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His power is gone within the ANC," said analyst Sandile Swana, predicting that the party would patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups led by former ANC figures: firebrand Julius Malema's EFF or Zuma's MK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a major upset, the latter was leading with 43 percent of preferences in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, a key electoral battleground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg said MK was a natural partner for the ANC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have similar policies and similar tendencies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analyst and author Susan Booysen said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma, who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018, was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added. (AFP)

 Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna has ended speculation about his immediate future by signing a new four-year contract on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McKenna, 38, led the Portman Road club to a second successive promotion last season as Ipswich returned to the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That achievement saw him linked with the managerial vacancies at English top-flight rivals Brighton, Chelsea and Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am extremely proud to have signed a new contract with the club," McKenna told Ipswich's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enjoyed incredible success together over the last two seasons and I'm excited to have the opportunity and responsibility of leading this fantastic club into its first season in the Premier League in 22 years." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three main indexes were lower in New York at midday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755452_1_20240531004342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets diverged on Thursday, a day ahead of key inflation indicators that could determine the future direction of interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All the main indexes were lower in New York at midday, following on to Wednesday's slump when shares were hit by concerns that interest rates will not be coming down any time soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US shares were also hit by Salesforce slumping 21 percent after the software company reported disappointing results the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Treasury yields fell back after figures pointed to a slightly weakening US economy, though they were just off their recent highs, indicating expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's second update to first quarter GDP data showed it grew an annually adjusted 1.3 percent, slower than the initial estimate of 1.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders awaited Friday's release of the crucial personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, hoping for signs that prices are being brought under control enough for rates to be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though Treasury yields eased this morning from yesterday's four-week highs, the market appears anxious heading into PCE," said Joe Mazzola, a strategist at Charles Schwab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rising yields snuffed out the tech-led stock market rally yesterday even before Salesforce missed quarterly revenue expectations and sank double-digits," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday also sees the release of the latest eurozone consumer price index, a key release ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on June 6 and which could decide whether the central bank goes ahead and as expected cuts rates by 25 basis points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe's main stock markets closed higher on Thursday, making up some of the losses from the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Thursday, the Sydney stock market closed lower with shares in BHP shedding 1.7 percent after the Australian mining giant ended its US$49-billion takeover bid for British rival Anglo American, whose shares were down five percent in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices fell ahead of this weekend's OPEC meeting over concerns about future demand in China and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Oil is on track for its second straight day of falling prices amid softer US growth data ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting," said Axel Rudolph, Senior Market Analyst at IG.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's parliament gave the final green light to a controversial amnesty bill for Catalan separatists on Thursday, paving the way for the return of their figurehead Carles Puigdemont after years of self-imposed exile.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislation seeks to draw a line under years of efforts to prosecute those involved in the botched 2017 Catalan independence bid that triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The text, which has been resolutely opposed by Spain's right and far-right opposition, passed by 177 votes in favour to 172 votes against in the 350-seat parliament. One person was absent from the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing the amnesty is a key moment for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as it was a demand made by separatist parties in exchange for their parliamentary support to allow him to serve a new term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, Spain's lower house of parliament passed the bill, which grants an amnesty to hundreds of separatists involved in Catalonia's failed 2017 independence bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It then went to the Senate upper house, which is dominated by the right-wing opposition, where it was symbolically vetoed – as the Senate cannot block a bill, but only propose amendments – before returning to the lower house on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a rowdy two-and-a-half hour debate during which the Speaker was forced to call order several times due to the insults traded on the floor, the bill passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will now be up to individual judges to decide whether the amnesty applies to their cases. They have two months to raise issues with the Constitutional Court or the European justice system which could delay the law's implementation for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest beneficiary will be Puigdemont – the former Catalan leader who led the bid then fled Spain to avoid prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His hardline separatist JxCat and its moderate rival ERC both demanded the amnesty in return for their votes in November that let Sanchez secure another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What opened that door was Spain's inconclusive July 2023 election, which was won by the right-wing Popular Party (PP) but without enough parliamentary support to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With JxCat cast as kingmaker, Sanchez won them over with the promise of an amnesty and returned to office, in a move sparking fierce and unrelenting opposition from the PP and the far-right Vox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have drawn thousands onto the streets in mass protests against the bill that at times turned violent, notably around the Socialists' Madrid headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a PP spokesman said that even after it passes, the party would do everything to "overturn" the law, whether through appeals to the Constitutional Court or "social pressure" on the street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surveys suggest Spaniards are divided over the amnesty, even Sanchez's own Socialists and their supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the outcome of Catalonia's regional election on May 12, in which the Socialists won a clear victory, has shifted the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The separatists lost their absolute majority in the Catalan parliament after 10 years in power, suggesting the focus has shifted away from independence, vindicating Sanchez's strategy of seeking to defuse tensions around the 2017 crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader of the Socialist Party's Catalan branch, Salvador Illa, is hoping to lead the region's new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results show that Catalonia has chosen "the path of forgiveness, giving up any kind of resentment," Sanchez said in Barcelona last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Puigdemont, whose party increased support during the vote and has said he wants to lead a minority separatist administration, is hoping to be home back in time to see a new Catalan government take office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the date has not yet been set, it is expected to take place by June 25 at the latest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is unclear whether that will be possible, given the two month time span for the courts to enact the legislation, which involves releasing those behind bars and cancelling outstanding arrest warrants, including the one for Puigdemont. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull has purchased a minority stake in Leeds United and will become the English second-tier football club's main shirt sponsor next season, it was announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The global drinks brand, best known in sport as the backer of the world champion Formula One team, are already involved with football clubs RB Leipzig, Red Bull Salzburg and New York Red Bulls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thrilled that Red Bull is joining us to build a bright future for Leeds United and shares our deep respect for this truly special club," said United chairman Paraag Marathe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As chairman, our consortium of investment partners will be invaluable to me as we approach this important moment for the club, now and into the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Red Bull's addition is a historic milestone that will further empower the club to reach its full competitive potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds will spend a second consecutive season back in the Championship after losing to Southampton in last Sunday's play-off final at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull chief executive of corporate projects and investments Oliver Mintzlaff said the company hoped to help the Yorkshire club back into the top flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ambition to bring Leeds United back to the Premier League and establish themselves in the best football league in the world fits very well with Red Bull." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and his wife Roh So-young. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755442_1_20240530224208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of South Korea's sprawling SK Group was ordered by a court on Thursday to pay his wife US$1 billion in cash in the country's largest divorce settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court ordered Chey Tae-won to pay Roh So-young, the daughter of former president Roh Tae-woo, 1.38 trillion won as a settlement, court documents showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount was a significant increase from an earlier lower court ruling of 66.5 billion won and takes into account the contributions Roh So-young and her father made to Chey's success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SK Group runs businesses that include South Korea's leading mobile carrier and also controls SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chip maker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was reasonable to rule that, as his wife, Roh played a role in increasing the value of SK Group and Chey's business activity," the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey married Roh So-young in 1988 but they have been separated for years. She appealed against the original settlement amount awarded in 2022, several years after Chey filed for divorce in what has become an acrimonious case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the new settlement also took into account the emotional suffering Roh So-young endured due to Chey's extramarital affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey has a child with his new partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Chey "is not showing any signs of remorse for his foul behaviour in the course of the trial... nor respect for monogamy," ordering him to pay the settlement in cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's net wealth was assessed by the court to be around four trillion won, meaning Roh So-young will take 35 percent of it in the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His legal team said they would lodge an appeal against the latest ruling, claiming the court had "taken Roh's one-sided claim as factual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court said Roh Tae-woo also helped Chey's business flourish during his five years as president from 1988, easing regulatory hurdles for SK's late former chairman Chey Jong-hyon, Chey Tae-won's father.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former president Roh Tae-woo played the role of a protective shield for ex-chairman Chey Jong-hyon" when the late businessman was trying to tap into the mobile carrier business, the court said, giving "intangible help" to the family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's lawyers disagreed, saying SK Group had been under pressure from the Roh government and had "provided various financial contributions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will set things straight through the appeal," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former general, Roh Tae-woo was elected to the presidency in 1987 polls that were South Korea's first free and fair election in more than a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had earlier helped his military academy friend Chun Doo-hwan stage a military coup and take over as a dictator. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Thursday said it strongly disapproves of, and condemns all baseless allegations by the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and the European Union (EU) against the city’s homegrown national security law as well as law enforcement action taken by the police’s National Security Department.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The police made seven arrests on Tuesday and Wednesday on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seven were accused of being responsible for seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CECC and EU had described the arrests as a violation of human rights and an attempt to stifle freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a statement published on Thursday, authorities said their claims simply do not stand up to the facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation,” the statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Offences in connection with seditious intention are very serious crimes, and no jurisdictions, including the US and those from the EU, will watch with folded arms acts and activities that endanger national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security, adding that it will not hinder legitimate expression of opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against acts and activities endangering national security. Only invaders who want to intrude into our home to plunder and loot should be worried by the Ordinance,” the statement added.

 Police said five people were arrested near West Kowloon Court on Thursday for alleged disorderly conduct in public places
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said four people, aged between 32 and 68, failed to follow instructions when they entered the court building. They also ignored officers' verbal warnings and chanted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force added that they arrested another 32-year-old man after he chanted inside the court area and refused to cooperate with officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five suspects are detained on suspicion of engaging in disorderly conduct in a public place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police reminded members of the public to abide by the law and express their views in a peaceful and orderly manner, without undermining national and public security.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday hit out against foreign criticism of the landmark court ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in the capital, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Beijing strenuously opposes attempts by foreign countries to use this case to interfere in China’s internal affairs and smear Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one can engage in unlawful activities in the name of democracy and then try to escape legal sanctions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokeswoman added that the central government firmly supports the SAR’s law enforcement and judicial authorities in fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that violated national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came after the United States, European Union and Australia described the trial as being "politically motivated", and called for those convicted to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  14 people were convicted earlier in the day of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law, after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by plotting to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two others were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  31 other defendants, meanwhile, had already pleaded guilty in the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said the court ruling on a national security trial confirmed there was a conspiracy to commit subversion, which also showed the seriousness of the case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Lee said the judgement handed down by a three-judge panel showed there was a conspiracy to subvert state power and to destroy and overthrow the existing political system and structure established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the convictions of 45 of the 47 defendants showed the scale and severity of the plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 16 who pleaded not guilty, 14 were convicted of conspiring to commit subversion and two were acquitted. Thirty-one others pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that the Department of Justice had indicated its intention to appeal against the acquittals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR is duty-bound to safeguard national security, and is determined to fight any acts that compromise this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the subversion saga had harmed Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no winner out of this case. This is a very sad story that some Hong Kong people tried to conduct subversion of Hong Kong. I think it is good that we were able to interdict the plot so that the Hong Kong citizens will not suffer and Hong Kong will now resume to a normal state," he told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 and said it would remain in effect until at least 6am on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a tropical cyclone located about 800 kilometres from Hong Kong could affect the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad area of low pressure in the South China Sea has become a tropical depression, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said strong winds were not expected to have a significant impact on the region yet, but the tropical depression could move closer to the coast and strengthen slightly during Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would assess the need to issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 based on the storm's intensity, as well as local wind conditions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Thursday announced its intention to appeal against the acquittal of two of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were among 16 defendants who pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a verdict delivered on Thursday morning, the judges said they were not sure if Lau and Lee had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the lunch break, Director of Public Prosecutions Maggie Yang told the court that the Department of Justice intends to appeal using the amended Criminal Procedure Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She requested that the pair be kept on bail, pending a decision on the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee's defence counsel argued against that, saying his client should be a "free man" unless the court grants the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-judge panel decided to extend the bail of Lau and Lee. They are now required to report to police on a monthly basis, instead of twice every week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also said mitigation hearings for those convicted are scheduled for June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the media, chief superintendent Steve Li from the police's National Security Department welcomed the conviction of 14 defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the judgement, you can see that the court regarded this as a very serious case. This is a very illicit plot... The ultimate goal is to paralyse the government," he said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Iran opens a five-day registration period for hopefuls wanting to run in the June 28 presidential election. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755385_1_20240530161041.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran opened a five-day registration period on Thursday for hopefuls wanting to run in the June 28 presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier this month with seven others.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The election comes as Iran grapples with the aftermath of the May 19 crash, as well as heightened tensions with Israel and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The period would see those between the ages of 40 to 75 with at least a master's degree register as potential candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All candidates ultimately must be approved by Iran's 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That panel has never accepted a woman nor anyone calling for radical change within the country's governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is unlear who will run. The country’s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front-runner, because he's already been seen meeting with Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day registration period will close on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guardian Council is expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June. (AP)

 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 at 5.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea will soon develop into a tropical depression. It is expected to gradually move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory added that there will be squally showers and thunderstorms in the coming days, while winds offshore and on high ground will strengthen.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electronic queuing systems for taxis have been brought in at the arrival hall to reduce queues during extreme weather, the Airport Authority said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven Yiu, the executive director of airport operations, said the system was introduced in March this year after people had to queue for hours last year during a typhoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a mobile phone notification or the airport's information board would now tell passengers when their taxi was ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to avoid a long queuing for prolonged-waiting passengers. For example, if the typhoon lasts three to four hours, we don't let the passengers keep queuing for long periods of time, so we give them some sort of queuing number so they can stay in the restaurant and also rest until being called forward to the taxi station," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We created a resting area, actually it is a large area with over 500 chairs, with Wifi [and a] charging facility. We will also distribute water, biscuits to them, and also some blankets as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority hopes to make passengers feel comfortable, especially when taxis and Airport Express trains can't operate under Typhoon Signal No 9.

    Judges cite intention in acquitting two defendants

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three judges presiding over a subversion trial centred on an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations said in their ruling on Thursday that two of the defendants were acquitted because they were not sure if the pair had the intention to subvert state power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the judgement, former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun never advocated vetoing government budgets in the election forum they had attended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution argued during the trial that the suspects planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure to be introduced by the government, had they become Legco members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, the judges said although Lau's name appeared on a declaration of poll candidates, they were not sure if he had signed it himself or authorised someone to sign it on his behalf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the "Inked without Regret" declaration agreed to use the vetoing power of lawmakers to force the chief executive to respond to the five demands of protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a fact that [Lau] did not post the [declaration] on his Facebook page and he did not make use of the [declaration] in his electioneering work," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said although the now-disbanded Civic Party, which Lee belonged to, endorsed the declaration, he was not yet a candidate at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also noted that Lee had asked his election team to come up with a new pamphlet that did not mention the five demands after looking at the national security law, which took effect in June 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released after the verdict at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still other defendants in this case, warranting our concern and even love," Lau told reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's any star in this case, this judgement should be the star. It sets the jurisprudence, reasoning, logic, perspectives of our judges. Please study it. This is more important than any single individual of this case. This is part of our rule of law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the first thing he'd like to do was to have a meal with his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel calm, as I have always been... Thank you to everyone who have been concerned about us and expressing your care. We all can feel that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there is a tendency for the prosecution to apply for an appeal, so I cannot make any comment on this case at this moment."

    Use of force not necessary for subversion, court finds
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The court ruled that those who intentionally commit an act that contravenes the national security law with the intent to subvert state power don't have to use force or know they're breaching the law to be found guilty." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755349_1_20240530121750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landmark ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date has set out that those who plot to subvert state power need not use force or employ criminal means to be found guilty of breaching the national security law (NSL), nor do they need to know that their tactics were unlawful.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan laid out their reasoning in a 319-page judgement, which found 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion while acquitting two. Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges concluded that those convicted had taken part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government by unlawful means with a view to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court found that they had planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure request by the government if they win a majority in the Legislative Council election in 2020, to compel the chief executive to accede to demands made by anti-government protesters or be forced to dissolve the legislature and resign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges rejected arguments by defence lawyers that "unlawful means" necessitates the use or threat of force; that guilty parties must know that what they were doing was illegal; and that Legco members who veto government budgets are merely exercising their constitutional duty instead of breaking the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ruling, the judges noted that the NSL was drafted with the understanding that national security in the city could be undermined not only by force, but also by non-violent actions such as advocating Hong Kong's independence, inciting public hatred, and paralysing the work of the government and legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said limiting "unlawful means" to acts of force would be such a narrow interpretation that "would be absurd and illogical and defeat the purpose of the NSL".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also swept aside defence arguments that "other unlawful means" should only include criminal acts, saying it’s “inconceivable that acts or activities by whatever forms and methods with a view to subverting the state power could be considered to be acceptable or tolerable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moreover, they ruled that the defendants did not have to be aware that they were breaching the law at the time of the offence, so long as the accused had intentionally committed an unlawful act with a view to subverting state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Therefore, it was irrelevant to the issue of guilt that the accused acted with a mistaken belief that his or her means was lawful; to hold otherwise would go against the purpose of the NSL,” the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the judges agreed that legislators should not automatically approve government budgets, any plan to indiscriminately veto such budgets in an attempt to force the government to accept political demands would, they concluded, constitute an abuse of power that contravenes both the Basic Law and the NSL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also dismissed defence claims that the offence wasn’t clearly defined because the law doesn’t provide specific definitions for "subversion" or "state power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said it was obvious that all the powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ultimately came from the Constitution and the Central People's Government, and concluded that "state power" refers to those wielded by the SAR government, including the various duties and functions it performs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a dictionary definition of "subversion", the judges ruled that “a serious interference in, disruption or undermining of the performance of duties and functions in accordance with the law by the body of power of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region… could amount to an act ‘subverting the State power’.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, they found that 14 defendants had knowingly participated in the plot, with the intention of subverting state power, and therefore found them guilty.

    FS hopes for stronger ties between China, US bay areas

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has told the business community in Berkeley, California that he hopes there will be further financial and technological exchanges between the state's bay area and the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and the University of Hong Kong both signed a memorandum of understanding with a California-based climate institute to cooperate in areas such as talent exchanges, green fintech and carbon market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope, too, that we can encourage financial and technological exchanges. The global gap for green funding and technology is enormous, measured in trillions of US dollars. Let's turn this need into opportunities,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to say that Hong Kong is a great place to do business in Asia, being the "super connector" between China and the rest of the world, and invited US businesses to pay a visit to the SAR to see what is on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also told attendees at a climate event that Hong Kong is committed to a greener future and that the SAR plans to reach carbon neutrality in the coming decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are adopting a four-pronged strategy to reach neutrality: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Indeed, we were among the first cities in Asia to take action against climate change… Our carbon emissions peaked in 2014 and have shown a general downward trend since.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military officials on Thursday said North Korea fired a barrage of suspected ballistic missiles toward its eastern sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The missile launch comes days after its attempt to put a military reconnaissance satellite into orbit ended in failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the North firing around 10 projectiles that appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles from an area near its capital, Pyongyang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the suspected missiles flew around 350 kilometres before landing in waters off the North’s eastern coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the South Korean military had increased surveillance and shared its information with the United States and Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan’s coast guard issued a maritime safety advisory over the North Korean launches
  <br/>
  and urged ships to exercise caution if they find any fallen objects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters the suspected missiles were believed to have landed in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone and there were no immediate reports of damages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Tokyo “strongly condemns” the launches, which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North. (AP)

 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 if a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea develops into a tropical depression.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the low-pressure area is still loosely organised but may intensify. It is expected to move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that there will be showers, thunderstorms and strong winds in the coming days, while offshore winds will also strengthen.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The group in charge of promoting patriotic education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee on Thursday said it is going to hold design contests in which participants create mascots and logos that reflect the theme of "love our country, love Hong Kong, and love our community."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The competitions would be held in separate primary, secondary, and tertiary divisions. The winning design could be used in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners and the first and second runner-ups would also receive annual passes to the Hong Kong Palace Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registration for the competition starts today and will close on July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's convenor, Starry Lee, said all schools in the SAR would be invited to join the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have designed a theme that is ‘to love our motherland, to love Hong Kong and to love the community’. We need a logo or symbol to represent this main theme. We will issue a letter to all schools in the community, including universities, secondary and primary schools, to invite all schools to join and participate in this competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hopefully, we can find some very symbolic design so that we can use in other part of our activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while participation is voluntary, she expects a lot of students would join the contests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned 'primary election' organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two others – former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun – were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those convicted in the subversion case were Gordon Ng, Tat Cheng, Clarisse Yeung, Michael Pang, Kalvin Ho, Helena Wong, Sze Tak-loy, Gwyneth Ho, Raymond Chan, Owen Chow, Lam Cheuk-ting, Leung Kwok-hung, Ricky Or and Winnie Yu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were remanded in custody, pending sentencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict was handed down by three national security judges in a hearing at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.

 Hong Kong stocks opened with another loss on Thursday morning.

  <br/>
  This followed a retreat on Wall Street that came on the back of rising US Treasury yields and worries about whether the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this year.

    Robots help with spine surgery at Queen Mary Hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Over the past eight months, robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at the hospital. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755312_1_20240530094044.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at Queen Mary Hospital since October. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say the robot can help surgeons be more precise and accurate when placing screws, and thus reduce the risk of complications and the need for more surgery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jason Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong's medical school, led the research team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say there are a couple of aspects that it improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First it of course increases patient safety. So in the past when we are doing the surgeries, where we insert the screws, they are all done by free hand, meaning that it is up to the surgeons' experience to identify where the correct position is for the screws...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secondly, it helps the surgeon with the overall process of the surgery. Surgeons no longer need to be completely concentrated to put screws in accurately. They can actually put their major part of the concentration into more risky procedures, such as decompression of the nerves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Cheung said surgeons would still remain in overall control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So even to this day when I am using the robot, despite it guiding me, I will still always check whether the track of the screws are correct or not. So I will always double-check myself by feel, perhaps an X-ray just to confirm whether everything is accurate," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Cheung said the robot didn't just help with inserting the screws. He said, prior to surgery, surgeons would take a CT scan from the patient and plan where to put the screws. The system would then match this with the plan and guide the surgeon.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police keep a heavy presence outside West Kowloon Court ahead of a verdict on 16 opposition figures. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=5&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755319_1_20240530093837.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court is set to begin delivering a verdict on whether 16 opposition figures breached the national security law by participating in an unofficial legislative primary election four years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Queues formed outside the West Kowloon Court where the hearing is held amid tightened security and a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixteen defendants who have pleaded not guilty are expecting to hear their fate after a subversion trial lasting 118 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, they could face up to life in prison although sentencing is expected later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among the 47 politicians and activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities alleged that an unofficial Legco primary election in July 2020 was a subversive attempt by the opposition camp to win a majority in Legco and paralyse the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 16 who stood trial include former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, and journalist-turned-activist Gwyneth Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was centred on whether they conspired to subvert state power by planning to indiscriminately vote down the budget and force the then-Chief Executive to resign through their participation in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others, including former legal scholar Benny Tai and ex-student activist Joshua Wong, pleaded guilty to their charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judiciary has set aside more than 400 seats for the public to hear the verdict on Thursday - the largest national security case to date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three national security judges - Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan - presided over the jury-free trial.

 Siobhan Haughey won her fourth gold medal of the Mare Nostrum Swim Tour on Wednesday, this one coming in the 100m freestyle event on Day 1 in Barcelona.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Competing in her only discipline on the opening day, a time of 55.45 seconds was enough to easily see the 26-year-old through the preliminary heats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong swimmer then improved her time to 52.76 in the final, touching the wall 1.11 seconds ahead of Swedish swimmer Michelle Coleman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took gold in the 100m breaststroke, 200m freestyle and 100m freestyle at the Tour's opening leg in the French town of Canet-en-Roussillon.

    Prosecutors drop assault charges against Scheffler

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prosecutors in Kentucky on Wednesday dropped all charges against top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler, who was arrested after allegedly ignoring police at a traffic stop outside the US PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, 27, was handcuffed and led away by officers in the pre-dawn incident on May 17, before having his mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit and then returning from jail to the Valhalla course and teeing off for his second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler allegedly drove onto a curb near the course entrance after police set up a traffic stop due to a separate road accident in which a local man working at the tournament had been killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police report said Scheffler had disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging to the ground police officer Bryan Gillis, who was hospitalized with bruising and swelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell lodged a motion in court to dismiss all charges against Scheffler and the judge agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court that the evidence against Scheffler did not meet the standard of probable cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on the totality of the evidence my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr Scheffler," O'Connell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler had been charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Steve Romines denied any wrongdoing, adding Scheffler was driving a marked player's vehicle when he received conflicting signals from police officers at the traffic control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romines had stressed that his client would fight the charges and was "not interested in any sort of settlement negotiations or anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the morning of his arrest, world number-one Scheffler released a statement saying "there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court in Louisville that Scheffler's claim of misunderstanding "is corroborated by the evidence." (AFP)

    Swiatek survives Osaka classic, Alcaraz goes through

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek escaped from match point down against Naomi Osaka to reach the French Open third round on Wednesday, while Carlos Alcaraz overcame a scare of his own as persistent rain caused widespread disruption to the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swiatek outlasted fellow four-time Grand Slam winner Osaka 7-6 [7/1], 1-6, 7-5 in a breathtaking second-round clash, livening a gloomy day in which 23 singles matches were postponed until Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Swiatek won the last five games of the match to keep her bid for a third successive Roland Garros title on track. Justine Henin was the last woman to achieve the feat in 2005-07.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Osaka, appearing at only a second Grand Slam since giving birth to her daughter last July, was on the cusp of her biggest win since returning to tennis at the start of the year but took a philosophical view to an agonising defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three break points eluded Swiatek to start the deciding set and Osaka's clean hitting quickly had her opponent again on the back foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Osaka blasted a backhand winner to break for a 2-0 advantage before demonstrating her resolve once more to save another five break points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek fended off a break opportunity to stay in touch at 2-4, but she looked doomed when Osaka brought up match point three games later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A terrific return kept her alive and a loose backhand from Osaka handed Swiatek a break to get back to 4-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a tough hold, Swiatek broke again to move 6-5 in front before holding her nerve to wrap up victory after nearly three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion and third seed Coco Gauff defeated Slovenia's Tamara Zidansek 6-3, 6-4, while eighth seed Ons Jabeur overcame Colombia's Camila Osorio in three sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz shook off a third-set blip against world number 176 Jesper de Jong before the Spaniard came through 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 under the roof on Court Philippe Chatrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the men's draw were Second seed Jannik Sinner, Sixth seed Andrey Rublev and former French Open finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas. (AFP)

    Interest rate fears take shine off US markets

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Wednesday as rising Treasury bond yields prompted a wave of selling after recent records.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Now that the (first-quarter earnings) period is essentially over, inflation and interest rates are front of mind," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, noting that the Dow has pulled back after topping 40,000 earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 percent on the day to 38,441.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.7 percent to 5,266, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6 percent to 16,920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have attributed the rise in Treasury yields partly to commentary from US Federal Reserve officials warning that elevated inflation could keep interest rates high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market observers have also cited disappointing demand for US Treasury bonds as a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Fed's latest "beige book" of economic conditions pointed to a somewhat gloomier outlook, although economic activity remained positive from early April to mid-May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Marathon Oil shot up 8.4 percent after it agreed to be acquired by ConocoPhillips in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ConocoPhillips declined 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Airlines sank 13.5 percent after it lowered its profit outlook, citing weaker demand and a troubled booking system upgrade. (AFP)

    Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula hit by fresh eruption

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new volcano erupted on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland on Wednesday, spewing red-hot lava into the air shortly after authorities evacuated the nearby town of Grindavik.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A large white cloud of smoke could be seen, with orange lava fountains bubbling out of a crack in the ground near Sundhnukagigar, north of Grindavik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption was the fifth in six months on the Reykjanes peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two hours after the start of the eruption, lava was flowing less than a kilometre from a defensive barrier protecting the fishing village of Grindavik, the barrier itself located about another kilometre from the northern tip of the town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the 4,000 residents had evacuated Grindavik in November, prior to a December eruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lava flowed into the town's streets during another eruption in January, engulfing three homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the large share of those who were in the town on Wednesday -- for work or visits -- left immediately, a few die-hard residents refused to leave, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite recommendations from response teams to leave the town, three residents remain in Grindavik. Such actions are not advisable," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nearby Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, Iceland's biggest tourist attraction known for its turquoise waters, said it had evacuated its facilities on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maia Biegatch, a 28-year-old French tourist, had just arrived at the Blue Lagoon when the eruption occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We received alerts on our phones telling us to 'evacuate, evacuate', so we turned back," she told AFP. "It was a total surprise."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption was, however, not expected to disrupt air traffic, with the international airport Keflavik "open and operating in the usual way", airport operator Isavia said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The eruption cloud reached an altitude of about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) at the beginning of the eruption" and the length of the fissure was estimated at over one kilometre, the Iceland Meteorological Office said shortly after the eruption began at 12:46 pm (1246 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 90 minutes later, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management said the fissure had extended to 3.4 kilometres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lava flow was heavy, estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000 cubic metres per second, the IMO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption came almost three weeks after the end of a previous eruption that had been ongoing since March 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past six months, volcanoes have erupted on the peninsula in December, January, February and March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMO had reported "intense earthquake activity" prior to Wednesday's eruption, with "about 400 earthquakes" measured in the past seven days near the Sundhnukagigar crater row. (AFP)

    BHP abandons bid for Anglo American

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's BHP announced on Wednesday that it has walked away from a proposed US$49-billion takeover of British rival Anglo American that would have created a copper titan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BHP said in a statement that it will not make a firm offer for Anglo American, ending a six-week saga and scrapping its gigantic proposal just before a key Wednesday deadline which its UK rival had refused to extend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A core part of BHP's plan was splitting off Anglo's platinum holdings in South Africa, a politically sensitive move that stirred government opposition ahead of the country's general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's offer had also proposed Anglo American hiving off its iron ore production activities in South Africa under plans to focus on copper, demand for which is booming over its use in green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP will not be making a firm offer for Anglo American," BHP chief executive Mike Henry said in a statement bringing an end to their efforts, which had seen the Australian company twice raise its initial proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we believed that our proposal for Anglo American was a compelling opportunity to effectively grow the pie of value for both sets of shareholders, we were unable to reach agreement with Anglo American on our specific views in respect of South African regulatory risk and cost."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP remained confident however that its plan "was the most effective structure to deliver value for Anglo American shareholders" and could have "obtained all required regulatory approvals, including in South Africa", he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-listed giant had rejected a third offer from BHP last week, worth 38.6 billion pounds, but agreed to keep talks alive for seven more days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to BHP's overtures, Anglo had recently announced it would offload its coal, diamond and platinum businesses to focus on critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Wednesday, Anglo American had rejected BHP's request to extend talks over its vast proposal beyond a 1600 GMT deadline for it to either make a concrete offer or abandon the bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said its board had unanimously concluded that there was "no basis for a further extension" for BHP to explore its proposal, adding that there were "fundamental concerns" over the bid structure and value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offer "includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure", Anglo American argued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the deadline, BHP -- which is listed in London and Sydney -- had made a last-ditch attempt to mollify concerns and keep its bid alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP believes that its proposal will contribute to South Africa and allow the benefits of South African mining to be shared with more South African stakeholders," the company had insisted in its previous statement as it requested a further deadline extension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any deal between two of the world's largest resources companies would have fundamentally reshaped the sector, with far-reaching consequences for commodities markets and the global energy transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's interest was largely stoked by its hunger to secure a reliable copper supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anglo American's South American copper holdings include four of the largest copper mines in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An electrical conductor used in wiring, the metal is seen as a bedrock of emerging clean-energy industries -- a crucial component to manufacture solar panels, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also widely regarded as vital for the development of cutting-edge AI technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copper prices have increased about 400 percent in the past quarter of a century, and broke US$10,000 a tonne in April for the first time in two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boom has already prompted a wave of investment, with BHP snapping up Australian copper producer OZ Minerals for more than US$6 billion last year. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said the panel will foster a European AI ecosystem that's "innovative, competitive and respectful of EU rules and values". File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755276_1_20240530005254.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Wednesday announced the creation of an "AI Office" of tech experts, lawyers and economists to regulate artificial intelligence under a sweeping new law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU this year approved the world's first comprehensive rules to govern AI, especially powerful systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT after long, intense negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First proposed in 2021, the bloc raced to get the law in the books after ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, leaving users stunned by its ability to churn out coherent text including poems within seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The AI Office aims at enabling the future development, deployment and use of AI in a way that fosters societal and economic benefits and innovation, while mitigating risks," the European Commission said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 140-member AI Office will be established within the commission, which is the EU's executive arm and also acts as the bloc's powerful tech regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Office will foster a European AI ecosystem that is innovative, competitive and respectful of EU rules and values," the EU's top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's law known as the "AI Act" has tougher rules for general-purpose AI systems such as ChatGPT and takes a risk-based approach to the technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher the risk to Europeans' rights or health, for example, the greater the systems' obligations to protect individuals from harms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with developers and a scientific community, the office will evaluate and test general purpose AI to ensure that AI serves us as humans and upholds our European values," commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies will have to comply with the EU's law by 2026, but rules covering AI models like ChatGPT will apply 12 months after the law becomes official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's announcement came on the same day that EU auditors criticised the commission for failing to sufficiently invest in AI to achieve the bloc's ambitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, stronger governance and more -- and better targeted -- public and private investment in the EU will be paramount if the EU is to achieve its AI ambitions," the bloc's spending watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the commission defended the bloc's record and said it was investing more than one billion euros (US$1.1 billion) annually in AI research projects under different schemes. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US energy giant ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday it will acquire competitor Marathon Oil in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion, including US$5.4 billion in debt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deal, the latest in a series of major acquisitions in the US oil sector, will enable ConocoPhillips to strengthen its position in shale oil and gas-rich regions such as the Bakken Basin in the northern United States and the Permian Basin in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acquisition "further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading US unconventional position," ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer Ryan Lance said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the company sees "significant synergy potential" in the merger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marathon Oil chief Lee Tillman said it was a "proud moment to look back on what we achieved," and that ConocoPhillips was "the right home to build on that legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, gives Marathon Oil shareholders 0.255 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each share of Marathon Oil common stock. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Geneva-based International Labour Organization expects unemployment to stay at 4.9 percent in 2025, but warned that "inequalities in labour markets persist". File photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755273_1_20240530002708.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global unemployment is set to fall slightly this year, a United Nations agency said on Wednesday, reversing its previous prediction of a rise while warning of "slow progress" on tackling inequalities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Labour Organization (ILO) expects a global unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in 2024, after originally forecasting unemployment would rise to 5.2 percent this year from 5 percent in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a report, the Geneva-based UN agency forecasts that the rate will stay at 4.9 percent in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the ILO cautioned that "inequalities in labour markets persist, with women in low-income countries particularly affected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report found that 183 million people meet the definition of unemployed, meaning they are actively looking for work and are immediately available. But the number of people without a job who wanted to work stood at 402 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency also said women were more likely to be unwillingly out of work and disproportionately affected by a lack of opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women in low-income countries were especially hard-hit, with 22.8 percent who wanted a job not in work, compared with 15.3 percent for men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For high-income countries, the rate stood at 9.7 percent for women and 7.3 percent for men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report also warned that these differences were just the "tip of the iceberg" as women were much more likely than men to have left the labour force altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worldwide, the report estimated that 45.6 percent of women of working age were employed in 2024. For men, the figure was 69.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite our efforts to reduce global inequalities, the labour market remains an uneven playing field," ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo is quoted as saying in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To achieve a sustainable recovery whose benefits are shared by all... we must place inclusion and social justice at the core of our policies and institutions," Houngbo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ILO is the oldest specialised UN agency and brings together employers, unions and governments from around the world. (AFP)

    Two giant pandas to head to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, in 2022. Two other giant pandas are heading to Washington's National Zoo later in the year. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755269_1_20240529222502.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will return giant pandas to Washington's National Zoo by the end of the year, US First Lady Jill Biden and officials said on Wednesday in a surprise announcement signalling a new era of panda diplomacy between the two superpowers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We are excited for children near and far to once again enjoy the giant pandas' adorable and joyful adventures at our @NationalZoo," the first lady posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing will send a new pair called Bao Li and Qing Bao under a 10-year breeding and research agreement, the zoo said in a statement, hailing a "historic moment" that demonstrated the benefits of its partnership with Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, DC," said Brandie Smith of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, only a handful of the iconic black and white bears remain in the US, with three having left the national zoo in Washington six months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Xi Jinping said after meeting President Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would be happy to have more bamboo-chewing bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been using so-called "panda diplomacy" since 1972, when the first animals were sent to the United States as a gift, following then-president Richard Nixon's historic visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strained relations between the rival superpowers in recent years have led Beijing to call some of the pandas back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three giant pandas at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington – Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who arrived in 2000, and their three-year-old cub Xiao Qi Ji ("Little Miracle" in English) – flew back on a cargo plane to China in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The currently last remaining pandas in the US, at a zoo in the southern city of Atlanta, are due to return to China later this year, although China announced plans in February to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Egypt on Wednesday signed agreements deepening their cooperation during President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's visit to Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping and his Egyptian counterpart witnessed the signing in a ceremony that coincided with the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China and Egypt discussed bilateral relations and bringing stability to the Middle East in light of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a statement released by the Egyptian presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused a large number of innocent Palestinian civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation in Gaza is extremely severe. China is deeply pained," Xi told el-Sisi, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The top priority task now is an immediate ceasefire, in order to avoid spillover of conflict, impact on regional peace and stability, and so as to prevent a more serious humanitarian crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that China is ready to work with Egypt to continue to assist the people of Gaza "and push for an early, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, along with Qatar and the United States, have been engaged for months in talks aimed at securing a lasting truce between Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreements signed between Beijing and Cairo on Wednesday include collaboration in the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state projects, including the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital east of Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investments between the two countries amounted to around US$14 billion in 2023, compared to US$16.6 billion in 2022, according to the latest data released by Egypt’s statistics agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is hosting el-Sisi and several other Arab leaders in Beijing this week, with talks aimed at deepening consensus between Beijing and the Arab countries. (Agencies)

 National security police on Wednesday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested on Tuesday and linked to seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that a 53-year-old woman arrested on Wednesday is the wife of one of those taken into custody the day before.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Wednesday said it arrested 12 people, including footballers and coaches, for alleged match-fixing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the head coach, a midfielder and a goalkeeper of a football team in the Hong Kong Premier League were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also taken into custody were a coach and five players from two teams in the third-tier Second Division. Three betting agents were arrested as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC did not name the suspects or their clubs, citing an ongoing investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged offences took place over three seasons, beginning with the 2021 campaign, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matthew Chang, a principal investigator with the ICAC, said the coaches allegedly communicated with players with signals during the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They would give some secret signals during the match if they can recruit some players in the same team, like moving their head or using their body language, gestures, to show that at which specific times the involved players have to do something, like to keep going to score or just stop to defend,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said each player could get up to tens of thousands of dollars for each match fixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also believed that some of those arrested placed bets in illegal gambling for gains, with the amount of bets topping HK$1 million in one season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said the suspects have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Football Association of Hong Kong, China said it will fully assist the ICAC in the investigation, stressing that it has "zero tolerance" towards football corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the association said if the allegations are proven true, it will severely punish the clubs, players and coaches involved by revoking their memberships and imposing lifetime suspensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Premier League expressed regret over the incident, adding that it will work with the football association to create a fair and clean football industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said it will not tolerate illegal acts. The bureau said it will urge the local football association to work with ICAC and improve the anti-corruption awareness of football clubs.

    South African general election gets underway

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africans began voting on Wednesday in the most competitive election since the end of apartheid, with opinion polls suggesting the African National Congress (ANC) would lose its parliamentary majority after 30 years in government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Then led by Nelson Mandela, the ANC swept to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election in 1994 and won a majority in national elections held every five years since then, though its share of the vote has gradually declined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Wednesday's election, voters choose the 400 members of the National Assembly and these MPs will then go on in the coming weeks to choose a president from among their number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Candidates for South Africa's nine provincial assemblies were also on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If it falls short of a 50 percent majority, the ANC could be forced to negotiate a coalition deal with one or more of the smaller parties in order to continue governing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the ANC to do well enough to remain the largest party in parliament,
  <br/>
  meaning its leader, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, was likely to stay in office, unless he faced an internal challenge if the party's performance was worse than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter dissatisfaction over high rates of unemployment and crime, frequent power blackouts and corruption in party ranks lies behind the ANC's gradual fall from grace. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said efforts are underway to respond to a court order on formulating an official framework to recognise same-sex partnerships following a landmark ruling last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Court of Final Appeal ruled last September that the government has a constitutional duty to allow gay couples to register their partnerships, in a case brought by former activist Jimmy Sham who married his male partner in New York in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top court said the government would be given two years to come up with an alternative framework so that same-sex relationships could be provided legal recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a request by lawmaker Regina Ip for an update on the situation, constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang said officials are "actively taking forward the relevant work" and will seek the views of the Legislative Council in due course, once there are concrete suggestions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the matter is complex and involves a wide range of issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now following the court's relevant judgment and timetable, conducting detailed study with the [Department of Justice] and relevant bureaux on the mechanism relating to the legal recognition of same-sex relationship, thresholds of recognition, eligibilities, conditions, how to effectively avoid abuses of the alternative framework, etc, as well as the rights and obligations arisen, including 'core rights' and 'supplementary rights', and formulating implementation," he said.

<img alt="Paul Chan met with representatives from five SAR startups currently exploring opportunities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755181_3_20240529124657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday told business leaders in San Francisco that the SAR is a “natural launching pad” for them to enter the Asian and China markets, as he promoted collaboration between the China-US bay areas on a five-day trip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a business luncheon, Chan said there were many commonalities between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area, with the two places the global engines of technological innovation and also the birthplaces of tech firm giants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area are a magnet, attracting a lot of talent, that is our competitive advantage, and also this will give us continuous impetus in terms of innovation and technological development,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to point out there’s also a difference between the two places in terms of population and market sizes, as the Californian bay area has a population of about seven million, while the Guangdong bay area population stands at some 87 million, with huge market potential contributing to some 12 percent of the Chinese economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So if you want to launch your products or services in Asia, in China, Hong Kong is naturally your launching pad, because from here you can springboard to other parts of the mainland and Asia,” he told delegates, noting the SAR’s financial markets are much bigger in breadth and depth compared with Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between InvestHK and San Francisco’s Bay Area Council to promote cooperation especially in the green economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the finance minister also met with representatives of five Hong Kong startups currently exploring expansion in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five SAR startups specialise in areas including biodegradable materials, new construction materials, online marketing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and the entrepreneurs are exploring the market there whilst undertaking training programmes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also welcomed a plan by a Silicon Valley startup accelerator company to set up a technological innovation centre in the SAR.

    Jørn Andersen resigns as SAR head coach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong football head coach Jørn Andersen announced on Wednesday that he has resigned with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andersen said he had received an offer "he couldn't refuse", without disclosing which club it came from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that the local football association "had made every effort to retain" him, offering him a new three-year contract being as his original deal was due to expire next summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After much careful consideration, I have made a difficult decision and decide to take a new challenge, and step down as coach of the Hong Kong, China representative team," Andersen said at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have recently received an invitation from a club outside that presents an opportunity that I simply cannot refuse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian thanked the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, as well as the SAR government, his staff, players and the fans for their support throughout "a fantastic journey" in the past two and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thank all the players who train with me, play with me. And at last, I thank all the great Hong Kong fans who support us everywhere, wherever we were playing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, the coach, 61, had spoken to the press about the association not offering him a new contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association, for its part, said Andersen informed them of his intention to leave on Monday, and officially tabled his resignation on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant coach Wolfgang Luisser has been named interim head coach, with Szeto Man-chun joining the coaching staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andersen took up the head coach role in late 2021. He is considered to have successfully changed the team's culture by playing with a high pressing, attacking style that was relatively rare in the SAR squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, he led the team to its first Asian Cup berth since 1968, with the squad putting up inspiring battles despite defeats against Asian heavyweights Iran and the United Arab Emirates, as well as a surprising Palestinian team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team Hong Kong, China also made history at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year, when Andersen took the under-23 squad to advance to the semi-final stage for the first time ever.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures in India's capital soared to a record-high 49.9 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, the government's weather bureau said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The India Meteorological Department, which reported "severe heat-wave conditions", recorded the temperatures at two New Delhi suburb stations at Narela and Mungeshpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters predict similar temperatures on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May 2022, parts of New Delhi hit 49.2 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India is no stranger to searing summer temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But scientists have found climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi authorities also warned of the risk of water shortages as the capital swelters in an intense heatwave -- cutting supplies to some areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Water Minister Atishi Marlena called for "collective responsibility" to stop wasteful water use, the Times of India newspaper reported Wednesday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's attorney general's office on Wednesday said former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra would be prosecuted for insulting the monarchy over comments he made almost a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prayuth Pecharakun, spokesman for the attorney general, said Thaksin would be summoned to court on June 18 to answer charges under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, 74, is a two-time premier who was ousted in a 2006 coup and then lived in self exile for 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned to Thailand last year as his Pheu Thai party took power at the head of a coalition government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attorney general has decided to indict Thaksin for insulting the monarchy," Prayuth told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attorney general cannot bring him to court today, as his (Thaksin's) lawyer said he has Covid."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand has some of the world's strictest royal defamation laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each charge bringing a potential 15-year prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin's lawyer, Winyat Chatmontree, said he would fight the charges. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s lived-in home prices rose for the second straight month in April, increasing by 0.3 percent from March, with all home sizes seeing gains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Wednesday showed that the latest official price index of second-hand units stood at 308.7 last month, compared with 305.7 in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase was broad-based, as all small, medium, and large sized units saw gains of about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came after the index logged its first increase in 11 months in March, as buyers returned to the market after Financial Secretary Paul Chan scrapped all property cooling measures in his Budget on February 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, taking the first four months in total, home prices still fell 0.84 percent, and the latest index level was still about 13 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rental prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent on a monthly basis, also a second straight increase, but still 4.6 percent lower from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s rents rose 0.5 percent in the first four months of the year.

 Local star footballer Philip Chan won the Hong Kong Footballer of the Year award on Tuesday, the first player from the SAR to do so since goalkeeper Edmond Yapp in 2016.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tai Po midfielder scooped three further trophies at the Top Football Awards Ceremony, including Fan's Favourite, with over 4,500 votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He took home a total of HK$60,000 in prize money by also winning the award for the best player from the local top-flight representing the SAR in international competition, as well as being named one of the midfielders in the season's Best XI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Po finished second in the league this season, with Chan often scoring last-minute winners for the team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder, 31, also scored the 1,000th goal in the history of the Asian Cup in January while playing for the SAR team in Qatar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Eastern swept a number of awards, with Roberto Losada winning Coach of the Year, striker Noah Baffoe Player's Favourite, and midfielders Jesse Yu and Ma Hei-wai named Young Players of the Year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)
