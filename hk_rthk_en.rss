<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday arrested five men over an alleged armed robbery attempt at a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At around noon, five people entered the store at the intersection of Hankow Road and Harbour Road carrying knives and hammers, officers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they had been tipped-off about a planned robbery and were waiting nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the operation to make the arrests, officers had drawn their guns as a warning because the robbers were holding knives and hammers. After the warning, we still used our bare hands to control them," said Superintendent Gar Kam-lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of those arrested suffered a minor injury on his face," Gar added.

    Career expo to attract mainland and foreign talent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As the city held a summit on global talent, the Hong Kong Talent Engage began a two-day career expo on Tuesday, attracting professionals from the mainland and foreign countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A job seeker from Brazil said he had worked in two mainland cities, Shanghai and Hangzhou, for five years and had just come to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the talent scheme makes it easier for people like him to work in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With this visa, I have this opportunity to come, and there's no limitations on what kinds of companies I can work for... This city is very business friendly. People have an entrepreneurial mind," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Top Talent Pass Scheme is one of several talent-admission schemes introduced by the SAR government, and even people who have not secured a job offer in Hong Kong can apply for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another job seeker from Sichuan Province said she wanted to find a job in Hong Kong because of the labour market situation on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could hardly get a [response from mainland companies]. I think I can find more opportunities here. I think I can improve my skills and have a better lifestyle here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recruitment agency said support for workers was very important in order to retain them in a long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe a lot of talent from outside of Hong Kong have got all skill sets that we lack or we're short of," said Eric Ng, chief strategy officer at the agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think all the corporations need to get ready so that they not only can attract them to come, but can retain the talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Professor David Cardwell, echoed Labour Secretary Chris Sun's views that a focus should be on attracting talent from Southeast Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the best talent, academic talent, are in Southeast Asia. The world just needs to adapt to that, to celebrate those talents, but Southeast Asia needs to make it easy for the world to do that as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CareerConnect Expo runs from Tuesday to Wednesday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.

    Israel says it is 'in control' of key Gaza crossing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel army says in 'operational control' of Gaza side of Rafah crossing. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752143_1_20240507144135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said it took "operational control" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Tuesday and that troops were scanning the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Right now we have special forces scanning the crossing... We have operational control of the area and other crossings and we have special forces scanning the area," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are only talking about the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking “operational control” of the crucial crossing for both aid and those able to flee into Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage released by the Israeli military showed a tank entering the crossing. Details of the video matched known features of the crossing and showed Israeli flags flying from tanks that seized the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was “being used for terrorist purposes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military did not provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack that killed four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom Crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military also said that ground troops and airstrikes targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt previously warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario that could threaten a 1979 peace deal with Israel that’s been a linchpin for regional security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian officials said the proposal called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides would also negotiate a “permanent calm” that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas militant group, which controls Gaza, has sought clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all hostages. (Agencies)

    'Improved dental registration to avoid queuing pain'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health secretary Lo Chung-mau said at Legco that officials are working to develop a registration and disc distribution system." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752127_1_20240507124501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Preliminary registration for dental appointments at government clinics will start four hours earlier than usual from July to prevent patients from queuing overnight and making multiple trips, according to officials, after the city's auditor called on authorities to review the arrangements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission earlier observed some patients queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment for the following day before registration starts at 12am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under current arrangements, patients who have pre-registered to see the dentist must return to the clinic in person in the morning to pick up a disc for their appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Legco's public accounts committee, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said registration would instead begin at 8pm for the following day's slots starting from July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After [preliminary] registration, patients only need to report to the clinic half an hour before the appointed time and have their identity cards checked, and then they can receive service. The improved arrangement can avoid the pain of queueing overnight and making multiple journeys to the clinics," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Thursday, registration and disc distribution at a Sai Kung government dental clinic would begin at 1pm instead of 11am, so that patients can immediately receive services that begin at 1:30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said an electronic system for appointment registration at dental clinics was in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patients no longer have to physically get a disc. The online platform will provide information of the number of remaining quota discs of the 11 clinics. We have started the work of developing the system, which will be launched shortly," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials attributed a shortage of dental staff to difficulties in increasing the annual quota of appointment slots, with Director of Health Ronald Lam pointing to a shortfall of 108 practitioners, which accounted for 30 percent of the total manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said authorities decided to allocate to more resources to serving the underprivileged by raising the number of slots from 20,000 to 60,000 next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government's efforts to attract talent to the city will focus on professionals from Southeast Asia and Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun’s remark came after the government approved 180,000 talent importation scheme applications, with 120,000 people having already arrived in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Global Talent Summit, Sun said most of the applicants were from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the labour minister said the government is committed to welcoming talent from all over the world, with a focus on Southeast Asia and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very sure once we have let them know all the growth prospects, all the very exciting opportunities here in Hong Kong, a lot of the talents in Southeast Asia as well as in Europe, they will be thinking about Hong Kong and they will really give Hong Kong a good shot," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the government expects around 7,000 people to attend the two-day summit at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping on Tuesday said the central government fully supports Hong Kong in attracting international entrepreneurs and talent to develop their ambitions in the SAR, as well as the integration of the Greater Bay Area into global innovation networks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Global Talent Summit in Wan Chai, Wang said the nation has the largest talent resources pool in the world, with over 80 million technical professionals and over 200 million skilled workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of people who have received higher education exceeds 240 million, while China is ranked first in the world for the number of research and development personnel and patent applications, the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said these things provide a solid foundation for the nation to support Hong Kong in building a “new highland” of international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The central government attaches great importance to Hong Kong's role in building human resources, and fully supports Hong Kong in conducting wider and closer exchanges and cooperation with other parts of the world to attract aspiring entrepreneurs to Hong Kong to develop their ambitions”, said Wang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We support building a high-level talent base in the Greater Bay Area, attracting global high-level innovation talent, businesses, as well as research institutions to the Greater Bay Area, as well as promoting the region to be integrated into the global innovation networks,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to China’s transition towards high-quality development, the minister also said the nation will concentrate on industrial modernisation and cultivate more high-quality, innovative professionals to develop “new quality productive forces”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation will also push forward creating mechanisms and platforms to introduce global talent into the Greater Bay Area, which will provide new impetus for Hong Kong’s prosperity and integration into national development, she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong is the place to be for global talent, in part because the SAR has long been one of Asia's most liveable cities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a government-organised summit on talent, the CE said Hong Kong is the only city where "the global and China advantages" come together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that other institutional strengths include prime business prospects because of the One Country, Two Systems principle, a low tax system as well as the free flow of information, capital, goods and people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said language is never a problem because English and Chinese are both official languages in the SAR, and Hong Kong will get even more multilingual as it thrives as a cultural hub where East meets West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that 40 percent of the territory is earmarked as country parks with a UNESCO geopark, endless hiking trails and stunning beaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, you don't just get world-class work opportunities, you get a satisfying life, too," Lee said in an opening speech at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, choosing to relocate to Hong Kong on your own or with your loved ones is a big decision. But I'm here to tell you, that this is the place where you can work hard, play hard and enjoy hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the central government's recent move to relax visa rules for Shanghai and Beijing businesspeople to come to Hong Kong will promote professional exchanges and reinforce the SAR's role as the country's international talent hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also thanked senior officials from Beijing, particularly Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping, as well as those from Guangdong and Macau, for attending the summit and sharing their ideas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Brunson produced a scintillating fourth quarter performance as the New York Knicks edged past the Indiana Pacers 121-117 in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series opener on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Knicks talisman Brunson finished with 43 points, six rebounds and six assists to give New York the early advantage in their best-of-seven conference semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was his ice-cool performance down the stretch that swept New York to victory in front of 19,812 fans at an electric Madison Square Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks guard rattled in 21 points in the fourth quarter to complete his fourth straight playoff game with 40 points or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donte DiVincenzo backed Brunson with 25 points while Josh Hart weighed in with a monster performance that included 24 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists, three steals and a block.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner led the Pacers scorers with 23 points while Pascal Siakam added 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's what you love about Jalen," Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said after the win. "I could go on and on about him, but the thing I love about him is he's all about the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson's fourth quarter rally settled a pulsating contest that saw neither side gain more than a single-digit advantage across four quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers opened up a nine-point lead early in the fourth quarter before the Knicks came roaring back to reel it in, edging into a four-point lead at 113-109 after Brunson's step-back jumper with 2min 42sec remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DiVincenzo also came up with a huge clutch play with 40 seconds remaining, nailing a 28-foot three-pointer to put New York 118-115 ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana got back to within one at 118-117 but a harsh offensive foul called against Turner on DiVincenzo with 13 seconds remaining proved decisive, ceding possession back to New York and allowing the hosts to close out the win. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian woman, accused of killing her in-laws with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington, pleaded not guilty to a raft of murder charges on Tuesday, court officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erin Patterson faces three counts of murder for allegedly dishing up a poisonous meal in July 2023 that killed her parents-in-law, as well as the wife of a local pastor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 49-year-old, who is also accused of attempting to kill her estranged husband four times, indicated to a Melbourne court that she would fight the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court officials said the case, which has captured headlines around the world, would now be fast-tracked for trial at the Supreme Court of Victoria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patterson allegedly served the beef Wellington to her estranged parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, as well as local Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, 69, and his wife Heather Wilkinson, 66.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have previously suggested the meal she served included lethal death cap mushrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the lunch guests -- Don and Gail Patterson, and Heather Wilkinson -- died in the days following the meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ian Wilkinson recovered after spending nearly two months in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Detectives said husband Simon Patterson also "became ill after meals" served by his estranged wife on four separate occasions in 2021 and 2022 -- and have charged Erin Patterson with his attempted murder. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday thanked President Xi Jinping for backing his idea of a truce in all conflicts including Ukraine during the Paris Olympics this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I thank you for showing your desire during our talks to ask all parties to have an Olympic truce," Macron said at a joint press conference, adding that such a truce for "all theatres" of war could help achieve lasting peace in the conflicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Ukraine, President Xi said China supports the convening of an international peace conference on the crisis at an appropriate time. He said the conference should be recognized by both Russia and Ukraine, with equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also said he would welcome President Macron to visit China again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi arrived in Paris on Sunday for a two-day visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a meeting with Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, Xinhua news agency reported that Xi said the two countries should always define China-Europe relations as a comprehensive strategic partnership, and remove various distractions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron is set take Xi to the Pyrenees on Tuesday, a mountainous region dear to the French president as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.

  Xi will then leave France for Serbia before completing his European tour in Hungary. (Xinhua and AFP)

    Boeing Starliner spaceship launch postponed
   </title>
   <link>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The postponement was announced about two hours before blast-off. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752092_1_20240507090426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically postponed around two hours before launch after a new safety issue was identified, officials said Monday, in a fresh blow to the US aerospace giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already strapped in their seats preparing for lift-off when the call for a "scrub" came, in order to give engineers time to investigate anomalous readings from an oxygen relief valve on the second stage of the rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Standing down on tonight's attempt to launch," tweeted NASA chief Bill Nelson. "As I've said before, @NASA's first priority is safety. We go when we're ready."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission comes at a challenging time for Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs its commercial aviation division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test flight, which has already experienced years of delays, is a crucial step for the space agency, which has long sought a second commercial partner to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a nearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the Space Shuttle program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clad in Boeing's bright blue spacesuits, the astronauts were helped out of the spaceship then boarded a van to leave the launch tower at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, returning to their quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next possible launch window is on Tuesday, then Friday and Saturday, assuming the issue is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will be propelled into orbit by an Atlas V rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture. Once in space, the crew will take the helm, piloting the craft manually to test its capabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts, both Navy-trained pilots and space program veterans, have each been to the ISS twice, traveling once on a shuttle and then aboard a Russian Soyuz vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule with a cabin about as roomy as an SUV, is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS for a week-long stay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams and Wilmore will conduct a series of tests to verify the capsule's functionality before returning to Earth for a parachute-assisted landing in the western United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by numerous setbacks in the Starliner programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, software defects meant the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS. "Ground intervention prevented loss of vehicle," said NASA in the aftermath, chiding Boeing for inadequate safety checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022 in a non-crewed launch. But other problems that came to light -- including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin that needed to be removed -- caused further delays to the crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA use on regular ISS missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club four years ago, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of US$4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules under its Commercial Crew Program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marked a shift in NASA's approach from owning space flight hardware to instead paying private partners for their services as the primary customer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took a swipe at Boeing, gloating that his company "finished 4 years sooner" despite receiving a smaller contract. He attributed Boeing's delay to "too many non-technical managers" in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to taxi humans to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the orbital lab is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used for future private space stations that several companies are developing. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama was voted NBA Rookie of the Year in a unanimous decision on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French star received all 99 first-place votes from a media panel voting on the award, joining Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard and Karl-Anthony Towns as unanimous winners of the award. Oklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren was a strong runner-up by receiving 98 of a possible 99 second-place votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama lived up to the hype surrounding him as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft. He averaged 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals in 71 games. His 254 total blocks led the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama led all NBA rookies in points, rebounds and blocks along with double-doubles [43] and triple-doubles [two]. He became the youngest player in league history to post a 5x5 when he had 27 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, five blocks and five steals against the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama became the first player in NBA history to tally 1,500 points, 700 rebounds, 250 assists, 250 blocked shots and 100 3-pointers in a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the first player from France to win the award and third member of the Spurs, joining franchise legends David Robinson and Tim Duncan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlotte's Brandon Miller [86 total points, including one second-place vote], Miami's Jaime Jaquez Jr. [10 points], Golden State's Brandin Podziemski [four points] and Dallas' Dereck Lively II [one point] also received votes. (Reuters)

    Crystal Palace thrash Man Utd 4-0

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palace have four wins and one draw in their last five under Oliver Glasner. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752087_1_20240507080913.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Michael Olise scored a brace of goals as Crystal Palace completed a league double over Manchester United for the first time in their history with a thumping 4-0 victory at Selhurst Park on Monday that will add to the pressure on Erik ten Hag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A makeshift United defence that included Casemiro at centre-back was easily picked apart by Palace on several occasions as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell were also on the scoresheet in the impressive win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, two points behind Newcastle United in sixth, with their hopes of European football next season fading fast. Palace are still in 14th with 43 points from 36 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United had several injury absentees and were without Bruno Fernandes, the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career he has missed a match with injury, but the ease with which they were beaten will be a huge concern for everyone at the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A big disappointment. We just had an off-day and we weren't in it," midfielder Christian Eriksen said. "It is what it is. We can't really change the injury things. We have to do what we can on the pitch to change it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today it didn't matter who we played. Everyone could have done better. We tried to do what we could but we were not good enough. We'll take the blame as players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first time in the Premier League era United have lost 13 games in a season and the scoreline might have been worse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home side took the lead inside 12 minutes as Olise collected a throw and evaded a limp challenge from Casemiro. With no United player attempting to close him down, he was able to unleash a low shot from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 2-0 five minutes before the break as Mateta breezed past United defender Jonny Evans and thrashed the ball into the net for a ninth goal in 11 games since the arrival of Glasner in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The striker had scored 11 goals in his previous 80 games for Palace before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United’s makeshift defence was struggling to contain the movement of their hosts and when Diogo Dalot failed to deal with a ball to the back post, Mitchell had a tap-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olise’s second goal added more salt to the wound and it could have been worse for the visitors as Odsonne Edouard saw his shot come back off the woodwork late on. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks advanced on Monday, extending a rally on hopes for possible Federal Reserve interest rate cuts soon after weaker US jobs data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US stocks were in positive territory the whole session as analysts pointed to Friday's jobs report showing weaker than expected employment growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A note from Charles Schwab characterised the report as "perfect" in terms of being in "not too hot and not too cold territory," while adding that "it's just one set of numbers and there's a risk that the market may overreact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 38,852 up 0.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.0 percent to 5,180, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.2 percent to 16,349.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices have risen the last three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Paramount Global gained 3.1 percent following a New York Times report that it entered into talks with a bidding group led by Sony Pictures and Apollo after negotiations between Paramount and Skydance didn't produce a deal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham manager David Moyes will leave "by mutual consent" when his contract expires at the end of the season, the Premier League club said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement of Moyes's impending exit came just a day after the Hammers suffered an embarrassing 5-0 loss to London rivals Chelsea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires," said a club statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's announcement came amid media speculation that former Real Madrid, Wolves and Spain manager Julen Loptegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes, in his second spell as West Ham manager, after the end of the current campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moyes said: "I have enjoyed four-and-a-half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I joined West Ham for a second time, the club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 61-year-old Scot, a former manager of Everton, added: "After leading the club (West Ham) to safety, we guided the team to finishes of sixth and seventh in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June – the club's first major trophy in 43 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four-and-a-half years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham joint chairman David Sullivan told the club's website: "On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia announced on Monday that its troops stationed near Ukraine would run nuclear weapons drills and threatened to strike UK military targets outside the embattled country, citing what it said was an escalation in Western sabre-rattling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry announced the drills and also said Russian forces had captured two villages in eastern Ukraine, where outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian troops have been struggling to hold their positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in the border region of Belgorod meanwhile said that Ukrainian aerial attacks had left at least seven people dead and wounded over 30, including several children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin, who ordered the nuclear drills, has upped his nuclear rhetoric since ordering his army into Ukraine in 2022, warning in February there was a "real" risk of nuclear war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry gave no date for the exercises, but said they would involve the air force, navy and troops stationed near Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said they were aimed at ensuring Russian territorial integrity in the face of Western "threats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin specified that the exercises were a response to statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and British officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has in recent days hit out at Macron for telling The Economist magazine he was "not ruling anything out" in the West's response to the conflict in Ukraine, including sending troops to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also blasted UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for saying Kyiv has the right to strike targets inside Russia. (AFP)

    Biden speaks with Netanyahu as Rafah invasion looms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden held urgent talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday after Israel defied repeated US warnings and told Palestinians to evacuate part of the southern Gaza city of Rafah ahead of an offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came as Biden mounts a diplomatic offensive to get ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas back on track, with Jordan's King Abdullah II due at the White House for lunch on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden told Netanyahu in April that invading Rafah would be a "mistake," and Washington has said it does not support an offensive without a credible plan to protect some 1.2 million civilians sheltering there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House confirmed that "President Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Netanyahu," and said it would release a readout with details of the call soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden did not respond to shouted questions and walked straight to the Oval Office from his helicopter, Marine One, after arriving back at the White House from a weekend at his family home in Wilmington, Delaware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the US National Security Council, announcing earlier that the call would take place, said "we have made our views clear on a major ground invasion of Rafah to the Israeli government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to believe that a hostage deal is the best way to preserve the lives of the hostages, and avoid an invasion of Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those talks are ongoing now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is under growing domestic pressure about the war in Gaza in an election year, with pro-Palestinian protests roiling US university campuses in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York's prestigious Columbia University, which has been at the heart of the protests, said on Monday it had canceled the main graduation ceremony for students next week. (AFP)

    Political veteran set to become Scotland's next leader

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752059_1_20240506235527.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scottish political veteran John Swinney on Monday was named head of the pro-independence SNP party, leaving him poised to become Scotland's new leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swinney, 60, said on X, formerly Twitter, he was "deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP" after Humza Yousaf resigned last week after little more than a year as Scottish leader and head of the Scottish National Party (SNP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters later that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence his key policy idea was the eradication of child poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a curse and under my leadership I want to eradicate it in Scotland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On independence he said the party would "get our act together" to win back the votes of supporters who may have turned away from the party in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Humza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swinney, an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, will now face a vote in the Scottish parliament later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape. (AFP)

    Judge threatens Trump with jail

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial sanctioned him on Monday for violating his gag order again. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752053_1_20240506222820.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal trial on Monday said he would hold the former president in contempt of court for a 10th time for violating a gag order, and warned he would consider jailing him for any further violations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Justice Juan Merchan said the nine fines he had imposed so far did not seem to be deterring Trump from violating the gag order, which prohibits him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan said he considered jail time “truly the last resort” for many reasons, including the disruption to the trial, the political implications of jailing a leading presidential candidate ahead of an election and the extraordinary security challenges of incarcerating an ex-president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said Trump’s “continued, willful” violations of the gag order amounted to a “direct attack on the rule of law.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I do not want to impose a jail sanction and have done everything I can to avoid doing so. But I will if necessary,” Merchan said from the bench in the absence of the jury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York law allows fines of up to US$1,000 or jail time of up to 30 days for violating a court-imposed gag order. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The five-day Golden Week holiday ending on May 5 saw some 766,000 mainland visitor arrivals to Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752047_1_20240506213637.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More mainland tourists came to Hong Kong during the Golden Week holiday compared to the previous year, the government revealed on Monday, saying the number of inbound arrivals from across the border met expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration said the city saw about 766,000 mainland visitor arrivals over the five-day break ending on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On average, Hong Kong recorded some 153,000 inbound trips from the mainland each day, about 22 percent more than last year's Golden Week holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the Golden Week was affected by the rain most of the time, the number of mainland visitors reached around 760,000, matching our initial estimate and bringing Hong Kong's economy with more than HK$2 billion consumption returns," said Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 570 tour groups from the mainland came to Hong Kong during the five-day period, while May 2 recorded the highest number of inbound arrivals with 192,000 people arriving in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials earlier estimated about 800,000 mainland visitor arrivals for the holiday period.

    Fire services body reports potential data leak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Fire Services Department says there's no evidence that data subject to a potential leak has been released.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department (FSD) on Monday said the personal information of thousands of people, including its staff and individuals who filed tree collapse reports during a super typhoon, could have been leaked after the right to access the data was altered without permission.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it reassured the public there was no evidence that any such data had actually been released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it discovered personal data potentially being exposed on one of its IT systems last Friday, which involved the surnames and telephone numbers of some 480 people who had reported tree collapses when Super Typhoon Saola hit Hong Kong in September last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 5,000 fire services staff were also affected and had their names, phone numbers, ranks and numbers, and postings subject to the potential leak, with some even having their incomplete identity card numbers possibly exposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The FSD believes that the incident happened when the outsourced contractor handled the data migration procedure. During the process, the access right of the data was found altered without authorisation, posing a potential risk of data leakage," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department has demanded the outsourced contractor to immediately suspend the system and all of its contract jobs, while withdrawing its access right to the system to prevent data being exposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also apologised and notified those affected through text messages or phone calls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest incident came after a string of data breaches at major public bodies, such as the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Companies Registry, with a lawmaker calling for the heads of government departments responsible for such leaks to be held accountable for the blunders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday attended a China-France-EU trilateral meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said China regarded Europe as an important partner in helping it achieve its modernisation goals and said the two sides should stay committed to their partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president added China regarded Europe as a priority of its foreign policy, and sees China-EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

  Apo Wu, who heads the Art Promotion Office, said some 900,000 people have already been to see the "teamLab: Continuous" exhibition since it opened as part of "Art@Harbour 2024" on March 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It surpassed our expectation. We do hope that more people can visit the exhibition and take advantage of the opportunity, which is why we extended the period by almost a week. We hope to see more visitors in the remaining time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu said the free exhibition has been a hit with mainland tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of similar exhibitions in the mainland, but they require an admission fee. So I think this exhibition has an attractiveness to people from the mainland. The weather during the Labour Day Golden Week was really bad with heavy rain, but we still saw some people go during light rainy periods," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an outdoor exhibition after all so the weather does affect the viewing experience. So we hope for the remaining viewing period, the weather will be nice, so that more people, despite the ending of the holiday period, can come back to Hong Kong to experience [the exhibition]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu added that a requirement for visitors to make bookings for part of the exhibition area will be scrapped from May 8.

    Jury to decide if liver patient died of misadventure

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jurors looking into the death of a liver disease patient, who died a few months after two transplants, were told on Monday to consider ruling that she died of misadventure or natural causes, or, less preferably, give an open verdict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. But her condition worsened and she died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After hearing from more than a dozen doctors who testified at court, coroner Monica Chow gave guidance to the jury on the 12th and final day of the inquest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner said if members of the jury, based on all the evidence heard in court, believed her liver failed because of a steroid or a kind of anti-cholesterol medication, then they should rule that she died of misadventure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, she said, if they think Tang actually suffered from auto-immune hepatitis and that was what triggered her liver failure, then they should rule that she died of natural causes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner said in case they cannot determine what caused her liver failure, the jury can give an open verdict, but there should be enough evidence to decide what happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jury will retire to consider its verdict on Tuesday.

    Punish officials over govt data leaks: lawmaker

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The heads of government departments responsible for data leaks should be held accountable and punished for the blunders, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the Companies Registry said data on some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform, just a day after the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department said a password problem put data on 17,000 public housing tenants at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quat, who chairs Legco's Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting, said personal data leaks by government departments and public bodies are completely unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the heads of departments should bear responsibility for safeguarding sensitive data, rather than relying on the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), which serves as the government's main IT support office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The head of the department should be responsible for all the cyber security issues of their own department, computer system and networking. We suggest the government to make sure that all the government heads, department heads and also the IT project heads are responsible for all the cyber security issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, said he was surprised by the apparent failure of the Companies Registry to conduct a security check on a new system prior to its launch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is actually a design fault on a new system implemented. So I was surprised why they had not done any security check before the system was implemented and launched," Fong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Similar mistakes have happened again and again in different IT departments. So if all these IT departments can get guidelines from the OGCIO, I hope we can solve this problem once and for all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong also called on government departments to enhance collaboration in safeguarding data security.

    Israel tells Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said Monday it was evacuating about 100,000 people from eastern Rafah, ahead of an expected ground assault in the southern city of Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The estimate is around 100,000 people," a military spokesman told journalists when asked how many people were being evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1.2 million people are currently sheltering in Rafah, according to the World Health Organisation, most having fled there from elsewhere in Gaza during the seven-month war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation "is part of our plans to dismantle Hamas... we had a violent reminder of their presence and their operational abilities in Rafah yesterday," the military spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an evacuation plan to get people out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three Israeli soldiers were killed and a dozen wounded, the army said, when a barrage of rockets was fired towards the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army said the rockets were fired from an area adjacent to Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldiers were hit while guarding heavy machinery, tanks and bulldozers stationed in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain fell on Monday as the army airdropped leaflets advising about the evacuation, an AFP correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's armed wing claimed the rocket attack, which led Israeli authorities to close the crossing, used to deliver aid into Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong (HKU) nursing student has been cleared of groping a first-year pupil during an orientation camp last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday acquitted Tang Ho-yin, 20, of indecent assault and common assault, two charges he previously pleaded not guilty to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court had heard that Tang indecently assaulted a woman in an activity room at Po Leung Kuk Jockey Club Tai Tong Holiday Camp on August 20, 2023, and groped her again in a dormitory living room the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, magistrate Frances Leung said the witness of the first alleged incident, during a game at the orientation camp, failed to identify the facial features of the perpetrator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court was not reassured that the defendant was the perpetrator, Leung added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the common assault charge against Tang, the judge said the court accepted that the defendant's hand had moved up and down the alleged victim's arm while discussing sexual content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Leung also noted the alleged victim had voluntarily extended her arm out to demonstrate an element of the discussion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China saw a 35 percent jump in the number of arrivals and departures during the May Day holiday from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, border inspection agencies across the country handled nearly 8.47 million entry and exit trips during the five-day holiday that ended on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's a 35.1 percent increase year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the number of arrivals and departures peaked on May 3, with more than 1.8 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland travellers accounted for more than half of all the trips, at 4.77 million; people from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan made 2.92 million trips; and travellers from abroad accounted for the rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed about 295 million domestic tourist trips were made during the May Day holiday, up 7.6 percent year on year and 28.2 percent from the same period in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said both inbound and outbound tourism have been recovering rapidly, due to the resumption of more air routes and introduction of measures to facilitate visitors' entry, among other factors (Reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Eddie Yue, on Monday urged banks to be prepared to operate during severe weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yue told reporters that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is making progress towards ensuring local stock and derivatives markets can still function during adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong Exchanges is now finalising the arrangement and we have asked the banks to make sure that they get prepared, so that whatever the final arrangement is they will be able to support it and we have asked them to make early preparations for example on if there should be any system change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's remarks follow the completion of a public consultation exercise by HKEX in January on ending stock market closures during severe weather events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Yue said the HKMA will host the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit from November 18 to 20, adding that around 50 to 60 people have confirmed their attendance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA chief said he hopes the summit will attract prominent business figures to Hong Kong and will strengthen the city’s position as an international financial hub.

    Exchange Fund posts HK$54.3bn first quarter gain

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said its Exchange Fund posted an investment gain of HK$54.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, despite the underwhelming performance of local stock markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the second consecutive quarter of gains for the fund, whose primary role is to back the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a panel meeting in the Legislative Council, the HKMA revealed that the fund lost HK$2.3 billion in local equities in the first quarter and lost HK$4.8 billion on its foreign exchange assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, these were offset by gains of HK$25.1 billion from bond investments and HK$36.3 billion from other stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the future performance of the fund remains uncertain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The uncertainty about the US interest rate path, which will depend on the path of inflation in the US... we will still need to see the incoming economic data and see where the inflation path in the US will go, and see whether they will, as the market is expecting now, defer the rate cut decision and also the pace may be a little slower than expected before,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue also said tensions in the Middle East and the pace of economic recovery in mainland China contribute additional uncertainty to the performance of the Exchange Fund.

    'Rainstorm warnings can't be district-specific'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Leung Wing-mo said it's impossible to issue rainstorm warnings for particular districts because rain is unpredictable. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751967_1_20240506120141.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spokesman for the Hong Kong Meteorological Society, Leung Wing-mo, said on Monday that it would not be possible to tailor rainstorm warnings for particular districts, because rain is extremely unpredictable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, the Red Rainstorm Warning was in place for nearly seven hours and flooding and landslides were reported in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory had at one point raised the possibility of a Black Rainstorm Warning and some people questioned why the alert wasn't issued, even though rain was particularly heavy where they were.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, a former assistant director at the observatory, said rainstorm warnings are generally issued when rainfall at a certain amount of monitoring stations around the city meet the relevant criteria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that on Saturday, government forecasters provided supplementary information regarding the amount of rain recorded in different places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Really, the downpours are part of nature, they may happen wherever. So forecasting where exactly the rain will be is very difficult," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can only issue warnings based on rainfall for the whole of Hong Kong, that the amount recorded or the expected amount, triggers the corresponding rainstorm warning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung described the heavy rain on Saturday as rare, although he noted that April is regarded as belonging to the "flooding season" in South China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the climate has changed because of global warming and people can expect more extreme weather conditions and heavier rain from now on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Sai Kung district councillor Christine Fong said hundreds of vehicles were trapped by floods on Saturday after the heavy rain caught drivers by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested officials build stormwater storage facilities or an artificial lake in Hebe Haven and Ho Chung.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Monday said various sectors should reflect on how to attract more tourists, as consumption patterns have changed since the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Journal, Dane Cheng said he was satisfied that Hong Kong saw about 11 million visitor arrivals in the first quarter of the year, and he expects the number to rise in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said Hong Kong has been doing a lot in terms of promotion and holding mega events, and it's time for different sectors to reflect on how to attract more tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The problem now is, tourist numbers recovered back to 70 percent [of pre-Covid numbers], but the departure number for local people is over 100 percent... No matter whether it's the catering sector or the retail sector, if your business can't retain the locals, how can you expect it to attract tourists?" he questioned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that people should stop comparing current tourist numbers with those before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's unrealistic for tourist numbers to return to the levels of 2018 and 2019... Back then, when so many people were coming to Hong Kong, no matter which area was that, Hong Kong people were overloaded. Tourists also want a good experience, instead of staying in a crowded place," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, chairwoman of the Travel Industry Council Gianna Hsu said there were about 760,000 mainland tourist arrivals during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after attending a radio programme, Hsu said the rainy weather did not affect the mood of tourists, and some businesses even benefited from the poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was rain occasionally, urging some tourists to visit shopping malls. Therefore, I believe the retail sales for shopping malls had seen improvements. We expect Golden Week will bring about HK$2 billion consumption revenue to Hong Kong. We look forward to the next Golden Week holiday," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers silenced the young guns of Orlando, beating the Magic 106-94 in game seven of their NBA playoffs first-round series Sunday to book a meeting with Eastern Conference top seeds Boston.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was another magisterial performance from Mitchell, who scored 39 points two days after pouring in 50 in the Cavs' game six defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time he had plenty of scoring support from teammates as the Cavs erased an 18-point second-quarter deficit to clinch a series in which the home team won every game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caris LeVert scored 15 points off the bench and Max Strus scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter, when the Cavs out-scored the Magic 33-15 to take charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evan Mobley scored 11 points with 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to help Cleveland withstand a 38-point performance from Paolo Banchero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, with starting center Jarrett Allen sidelined a third straight game with bruised ribs, moved on to the second round a year after a stinging first-round loss to the New York Knicks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Magic pushed their lead to as many as 18 points in the second quarter before the Cavs clawed back to cut the lead to single digits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banchero's layup in the closing seconds of the first half saw Orlando take a 10-point lead into the break, but momentum was on Cleveland's side and they overwhelmed the Magic in the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitchell, relentless in the paint, tied it at 64-64 with a floater and LeVert drained a pair of free throws to give the Cavs their first lead since the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs pushed their advantage to 14 points in the final frame, fans chanting "We want the Celtics" as the final minutes ticked off. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "About time huh?" said Norris, "I knew on Friday that we had the pace...today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off," he added. (AFP)

    'Shortened nursing programme won't affect teaching'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has announced plans to shorten the duration of its nursing programme starting from the new academic year in September, allowing students to complete the entire course in 3.5 years instead of the current four years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HA launched the Professional Diploma in Nursing three years ago, offering classes in its three nursing schools at Caritas Medical Centre, Tuen Mun and Queen Elizabeth hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon graduation, students can choose to become registered general nurses and pursue a bachelor’s degree in other institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Au, principal at Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s nursing school, explained the decision to shorten the duration of the programme was made “in view of the arrangement of placement and learning for the students”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually there is no change in the contents we teach to the students, like the theories and the skills, there is no change, just the period has been shortened,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said students will still be entitled to at least 1,400 hours of internship in public hospitals and their learning outcome won't be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From their very first placement, students will assist registered nurses to carry out various tasks, including measuring blood pressure, feeding dependent patients and distributing medications, Au said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about the high attrition rate among nurses in recent years, with over 1,800 full-time nurses at public hospitals having left their positions last year, Au stressed the three nursing schools had already reached their maximum capacity with 300 places offered each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said a lot would need to be considered if authorities wanted to increase quotas at the schools, including finding extra teaching space and staff, as well as liaising with the Nursing Council of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tuition fee for the 3.5-year programme is HK$132,700. Applications close on July 19.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eurovision 2024 began in the Swedish city of Malmo on Sunday when 37 contenders walked the "Turquoise Carpet" amid heightened security and calls for boycotts due to Israel's participation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 68th version of the song contest, which is always billed as non-political, is taking place against the backdrop of the devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much focus is expected to be on Israeli contestant Eden Golan, when she performs her song "Hurricane" in the second semi-final on Thursday, with bookmakers placing the entry among the top 10 to win the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli delegation did not attend the carpet on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, said Swedish broadcaster SVT, which co-organises the contest with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song "October Rain", which the EBU said made reference to the October 7 Hamas onslaught.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The contest comprises three live shows, with half a dozen countries having a shot at the title this year, according to fans and bookmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Loreen won the 2023 competition in Liverpool, northern England, with her song "Tattoo", granting the Nordic country an automatic entry into next Saturday's grand final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Big Five" of the EBU - the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - are also automatically given a spot in the final, while the other contenders will compete in semi-finals for the remaining places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be the seventh time Sweden is hosting the song contest after last doing so in 2016, and the third time Malmo will stage the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's participants for this year, twins Marcus & Martinus, were drawn in March to open the final with their dance pop song "Unforgettable". (Reuters)

    Gaza ceasefire hopes fade amid impasse

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians look at the rubble left after an Israeli strike on a house in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751914_1_20240506005518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prospects for a Gaza ceasefire appeared slim on Sunday as Hamas reiterated its demand for an end to the war in exchange for the freeing of hostages, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flatly ruled that out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two sides blamed each other for the impasse and the Hamas delegation said it would leave Cairo truce talks on Sunday night to consult with its leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In their second day of talks with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, Hamas negotiators maintained their stance that any truce agreement must end the war, Palestinian officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have not travelled to Cairo to take part in indirect diplomacy, but on Sunday Netanyahu reiterated Israel's aim since the start of the war nearly seven months ago: to disarm and dismantle the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for good or else endanger Israel's future security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said Israel was willing to pause fighting in Gaza in order to secure the release of hostages still being held by Hamas, believed to number more than 130.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But while Israel has shown willingness, Hamas remains entrenched in its extreme positions, first among them the demand to remove all our forces from the Gaza Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas in power," Netanyahu said. "Israel cannot accept that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indicating that this round of talks may soon unwind, a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters on Sunday: "If Netanyahu doesn't change his mind, there will be no reason to stay. They can always reconvene if that changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The latest round of mediation in Cairo is near to collapse," one official briefed on the talks told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas did not seem to be serious about reaching a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are observing worrying signs that Hamas does not intend to reach an agreement with us," Gallant said. "This means strong military action in Rafah will begin in the very near future, and in the rest of the Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released shortly after Netanyahu's, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was still keen on reaching a comprehensive ceasefire that ends the Israeli "aggression", guarantees Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and achieves "a serious" deal to free Israelis being held hostage in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh blamed Netanyahu for "the continuation of the aggression and the expansion of the circle of conflict, and sabotaging the efforts made through the mediators and various parties".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began after Hamas stunned Israel with a cross-border raid on October 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed, 29 of them in the past 24 hours, and more than 77,000 have been wounded in Israel's assault, according to Gaza's health ministry. The bombardment has devastated much of the coastal enclave and caused a humanitarian crisis. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand secured double glory at the Singapore Sevens on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's tournaments to signal their Olympic intent with the Paris Games fast approaching.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's men held off a determined challenge from Ireland to win 17-14 while their women's team surged to a 31-21 victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand raced into an early 10-0 lead in the men's final with tries by Leroy Carter and Fehi Fineanganofo but Gavin Mullin narrowed the deficit for the Irish just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dylan Collier restored New Zealand's 10-point cushion in the second half but Harry McNulty's response set up a tense finale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held on for their second series win in a row after their success at Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand forward Tone Ng Shiu said his team were building momentum for the sevens series grand final in Madrid and the Paris Olympics in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We started off slow in the world series this year but now we're just building up to the Olympics, taking it one tournament at a time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two wins in a row -- you've got to be happy with that," added Ng Shiu, who was in the New Zealand side that took the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know there's a bit of pressure to get that gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried two times and we weren't quite there. So hopefully we can embrace the pressure at the next tournament and build for the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina were crowned men's series winners after they recovered from a 10-point deficit to beat South Africa 14-10 in the fifth-place playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Americans won tournaments earlier this season in Cape Town, Perth and Vancouver to top the table with 106 points, two points ahead of the second-placed Irish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain bounced back from a heart-breaking 15-12 extra-time loss to Ireland in the semi-finals to trounce Australia 29-7 in the third-place match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result saw GB leapfrog the United States for eighth place in the league standings and secured their status as a core team in next season's world series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be in that top eight in Madrid secures our programme's funding for another year," said GB captain Robbie Fergusson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means the boys have jobs next year, it means we can have contracts. It means everything," said the Scot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody gave us a hope-in-hell chance this weekend of pushing the USA out of the top eight and taking that spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we had total belief in our group and we did something special this weekend and hopefully we can kickstart a special few months now heading into the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina, Ireland and Great Britain will be joined in the grand final by New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, France and South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, Spain, Samoa and Canada finished outside the top eight and will face four teams from the challenger series in a promotion-relegation event in Madrid to determine next season's core teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, New Zealand clinched top spot in the standings after a hat-trick of tries by Michaela Blyde helped them to a convincing victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a clash between the top two teams, the Black Ferns trailed 14-5 late in the first half but scored four tries to win their fourth straight tournament after victories in Vancouver, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed a Thomas and Uber Cup double on Sunday as both men's and women's teams beat Indonesia to win their respective world team championship finals in Chengdu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men, who won 3-1, lifted China's first Thomas Cup since they beat Japan in 2018 – and their 11th in all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it meant agony again for 14-time winners Indonesia, who lost their second successive final after falling to India two years ago in Bangkok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's event, Indonesia had earlier been powerless to prevent a flawless China lifting the Uber Cup for a record-extending 16th time with a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next most successful women's nation are Japan, who have won the Uber Cup six times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Bingjiao's 10-21, 21-15, 21-17 victory against Ester Nurumi Tri Wardoyo completed a perfect 24-0 tournament match record for China's women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They regained the title they lost to South Korea two years ago in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the night session, world number two Shi Yuqi got China's men off to a fast start by destroying seventh-ranked Anthony Ginting 21-17, 21-6 in 43 hugely impressive minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pivotal moments came in the first doubles as Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang edged an epic to beat Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto 21-18, 17-21, 21-17 in a 64-minute thriller.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair fought back time and again after trailing 10-4 in the opening game, 6-3 in the second and 8-4 in the third in a gutsy display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number three Jonatan Christie gave Indonesia some hope when he beat sixth-ranked Li Shifeng 21-16, 15-21, 21-17 in 1hr 17min of see-saw action to extend the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Indonesia's chances were snuffed out when He Jiting and Ren Xiangyu ran away with the second doubles 21-11, 21-15 in just 37 minutes to beat Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana and seal the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the outranked Indonesian women's slim chances had hinged on Gregoria Mariska Tunjung breaking through in the opening singles against Chen Yufei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chen never allowed her opponent into the contest in a comprehensive 21-7, 21-16 win in just 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I didn't feel that comfortable although I have played such matches before," said Chen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still feel stressed, and maybe my opponent was. I always feel pressured in finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have lost to her before. What I did was watch a lot of matches that I'd lost to her. It's not going to help if I only watch matches that I won."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan did not give Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti and Ribka Sugiarto a sniff in a 39-minute doubles demolition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scariest thing is when people think you should win," said Chen Qingchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Things become different when you assume you can win. The only thing we need to do is prepare and be humble."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their 21-11, 21-8 canter set up He for the Cup-winning victory in the second singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the last three years we experienced failures, and I'm happy that we could regain the title," said He. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool shattered Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the Premier League's top four with a 4-2 win that left Aston Villa on the brink of Champions League qualification despite their 1-0 defeat at Brighton on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a win at Anfield to close the gap on fourth-placed Villa, Tottenham slumped to a fourth successive loss to leave their Champions League hopes in tatters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are seven points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have a game in hand but will miss out on the top four if Unai Emery's men win one of their remaining two matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Salah was back in the Liverpool team after being dropped for last weekend's draw at West Ham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp, in the final weeks of his nine-year reign, was celebrating in the 16th minute when Salah notched his 25th goal in all competitions this term with a clinical header from Cody Gakpo's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Robertson scored Liverpool's second on the stroke of half-time as the Scotland left-back finished from close-range after Salah's shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was worse to come for woeful Tottenham as Gakpo headed in a 50th-minute cross from Harvey Elliott, who netted the fourth in the 59th minute with a superb curler from 20 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was little consolation for Tottenham that Richarlison reduced the deficit in the 72nd minute before setting up Son Heung-min's goal five minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Villa win combined with a Tottenham loss would have sealed a Champions League place for Emery's side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Villa were unable to fulfil their part of that equation as Joao Pedro's 87th-minute goal condemned them to a second painful defeat in four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ending Brighton's six-match winless run, Pedro headed in the rebound after Robin Olsen saved his penalty, which had been awarded for Ezri Konsa's foul on Simon Adingra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Stamford Bridge, seventh-placed Chelsea thrashed West Ham 5-0 to keep alive their hopes of European qualification. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sino-French relations over the past 60 years have been at the forefront of China's ties with major Western countries, setting a good example for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems, President Xi Jinping said on Sunday as he arrived in France for a state visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, met Xi at the airport at the start of his first visit to a European Union country in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written speech, Xinhua reported that Xi also described Sino-French relations as a model of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted the president as saying the development of China-France ties brings benefits to the two peoples and injected stability, positive energy into a turbulent world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also said China was ready to consolidate traditional friendship, enhance political mutual trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields with France through the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi is expected to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen on his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his European visit, Xi will also visit Hungary and Serbia.

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said his cabinet had voted unanimously to close Qatari television network Al Jazeera's operations in Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities did not stipulate when the decision might take effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cabinet vote came after Israel's parliament passed a law allowing the temporary closure in Israel of foreign broadcasters considered to be a threat to national security during the war against Hamas in Gaza. (Reuters/AP)

    Clear Water Bay Road reopens after repair work

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department said early on Monday that Clear Water Bay Road was back to normal, after being disrupted by a landslide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A slope measuring 30 metres long and 40 metres deep collapsed, and part of the pavement also caved in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slip forced officials to implement an arrangement in which two-way traffic shared the same lane near Wing Lung Road in Hang Hau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said earlier that Clear Water Bay Road should be open again by rush hour on Monday morning, after workers carried out remedial work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said workers were spraying concrete onto the slope, and more work would be carried out later to further consolidate the structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we open the road, we have to ensure it's safe after the temporary consolidation work. If we can't do that, we won't open the road," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we'll have measures in place. Our contractor and the Highways Department will keep monitoring the situation here. We'll also liaise with the observatory to see if the weather will worsen, and we've installed some sump pumps in case there's heavy rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities received 14 other landslide reports on Saturday, when the amber and red rainstorm warning signals were in effect for most of the day.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging floods and mudslides this past week have killed at least 55 people in southern Brazil and forced nearly 70,000 to flee their homes, the country's civil defence agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said least 74 people were injured and another 67 were missing from the catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-rising water levels in the state of Rio Grande do Sul were straining dams and threatening the economically important city of Porto Alegre, home to some 1.4 million residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guaiba River, which flows through the city, was at a historic high of 5.04 metres, well above the 4.76 metres that had stood as a record since the devastating floods of 1941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities scrambled to evacuate swamped neighbourhoods as rescue workers used four-wheel-drive vehicles -- and even jet skis -- to move through waist-deep water in search of the stranded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence officials also said more than a million people lacked access to potable water amid the flooding, describing damage as incalculable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Otaegui shot a superb seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to come from five shots back to win the Volvo China Open and a place in the US PGA Championship in two weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard finished on a 54-hole total of 198, 18-under par, to win the weather-shortened event at Hidden Grace Golf Club in Shenzhen after Saturday's play was cancelled because of dangerous storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave him victory by one stroke from Italy's Guido Migliozzi, who carded a final-round 67.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-round leader Sebastian Soderberg of Sweden, who started five clear of Otaegui, saw the title slip from his grasp with a sorry double-bogey at the 18th when a par would have taken him into a playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished at 16-under par after a 72 alongside England's Paul Waring (69) and Switzerland's Joel Girrbach (67).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was starting five shots back so I just didn't look at the leaderboard, not think about the result. Just play my game," said Otaegui who won his fifth DP World (European) Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Otaegui's victory in the final event of the DP World Tour's Asian Swing secured a berth at the season's second major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla, beginning on May 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, that's very good news," said Otaegui when informed that he had finished third on the Asian Swing standings -- enough to get him into the next major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing some majors this year was a big goal for me," said the world number 143.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will just be enough time to rest a little bit at home next week and then head to America."

 A climbing carnival took place at Cheung Chau on Sunday, ahead of the island's traditional bun-scrambling competition on Buddha's Birthday.

  The 14-metre-high bun tower frame is already in place for the competition on May 15, and carnival-goers were given the chance to see whether they could climb it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung said her son had managed the feat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried bun scrambling over the years. When my son was young, he couldn't reach the top. Last time we came, he was able to get there at a slow pace with the help of his dad. But this time, he was able to do it all by himself very quickly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so happy to see him achieve that because yesterday it was raining really hard so I thought there wouldn't be a chance. Luckily the weather is beautiful. It's a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung's 13-year-old son has now climbed the tower at least four times. He gave his advice on the best way to approach the climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There isn't a specific technique to climbing. You just have to grasp the bamboo tightly and watch your footing. I love experiencing Hong Kong culture. I want to preserve and pass on Hong Kong culture like bun scrambling so more people know about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I personally love eating lucky buns and watching bun scrambling on television, so I really wanted to see if it is actually that exhilarating in person, and see if it's really that easy or difficult."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another visitor, Ms Lok, said she brought her friends from overseas to the carnival, so they could experience a bit of Hong Kong culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were shaking while climbing because the gaps are so small, but we had a lot of fun. Huge respect to those who can climb up so quickly. I think this is a great tradition to preserve, and I love the meaning behind it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can pass peace to anyone, even if you aren't Chinese. My friends wanted to experience something quite traditional and this definitely checks the box."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, workers have been working hard to reconstruct the three traditional giant bun towers for display ahead of next week's festivities, after Saturday's heavy winds caused the bamboo scaffolding to collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung Chi-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong Cheung Chau Bun Festival Committee, said it would take one to two days to complete, but progress was going well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never experienced the collapse of the bun tower scaffolding before. It was because the heavy winds hit it down. It is quite a rare incident. The latest situation is quite ideal. We thought it would take three to four days, but they've sent more people to help so the speed has increased significantly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at eight in the morning and everything has already been dismantled, and ready for reconstruction. I think everything can be restored in one to two days. I believe it will be reinforced this time around."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung also said the incident had incurred a cost, but he had not yet calculated how much money was involved. He added it was most important the Bun Festival runs smoothly next week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saul "Canelo" Alvarez retained his undisputed super-middleweight world title with a convincing unanimous decision over fellow Mexican Jaime Munguia on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez handed Munguia the first defeat in 44 professional bouts, dropping the 27-year-old challenger in the fourth round and inexorably taking control to improve to 61-2-2 in his storied career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges scored it 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112 for Alvarez, who retained his IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO belts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, whose 34 knockouts included victories inside the distance in four of his previous five fights, came out on the attack against the vastly experienced Alvarez, pushing him back with his jab and rattling the champion in the third round with a right to the jaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Alvarez responded in the fourth. After Munguia connected with a pair of solid rights Alvarez followed a left hook with a massive uppercut that sent Munguia to the canvas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth round opened to chants of "Canelo!" ringing in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, where support was evenly divided between the Mexican combatants in a fight coinciding with Mexico's Cinco de Mayo festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Alvarez jab popped Munguia's head back and, in the sixth, an Alvarez left hook had Munguia's knees buckling briefly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a fight billed as a possible changing of the guard, Munguia -- who has honed his aggressive style under the tutelage of longtime Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach -- continued to press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his vaunted power rarely bothered Alvarez, who repeatedly found away past Munguia's guard to land the more damaging blows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know, I take my time," Alvarez said of his measured start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a lot of experience. Jaime Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong. He's smart, but I take my time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have 12 rounds to win the fight, and I did. I did really good and I feel proud about it," added Alvarez, who hasn't posted a knockout since he stopped Caleb Plant in the 11th round in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez said that after a few rounds he could see everything that was coming from Munguia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's strong, but he's a little slow," Alvarez said. "I can see every punch." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian police said on Sunday they had shot dead a boy after he stabbed a man in Western Australia's capital Perth, in an attack authorities said indicated terrorism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were signs the 16-year-old, armed with a kitchen knife, had been radicalised online, state authorities said, adding they received calls from concerned members of the local Muslim community before the attack, which occurred late on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack, in the suburb of Willetton, had "hallmarks" of terrorism but was yet to be declared a terrorist act, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone," Western Australia Premier Roger Cook told a televised press conference in the state capital Perth, regarding the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victim, stabbed in the back, was stable in hospital, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the incident by police and intelligence agencies, which advised there was no ongoing threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia," Albanese said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Government bureaus and departments have been asked to review their data security measures and give a reply within a week. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751873_1_20240505145341.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's top IT office on Sunday said it was asking all bureaus and departments to comprehensively review their data security measures, and reply within a week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after reports of two data leaks in the past few days, involving the Companies Registry and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registry said on Friday the data of some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before, the EMSD apologised over the data leak of some 17,000 public housing residents who had to undergo mandatory Covid tests in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the issue on social media, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said it's highly concerned about the incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had again sent clear directives to the heads of bureaus and departments about the reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also reminded all users and systems under the departments that they must stringently comply with the government's rules, policies and guidelines on data security in handling sensitive and personal information," it said in the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office added this includes never storing data on publicly-owned cloud platforms.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says while adjustments will be made to the scheme, officials will try to minimise the effects on beneficiaries. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751866_1_20240505125439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said officials don't plan to change the eligible age and coverage of the HK$2 transport subsidy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government plans to complete a review of the scheme by the end of 2024, as its bill is expected to increase by 50 percent, to more than HK$6 billion this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said while there's a need to make changes to the scheme to ensure it is more financially viable in the long run, officials would keep several aspects of this "good policy" unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overriding principle is that the original intention of the scheme doesn't change - those benefiting from the scheme, that is elderly people aged 60 and above and the disabled, this won't change," the minister said on a TVB programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government did not plan to ban the more expensive bus and minibus trips to the border, saying beneficiaries have gotten used to the travel convenience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials would try their best not to make it troublesome for the beneficiaries, or affect their willingness to travel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that officials would do more to tackle abuses by those who are not eligible for the scheme, and do more promotion to encourage beneficiaries to take cheaper rides whenever possible.

    Golden Week tourists to boost city by HK$2 billion

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the total number of mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong should reach the estimated 800,000 mark with the Golden Week holiday wrapping up on Sunday, adding it would boost the economy by over HK$2 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said approximately 670,000 mainland tourists had already come to the territory in the first four days despite the rainy weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The entire Guangdong Province was affected by the unstable weather, and tourists can see that the weather is also not that good in Hong Kong, so they may postpone their trip. However, the overall numbers aren't bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that we will reach our estimated number of tourists. If we have around 800,000 mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong, I think we can earn over two billion dollars in consumption. Even though we have only reached about 700,000 people so far, we should still reach over two billion dollars."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the mixed reviews of the Labour Day pyrotechnic display, Yeung said it was no surprise that people had expectations for the fireworks show, but the weather was unpredictable in how it would affect the viewing experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rain is hard to predict, unlike wind which comes when it comes. Even if you see rain clouds, you don't know if it will actually rain. So up until 4pm of that day, we then decided it was appropriate to host the show," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was watching from the top of a bridge where the wind was hitting so from the start of the fireworks, the smoke did reach me. However, from other viewing angles, people have sent me clear and beautiful photos of the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added they would learn from this experience and do better in terms of publicity and expectation management in the future.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan is attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Tbilisi. Photo courtesy of Chan's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751862_1_20240505115210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong's economy was maintaining its momentum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan said the city’s GDP had increased five quarters in a row, with growth going up 2.7 percent year-on-year in the quarter ending in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market sentiment had also improved, he said, with the Hang Seng Index gaining almost 14 percent recently after going up for nine consecutive days, while the property market had become more active after measures to curb speculation were lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said inbound tourism was one of the key drivers of the economy in the first quarter, adding the number of arrivals during the first three days of Golden Week, which stood at nearly 650,000, was up 25 percent from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said external uncertainties remained, and that higher interest rates and a strong Hong Kong dollar would affect the city's tourism sector, as well as export and investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on companies to develop new products to explore new ways to manage their businesses, noting that authorities were helping SMEs to go digital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief, who was attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said many participants were interested in the development of the digital economy as well as the innovation and technology sector in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added authorities recently published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, to provide a clearer definition of green products and help the sector reduce "greenwashing" risks.

 It was a three-way thriller to the wire in the 150th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mystik Dan, ridden by Brian Hernandez, held on late to win a three-way photo finish by just a nose over Sierra Leone and Forever Young to capture the first leg of the Triple Crown on Saturday night in front of 156,710 fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's like a dream come true," Hernandez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sent off at odds of 18-1, Mystik Dan made the turn for home in front and stayed on the rail with Forever Young just to his outside and Sierra Leone on the far outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a gasp from the crowd as the three colts hit the finish line. It took several minutes for the racing stewards to look at the finish line photo and declare Mystik Dan the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- which is the closest margin you can have in horse racing -- and it was the first nose decision since Grindstone edged out Cavonnier in the 1996 Derby. (Reuters)
