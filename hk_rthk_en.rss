    LPH quality same as public housing, says NGO

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy director of NGO Society for Community Organization says the quality of the first batch of light public housing matches that of standard public housing, while the rental levels are much cheaper than subdivided flats and 90 percent of standard public housing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Actually, they're quite similar to public housing... only the kitchen is open," said Sze Lai-shan while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze also said the facilities were similar to transitional social housing, which is provided by government-supported NGOs. She said in some cases it was even better as the units were new and there were electrical appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday the government said applications would open later this month for 4,400 of the temporary units in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long. The temporary modular units are intended for people in the queue for public housing, and those who take up the offer of light public housing will remain on the public housing list. Priority will be given to those with urgent needs, such as those living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze said some potential tenants were concerned about how many buses they would need to take, as the new units weren't linked to the MTR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, first introduced the idea of light public housing in his policy address two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the new units will range from HK$740 to HK$2,650.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Cantlay racked up six birdies and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy played a bogey-free round on their ways to 5-under-par 65s to share the lead through the first round of the U.S. Open on Thursday in Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cantlay established the lead early in the day, and McIlroy, the 2011 champion, had birdies on two of the final three holes playing in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Ludvig Aberg shot 66 to hold third place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Golfers had to negotiate the tricky greens on Pinehurst No. 2 along with the increasing heat of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay began the round on No. 10. He got better later in the round, with four birdies on the first eight holes on the front side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Feeling good about my game," Cantlay said. "I've been working hard. I have to just keep putting myself in the fairway, giving myself opportunities and I did a good job of that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time Cantlay has led or co-led in a major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a rough day for Tiger Woods, who shot 74 with two birdies – both on the par-5 holes – and six bogeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler had a mundane 71. Defending champion Wyndham Clark managed just one birdie during his round of 73. (Reuters)

    England thrash Oman to revive T20 World Cup campaign

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England thrashed Oman by eight wickets as the reigning champions revived their T20 World Cup campaign with a record-breaking success in Antigua on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a heavy win to bolster their net run-rate [NRR] as they attempt to overhaul Scotland in the race to qualify for the second-round Super Eights, England dismissed Oman for just 47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England then made 50-2 in a mere 3.1 overs, captain Jos Buttler 24 not out and Jonny Bairstow, who hit the winning boundary, unbeaten on eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This overwhelming Group B victory meant England recorded the largest win in T20 World Cup history in terms of balls remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oman had no answer to England's combination of spin and pace, leg-break bowler Adil Rashid taking 4-11 from his four overs, while express quicks Jofra Archer and Mark Wood both had figures of 3-12 in an innings that ended with nearly seven overs to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Number seven Shoaib Khan [11] was the only Oman batsman to reach double figures after Buttler won the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Significantly, England's NRR climbed to 3.081, better than Scotland's 2.16. England, however, stayed third on three points, behind Scotland's five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already-eliminated Oman, who ended the tournament having lost all four of the games, just scraped past the record lowest completed total of 39 at any T20 World Cup, posted by fellow-non Test nation Uganda against co-hosts West Indies in Guyana last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, beaten by Australia after their group game with Scotland was abandoned due to rain, play Namibia on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia and Scotland, however, will meet on Sunday after England have completed their group games. (AFP)

    Battles rage in Rafah, US says Gaza truce possible

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A demonstrator carries a sign demanding the world's attention for Rafah during a pro-Palestinian protest at the White House, Washington, DC. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757345_1_20240613230420.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli helicopters struck Gaza's Rafah on Thursday, residents said, with Hamas reporting street battles in the southern city after top US diplomat Antony Blinken said a truce was still possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the war raged on, and tensions soared on Israel's northern border with more attacks by Lebanon's Hezbollah forces targeting military positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, which has traded near-daily fire with Hamas ally Hezbollah since the start of the Gaza war, said it would respond "with force".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli ground forces have been operating in Rafah since early May, despite widespread alarm over the fate of Palestinian civilians there, including in a ruling by the International Court of Justice later that month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western areas of Rafah came under heavy fire on Thursday from the air, sea and land, residents said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said its fighters were battling Israeli troops on the streets in the city, near the besieged Gaza Strip's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Efforts to reach a truce stalled when Israel began ground operations in Rafah, but US President Joe Biden in late May launched a new effort to secure a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday the UN Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution supporting the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken, in Doha on Wednesday to promote Biden's ceasefire roadmap, said Washington would work with regional partners to "close the deal".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said the group sought "a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal" of Israeli troops from Gaza, demands repeatedly rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan includes a six-week ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner exchange and Gaza reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would be the first truce since a week-long November pause in fighting saw hostages freed and Palestinians released from Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said Israel was behind the plan, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government has far-right members strongly opposed to the deal, has not publicly endorsed it. (AFP)

    Fresh data signals weakness in US jobs market

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A “Help Wanted” sign hangs in a restaurant window in Medford, Massachusetts. There are now signs that the US jobs market is weakening as new claims for unemployment benefits rose. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757342_1_20240613224642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a 10-month high last week, suggesting the labour market was losing momentum and keeping hopes of a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve alive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was reinforced by other data from the Labour Department on Thursday showing producer prices unexpectedly falling in May. The largest decline in prices at the factory gate since last October followed news on Wednesday that consumer prices were unchanged in May. The US central bank on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25 percent-5.5 percent range, where it has been since last July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with policymakers projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists, however, remained optimistic that the Fed would reduce borrowing costs twice this year, starting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These data nudge the door a little wider open for the Fed to start cutting interest rates later this year," said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 242,000 for the week ended June 8, the highest level since last August, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims in the latest week. It was the third straight weekly rise in claims, leading some economists to believe that cracks were forming in the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others blamed the rise on lingering volatility related to the Memorial Day holiday in late May. (Reuters)

 The Chinese University's School of Continuing and Professional Studies on Thursday said the personal information of more than 20,000 students, staff, faculty and visitors has been hacked.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school said it found out last week that its online learning platform had been breached, compromising data such as names, emails as well as student numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was contacting those affected and that their personal details were not appearing on the dark web.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has been notified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school added that it is improving cybersecurity to try to prevent a repeat of the incident.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice said on Thursday that it has filed an appeal against the acquittal of one of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were cleared of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law last month, with three High Court judges saying in their verdict that they were not sure if the pair had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice said it has filed an appeal against Lau's acquittal, but that it won't challenge the judgement regarding Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen others were found guilty of the subversion offence and 31 pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitigation hearings for those convicted will begin later this month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said there are no plans to keep a makeshift hospital in Lok Ma Chau open longer than originally planned, despite its high usage and positive responses from patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital in the Lok Ma Chau Loop area was originally designed to treat Covid-19 patients. It was later turned into a temporary hospital as part of a trial to improve public healthcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The temporary facility began operation in April 2023 and is scheduled to run until 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Sin Ngai-chuen, clinical stream coordinator of the New Territories East Cluster, said the plan is to operate “as long as we can” and follow the directions of the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital, by default, is a temporary building in nature. Of course, it can last for a bit longer in terms of years, but it's not going to be long-lasting because this infrastructure and all the basic facilities are going to be just temporary,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But certainly the result we have obtained here is very encouraging in terms of a pilot scheme. So we will wrap up the findings and experience and we'll try and come up with a possible future development plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital offers a variety of medical services, including diagnostic radiology, endoscopy, drug-resistant organism screening and sleep studies, and is now extending services to include vitamin D pathology tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA said as of the end of May, the hospital had conducted more than 18,000 tests with its medical-imaging services, about 4,000 more than originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median waiting times for patients to get a CT scan, MRI scan and ultrasound scan have all been reduced, from up to 140 weeks to as short as 25 weeks, it noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And about 690 patients have taken part in the sleep studies at the hospital, with the waiting times up to three years shorter than at a general public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sin said the HA will learn from its experience with the makeshift hospital and study the possibility of diverting more patient care to outpatient facilities, to help reduce the pressure on hospitals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the government will ask an independent consultant to investigate CLP power outages over the past three years, and the electricity company will have to pay for the cost of the probe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tse met the managing director of CLP, Joseph Law, after more than 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the frequency of glitches has led to concerns that the service quality of CLP has declined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will hire an independent consultant to investigate voltage dips and power interruptions in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will examine aspects such as safety designs, the power supply system's ability to resist external factors, repair work and preventative maintenance measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will recommend improvement measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EMSD has ordered the company to hand in a detailed report on the Wong Tai Sin outage within a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP, for its part, apologised again for the inconvenience caused by the power outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it will set up a special working group with the EMSD to review how it manages the power system, and a report will be submitted to the government within one year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of Tencent-backed QuantumPharm, also known as XtalPi, on Thursday surged during its trading debut in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It marks the first initial public offering (IPO) under the Hong Kong stock exchange's Chapter 18C listing regime which allows specialist technology companies with a minimum valuation of HK$10 billion to sell shares, even if they haven't generated profits yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shares of the artificial intelligence drug researcher closed at HK$5.8, nearly 10 percent above its IPO price of HK$5.28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Public investors oversubscribed the offer by 102 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the listing ceremony, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Chapter 18C listing regime could facilitate financing for tech companies in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre enables it to attract global capital which in turn supports technology development in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, described the listing as a significant milestone in the city's market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added it showcased China’s leading role in the innovation and technology field and Hong Kong's appeal as a global financing hub for the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to the listing, Image Frame, a Tencent subsidiary, had a stake of about 13 percent in the newly-listed company.

    Six in 10 happy with their family life: survey

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers say socio-demographic factors play a key role in deciding the perceived family happiness in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757289_1_20240613163201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six in 10 people have given positive feedback in a survey of family happiness conducted by Hong Kong University.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The research team, which also includes academics from the department of social work at Baptist University, invited around 4,500 adults to answer an online questionnaire between July and August 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Respondents were asked to rate, on a scale of one to 10, a series of indices, including family "xingfu", a broad Chinese term for happiness and contentment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 58 percent of participants gave a score of seven or higher, compared to a mean of 6.53, the results varied according to their socio-demographic characteristics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher-income individuals and homeowners tended to be more content with their lives, as well as those who were 55 or older.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Kelvin Wang, who led the study, said the findings differed from similar polls such as the World Happiness Report jointly commissioned by the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think (the World Happiness Report) is not able to 100 percent capture the xingfu ... in Chinese groups," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the West, we all know that many things which [people] do are to pursue happiness on an individual level. But for China ... the traditional wisdom is that family is almost in a higher position than individual well-being."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers also compared the results with a separate survey measuring the so-called 3Hs in family life - health, harmony and happiness. They noted a "moderate to high" correlation between the two sets of attributes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang suggested that people make an effort to communicate with their family members and be generous in offering praise, either face-to-face or through instant messaging apps.

    HK's first LPH flats open for application on June 24

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing (LPH) will open for applications from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of modular units for people waiting for public housing was introduced during Chief Executive John Lee's policy address in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters following a media visit to the flats, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said it showed the government's determination in addressing the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is only the first batch. Our target is to provide 30,000 light public housing units by the years 2026 and 2027. All the projects are in full speed. All the projects are being pushed forward on the site," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the flats range from HK$740 to HK$2,650, and tenants were expected to move in as early as the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said priority would be given to families living in poor conditions, based on a points system, adding that people in urgent need were encouraged to submit their applications before July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example families with young children... Many organisations tell us that the changes that can bring to these families are really remarkable and very obvious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because children when they grow up, like from four years old to 10 years old, this is a very critical period...if you leave them in sub-divided units in such a poor condition, it really affects their learning, their growing up and their social abilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister added that people with disabilities, families with infants and the elderly, and those who choose remote LPH sites, would also be given extra marks under the points system.

    CLP urged to explain recent power outages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have called on CLP to give the public an explanation regarding recent power outages in the city, after over 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company says the latest blackout was caused by a faulty cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman who lives in Lung Kwong House said she struggled with the heat when her air conditioning went off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to turn on two portable fans. It lasted for four hours. I was feeling so hot. I haven't experienced such a situation since I lived here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another resident said he couldn't understand why the power company did not activate a backup system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to walk all the way up to my flat. There was no electricity, no air conditioning, and the food inside my refrigerator turned bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said there have been multiple power outages in the city in recent months and this is unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expect the government to try to intervene in the situation and ask the company [CLP] to give us the full report on how to, in the long term, make the power supply become more stable," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not looking into an individual incident. We are looking at a full picture, whether they need some fundamental changes or essential improvements, so that we can guarantee the power supply is stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs, said the threshold in the current penalty system for power companies is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said CLP would face a penalty of HK$20 million if it recorded 15 million minutes of power disruption to its customers in a year. Wednesday night's outage would have caused around one million minutes of disruption, he added.

    Lawmakers welcome East Kowloon transit system plan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday welcomed a proposal for an elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, with the project expected to be completed in 2033.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport and Logistics Bureau submitted a proposal to the Legislative Council on Wednesday to build a seven-kilometre-long system in the area, which would include six kilometres of viaducts and one kilometre of tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The smart and green mass transit system would mainly operate on an elevated corridor, and there would be eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Bill Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, said the elevated mass transit system could solve traffic congestion in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a very, very significant step that the government has already made a decision to satisfy our Kowloon East residents' long-term request to improve our traffic needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan said the network needed to be fully integrated into the areas it served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government must ensure that each station is well connected with the residents, including setting up multiple different entries and also the interconnection system with the related housing estates," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said pedestrian facilities would be built to link the existing Choi Hung MTR Station with the proposed Choi Hung East Station, and Yau Tong MTR Station with the proposed Yau Tong East Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project is expected to be completed in 2033, but Ngan hopes the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government should also look into possibilities of linking the system up with the Kai Tak area, such as Tsz Wan Shan and Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities would seek about HK$262.5 million of funding approval from Legco’s public works subcommittee next Wednesday.

    Hydrogen development plan to be unveiled next week: CE

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee told lawmakers that the government's hydrogen development strategy will be unveiled next week." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757256_1_20240613130238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that officials will role out a development strategy on hydrogen next week, involving the development of hydrogen energy and vehicles powered by the gas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a question and answer session in Legco on the country's initiatives to develop new quality productive forces, Lee said the Environment and Ecology Bureau will announce its hydrogen plan on June 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said some laws may have to be changed to allow the safe storage and maintenance of the gas, which is easily combustible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government will look into new facilities such as hydrogen gas stations, and officials have already approved several pilot schemes involving hydrogen-powered vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We already have [hydrogen fuel cell, HFC] buses on trial now running on the streets, and you will also be seeing the launch of several other projects," the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we have plans to launch a trial project on HFC street washing vehicles, refuse collection vehicles and trams and so on. There will be trial projects too using hydrogen energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive also said the government is facing problems developing a "low-altitude economy", which is currently popular on the mainland, noting that the SAR is filled with high-rise buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB's Elizabeth Quat said there are several things Hong Kong can look into, such as helicopter transit services from the airport directly to business buildings in the Greater Bay Area, local food delivery with drones, and low-flying air tours for travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the legislature also discussed the development of cultural tourism in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Councillor Kenneth Lau, who heads the Heung Yee Kuk, proposed that the government give more funding to rural committees to promote rural cultural activities to tourists, as in-depth cultural tours are becoming more popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee agreed that rural representatives know how to design travel itineraries, and government sponsorship would depend on particular projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, lawmaker Gary Zhang, who used to work at the MTR Corporation, said there are many transport enthusiasts in the Greater Bay Area interested in the local transport culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on the authorities to build an extra rail line connecting the planned Hung Shui Kiu Station with Sunny Bay and the Airport Express, so that travellers can get to Lantau and the airport easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he agreed with connecting the Airport Express to more lines, saying officials will seriously look into whether this would be feasible.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and New Zealand on Thursday signed agreements on trade and climate change during Premier Li Qiang's visit to the country, the highest level Chinese visit in seven years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li also expressed the hope that New Zealand can support Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership when he met Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on the first day of his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the talks, the Premier was greeted on the lawns of Government House in the capital Wellington by Luxon and participated in a traditional indigenous Maori welcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the meeting, Li said that the two agreed that it is important to expand cooperation on trade and investment and that China is ready to be part of New Zealand's efforts to double its value of exports in the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Premier said Beijing will also extend visa-free travel to New Zealanders, while New Zealand will support Chinese language teaching and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agreed that it is important to promote the sustained sound and steady development of China and New Zealand relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to view and handle bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective to lay a solid political foundation of our cooperation in all fields.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said he expressed the hope that New Zealand could support the SAR in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement. Hong Kong officially requested to join RCEP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luxon for his part said they discussed the two country's significant economic relationship, with two-way trade in goods worth nearly 22.4 billion US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and New Zealand have different political systems and as with all of our long standing relationships, it is natural that we will raise our differences with China consistently and predictably," Luxon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li will later visit Australia this weekend and then travel to Malaysia.

    HKMA tracks Fed's decision and keeps rate steady

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The HKMA says the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757245_2_20240613115320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday left its base rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, tracking a decision by the US Federal Reserve to keep its key lending rate steady.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the benchmark interest rate between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, and said there is likely to be only one cut, of a quarter of a percentage point, this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an online press call, Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said the Fed's decision to keep the rate unchanged was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said there is no rush for the Fed to start cutting rates, as there are indications of resilience in the US economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the Fed's perspective, I think they do want to see inflation completely under control, and they would take a lot more comfort to act when the time comes. So I think at this juncture, the market is kind of expecting the first cut to come in September. That is very much in line with the dot plot that was released last night," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said that with recent economic data showing mixed signs and inflation remaining high, it's uncertain when the Fed will start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets continue to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading local banks, including HSBC, Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Standard Chartered, announced they were keeping their rates unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Sze-kei, Head of Wealth Strategy and Insights Division at Bank of China (Hong Kong), said the Fed's decision to maintain its interest rates was to prevent a sharp rebound in US inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung explained that while inflation in the US had been on a downward trajectory, the local job market and economy displayed strength, demonstrating resilience in inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, Cheung said the Fed had adopted a prudent approach in managing interest rates.

 The Boston Celtics took a major step forward towards a record 18th NBA championship with a decisive win over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, taking a 3-0 lead in the series.

  Playing on home court, the Mavericks mounted a spirited comeback in the fourth quarter with Luka Dončić taking 27 points, six assists and six rebounds for the Mavs, while Dallas' Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 35 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Mavericks' attempts to turn the tide, the Celtics managed to hang on for a 106-99 win.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Xinhua commentary says the EU should embrace competition as an impetus for its own development. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757238_1_20240613112719.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry has urged the European Commission to stop turning trade into a political issue and avoid harming mutual trust between China and the European Union, as shares in Chinese automakers ended on a mostly positive note on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The comment from the Foreign Ministry came as the European Commission announced it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported electric cars from China starting in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will take all necessary measures to counter these actions, spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency had earlier said the move by the EU violates the rights and interests of the nation's EV industry and wreaks havoc on the global automotive supply chain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a commentary published late on Wednesday, Xinhua said "the EU's justification for these tariffs are based on claims of unfair competition due to so-called 'distortive' Chinese government subsidies. However, this claim is nothing but a thinly veiled excuse for protectionism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after Washington announced plans to quadruple duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would combat excessive subsidies with additional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes as European automakers are being challenged by an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. Still, there's virtually no support for tariffs from the European auto industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German automakers in particular are heavily dependent on sales in China and fear retribution from Beijing. European auto firms also import their own Chinese-made vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xinhua commentary continued by saying the EU should instead "embrace this competition as an impetus for its own development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that rather than imposing tariffs, the EU should seek collaborative solutions that benefit all parties involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, shares in BYD shot up more than five percent on Thursday on the Hang Seng Index, where carmakers NIO and Geely also ended the day 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent higher. SAIC was down more than 1.5 percent in Shanghai. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    The Green Earth calls for more composting capacity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Founder Edwin Lau quoted current daily composting capacity at being about a fifth of what was required. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757223_1_20240613111509.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of environmental group The Green Earth, Edwin Lau, has welcomed the government's plan to have a food waste recycling bin for each and every public housing block within two years but he says there is still room to expand the composting of waste once it is collected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Lau said government data from 2022 pointed to Hong Kong's daily food waste disposal at being over 3,300 metric tonnes but that current composting capacity was less than 20 percent of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to match both the total amount of food waste collected from the housing estates and also, at the back end, all the facilities or the food waste composting system," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the Organic Resources Recovery Centre at Siu Ho Wan in North Lantau, known as O-Park 1, was currently up and running and that O-Park 2 at Sha Ling in North District was undergoing trial runs before being operational later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two added together will be 500 tonnes of food waste capacity per day. And, besides these two, there are two sewage co-digestion plants operating, that all together total 100 tonnes per day capacity. So you add up all these four facilities and there is a maximum of 600 tonnes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said he thought the government had most likely done the calculation to match the front-end and the back-end to prevent any kind of bottle-neck from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, around 90 percent of public estates share some 700 smart recycling bins, and every estate will have at least one bin by next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment minister Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers on Wednesday that the plan was to match the number of blocks with the same amount of bins within two years. Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year and that more bins would be added to estates where there was strong demand.

    Russian war ships in Cuba on 'routine visit'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Russian navy frigate and a nuclear-powered submarine churned into Havana harbour on Wednesday, a stopover the US and Cuba said posed no threat but was seen as a Russian show of force.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cuba - a long-time ally of Russia - saluted the ships' arrival with cannon fire, while Russian diplomats waved Russian flags and took selfies as the vessels passed the harbour's historic fortresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Admiral Gorshkov frigate, and later the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, half submerged with its crew on deck, were accompanied by a tugboat and fuel ship that had arrived earlier in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four Russian vessels sailed to Cuba after conducting "high-precision missile weapons" training in the Atlantic Ocean, according to Russia's defence ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The submarine and frigate carry Zircon hypersonic missiles, Kalibr cruise missiles and Onyx anti-ship missiles, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cuba said last week that the visit was standard practice by naval vessels from countries friendly to Havana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cuban foreign ministry said the fleet carried no nuclear weapons, something echoed by US officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US said it had been monitoring the Russian vessels as they skirted the nearby Florida coast, but said they posed no threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday such naval exercises were routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen this kind of thing before and we expect to see this kind of thing again, and I'm not going to read into it any particular motives," Sullivan said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Engineering professor and lawmaker William Wong says one of the reasons The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) chose start-up "SmartMore" for its inaugural investment was its plan to base future research in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the financial return, part of it is the promise to create more positions for researchers. The Smart-More company promised to actually establish an research centre, an AI research centre, in Hong Kong and all these things are actually favourable to Hong Kong developing into an international information technology hub," Wong said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government investment vehicle and SmartMore signed a cooperation deal on Wednesday. The company is involved in artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC's CEO Clara Chan has said there will be different investment themes with AI in June, life sciences in July, and new energy technology in August. Professor Wong, who is the associate dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the Chinese University, was also asked for his views on these investment themes and whether they would suit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From this particular case, you can see the government is working very hard step by step... to satisfy the KPIs," he said referring to the investment term 'Key Performance Indicator'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Financial Secretary Paul Chan hailed the partnership between the government-owned investment vehicle and the local tech unicorn, saying it would help boost Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry.

 India qualified for the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket win over the United States on Wednesday, with a fifty by Suryakumar Yadav and Arshdeep Singh's four-wicket haul helping them clinch their third win in a row.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Put in to bat first, the Americans struggled as Arshdeep [4-9] dismissed Shayan Jahangir [0] and Andries Gous [2] in the first over. But Steven Taylor [24] and Nitish Kumar [27] set the stage for a competitive total of 110-8.

  India also struggled at the start, with Saurabh Netravalkar sending openers Virat Kohli [0] and Rohit Sharma [3] back early. But Yadav [50 not out] and Shivam Dube [31 not out] steadied the innings and got India over the line with 10 balls to spare.

  The U.S., second in Group A with four points after suffering their first loss in three matches, will also ensure qualification for the next round if they beat Ireland on Friday. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Merrick Garland is the third US attorney-general to be held in contempt of Congress.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over audio recordings of a special counsel interview with Democratic President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure passed 216-207 on a party-line basis with one Republican joining Democrats in voting no.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice has already turned over a transcript of the interview, which set off a political firestorm in February when Special Counsel Robert Hur released a report describing Biden, 81, as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has asserted that the recordings are covered by executive privilege, and a vote by the House to hold Garland in contempt would put the Justice Department in the awkward position of having to decide whether to prosecute its own leader. It is not required to take up the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garland is the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress, following Democratic President Barack Obama's attorney general Eric Holder and Republican President Donald Trump's Bill Barr. The Justice Department did not pursue charges in either case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Transcripts alone are not sufficient evidence of the state of the president's memory," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said as debate opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representative Jerrold Nadler, the senior Democrat on the panel, countered that Republicans were on a "single-minded quest to follow every right-wing conspiracy theory in the vain hope that it might lead to some evidence of wrongdoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hur, who had investigated Biden after classified documents dating to his time as vice president from 2009-2017 were found improperly stored in his home and office, declined to prosecute the president, saying it was both because he had cooperated with the probe and because he would present a sympathetic face to a jury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's rival in the November 5 election, Trump, has been criminally charged for mishandling classified documents after his 2017-2021 term in the White House, though unlike Biden, Trump refused requests to return the documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congressional Democrats have alleged that Republicans want the audio to use in campaign ads for Trump. (Reuters)

    Nasdaq and S&amp;P hits records for third straight day

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closing highs for a third straight day on Wednesday after inflation data came in softer than expected but the indexes ended off the day's highs as the Federal Reserve projected only one interest rate cut this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fed's March projections included three quarter-percentage-point reductions. The US central bank, in a statement at the end of its June 11-12 meeting, also said it left its policy rate unchanged, as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks were choppy following the news and press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq paring gains late and the Dow finishing near flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks opened higher after the Labour Department reported that the US Consumer Price Index was unexpectedly unchanged in May due to cheaper gasoline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The CPI number was certainly cooler than estimates and drove optimism to start the day but that was only half of today's menu," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James said he would have expected the market to end weaker after the Fed's update, noting that "the commentary was hawkish and rate cut (expectations) were trimmed from three to one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oracle shares jumped 13.3 percent, lifting the market, after the software provider forecast double-digit revenue in fiscal 2025 after the bell on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.09 percent, to 38,712. The S&P 500 rose 0.85 percent, to 5,421 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.53 percent, to 17,608.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just after the CPI report, traders boosted bets for a Fed rate cut by September and another by December.

  Apple's shares climbed 2.9 percent, extending Tuesday's strong gains, and the company briefly once again became the world's most valuable, dethroning Microsoft from the top spot. (Reuters)

    Fed holds rates, expects one cut this year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Fed says interest rate cuts may have to wait until December. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757188_1_20240613021431.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with officials projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for the year amid rising estimates for what it will take to keep inflation in check.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The markdown in the outlook for rate cuts, from three quarter-percentage-point reductions seen in the Fed's March projections, was made despite the central bank's acknowledgement in its new policy statement of "modest further progress" towards its 2 percent inflation target – an upgrade from its May 1 statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It coincided with an increase to 2.8 percent in the estimated long-run, or "neutral," rate of interest, from 2.6 percent, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint in order to finish the battle against rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6 percent versus the 2.4 percent anticipated as of March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation –consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday – but also to steady growth and job creation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) will join a unity government with the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), it said on Wednesday, giving a strong indication of who will govern the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ANC, which lost its majority in a May 29 election but remains the largest party, has been talking to a broad spectrum of political parties to try to set up a government of national unity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final composition of the government has not yet been announced, but the comments by IFP leader Velenkosini Hlabisa gave the most precise picture of how negotiations are shaping up ahead of the newly elected parliament's first sitting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many ANC supporters strongly oppose a coalition with the pro-business DA, which is the largest opposition party but has struggled to shed its image as a defender of white privilege.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have speculated that including the IFP, a conservative party with an ethnic Zulu base, could help temper those concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will participate in the government of national unity for the sake of our country and for the sake of our people, who want life to continue with a stable government that will address their challenges," Hlabisa told reporters at a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokespersons for the ANC and the DA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties have been rushing to reach agreement before Friday, when the National Assembly will meet to elect its speaker, deputy speaker and the country's president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Cyril Ramaphosa is highly likely to be reelected since the ANC has the highest number of seats, but key positions such as speaker of parliament and deputy president are the subject of behind-the-scenes negotiations. (Reuters)

    Macron urges centre to unite; Republicans ditch leader

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday urged rival parties to join his electoral alliance against Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, while the conservative Republicans ditched their party chief for seeking a far-right pact.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fast-moving political developments come after Macron's shock decision to call a snap parliamentary election in a few weeks' time. The vote could hand real power to Le Pen's party after years on the sidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what amounted to a campaign speech, Macron on Wednesday defended his decision to call the snap vote, and urged parties on both sides of the political centre to join him in the battle against the hard right in the June 30 and July 7 elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, who ruled out quitting if his ruling alliance loses, called on "our compatriots and political leaders who do not recognise themselves in the extremist fever" to "build a new project ... a coalition to govern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of the political chaos that Macron's decision has unleashed, the Republicans party leadership on Wednesday decided to kick out their party chief Eric Ciotti after he appealed for an electoral alliance between his party's candidates and the RN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron described such an accord as a "deal with the devil". It would have ended the decades-long mainstream political consensus to block the far-right from power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on X, Ciotti said the Republicans meeting had not followed protocol: "I am and remain the president of our political party, elected by the members!" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron called the election on Sunday after the anti-immigration, eurosceptic RN came out on top in a vote for the European Parliament. (Reuters)

 Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry West, a star guard from the 1960s for the Los Angeles Lakers whose profile on the court inspired the design of the NBA logo, died on Wednesday aged 86.
 <br>
  <br/>
  West played for the Lakers from 1960 until 1974, winning his only NBA title as a player in 1972 while being named as an All-Star for all 14 seasons in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won eight NBA titles as an executive – six with the Lakers and twice with the Golden State Warriors in the Stephen Curry era.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The former head coach of the SAR football team, Jørn Andersen, was on Wednesday confirmed as the new manager of second-tier mainland side Yunnan Yukun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian, 61, quit the Hong Kong, China squad late last month, saying he'd received an offer he "couldn't refuse".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had taken the SAR to its first AFC Cup in more than 50 years, as well as leading the under-23 squad to its first-ever semifinals at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an announcement on social media, Yunnan Yukun described Andersen as an experienced coach with strong leadership skills, saying he can lead the team to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland club are currently leading the second tier of Chinese football, with nine wins from 13 matches for 30 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its former head coach, Li Jinyu, resigned last month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parts of Wong Tai Sin plunged into darkness for four hours on Wednesday evening, with CLP saying a faulty cable was to blame for cutting off power to more than 2,200 customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos on social media showed a number of residential buildings and shopping malls were affected by the blackout at around 8pm. Power was eventually restored shortly after midnight. Temple Mall North, Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate and Mei Tung Estate were among the areas affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said it was very concerned about the outage. "Residents were trapped in lifts and might have an uncomfortable night under this hot weather," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency shelters were set up at Tung Tau Community Centre and Wong Tai Sin Community Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Fire Services Department, there were at least four reports of people trapped in lifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power outage was caused by a malfunction in an 11,000-volt cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm apologised to those affected, adding that urgent repair work was being carried out, with emergency generators taken to the site.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A deadly fire rips through a building housing workers in the southern Kuwaiti city of Mangaf. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757162_1_20240612212703.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that broke out in a building housing workers in the city of Mangaf in southern Kuwait early on Wednesday has killed at least 41 people, the country's deputy prime minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Saud Al-Sabah said during a visit to the site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deputy PM accused real estate owners of violations and greed, saying those factors contributed towards the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, the greed of real estate owners is what leads to these matters," said Sheikh Fahad, who also runs the interior and defense ministries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was reported to authorities at 6am local time, Major General Eid Rashed Hamad said.

  "The building in which the fire occurred was used to house workers, and there was a large number of workers there. Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire," another senior police commander told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always alert and warn against" cramming too many workers into housing accommodation, he said, without providing details on the workers' type of employment or place of origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was contained and authorities were investigating its cause, officials said. (Reuters)

 Swimming star Ariarne Titmus shattered her fellow Australian Mollie O'Callaghan's world record in the women's 200 metres freestyle, clocking one minute, 52.23 seconds just weeks before the defence of her title at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall at Australia's Olympic trials in Brisbane ahead of O'Callaghan, who also went under her previous world record of 1:52.85, finishing in 1:52.48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at the results, it's unbelievable. I'm really happy to finally produce a swim in the 200 that I feel like my training reflects," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Aussie pair will provide Hong Kong's Siobhán Haughey with stiff competition in the race for 200 metres glory in Paris, with O'Callaghan also expected to duel against Haughey in the women's 100 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus has been in top form in Brisbane, swimming the second-fastest 400 metres freestyle of all time on Monday as she also prepares to defend that Olympic title against the likes of Canadian Summer McIntosh and American star Katie Ledecky. (AFP)

    Show of force necessary for absconders: Regina Ip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Regina Ip backed the government's move to impose sanctions against six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences, saying it was necessary to demonstrate to the public that there are consequences for breaking the law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I doubt very much whether these absconders will actually come back to Hong Kong to face the law," the former security minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it will demonstrate to any potential absconders that the government takes absconding highly seriously, and there are punitive measures directed against them if they do run away from the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another former security chief-turned-lawmaker, Lai Tung-kwok, said the purpose of revoking the fugitives' passports was to limit their mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted they could still visit countries using other travel documents, such as a British National (Overseas) passport which is not recognised in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong warned that anyone who joins paid subscriptions of websites or channels run by the six persons may be seen as providing financial aid to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said people may still fall foul of the law by simply "following" such pages, as this may indirectly help the wanted persons generate revenue through advertisements.

    Beijing rebukes additional EU tariffs on Chinese EVs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China vowed to protect its interests if the EU goes ahead with its tariffs on Chinese EVs. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757113_1_20240612162215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday criticised additional European Union tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), saying the move violated market economy principles and international trade rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  MOFA spokesperson Lin Jian said any additional tariffs on Chinese EVs would eventually undermine the EU's own interests, adding Beijing would take all necessary measures to protect its lawful rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's comments came ahead of an announcement by the European Commission that it would apply additional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after the United States quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would set tariffs of 17.4 percent for BYD, 20 percent for Geely and 38.1 percent for SAIC over what it said were excessive subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU provisional duties are set to apply by July 4, with an anti-subsidy investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could apply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission vice president, told a news conference that Chinese-built cars were benefiting from unfair levels of subsidies, threatening EU producers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this basis the Commission has reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss these findings and explore possible ways for resolving the issues identified," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China is strongly dissatisfied with the European plan to impose provisional duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, saying the move ignored facts and World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said Beijing will resolutely take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese companies. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Wednesday said a government taskforce set up to look into a  public spat involving top management at the University of Hong Kong will help with internal communication, rather than investigating specific incidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang and the head of the university's governing council, Priscilla Wong, have been in conflict over senior appointments and management issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday announced the formation of the taskforce, comprising of Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li and head of the University Grants Council Tim Lui. It said their role will include coordinating cooperation and communication within HKU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the pair will contact or meet people involved in the matter, to find out more about the issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group doesn't have a timetable...we hope to gradually show results to the public in the process," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aim is not just to come up with a written report on the matter, we want to play an actual role."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said a tie-up between a government-owned investment vehicle and a local tech unicorn will add momentum to Hong Kong's securities market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Corporation has signed a cooperation deal with SmartMore, a technology company specialising in artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Hong Kong Corporation and SmartMore is a good starting point for advancing Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry towards a brighter future," Chan said in a speech at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the upcoming months, the Hong Kong Investment Corporation will continue to announce more strategic partnerships and actively pursue direct investments and joint investment projects. These projects will encompass various fields, including life sciences, green technology, and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said Hong Kong spent HK$30.1 billion on research and development in 2022, up from HK$21.3 billion in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that there were 4,250 tech startups in Hong Kong last year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he expects each public housing block to have a food waste recycling bin within two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers at a Legco meeting, he said about 700 smart recycling bins for food waste were installed at about 90 percent of public estates across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the smart recycling bins would be installed at all public estates in Hong Kong by next month, which was a month ahead of the original schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added more bins would be installed at public estates, with the goal of installing a bin at each public housing block within two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmakers questioned if the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some old residents told me that there are 11 blocks in their estate, with 380 units, but there are only three food waste smart recycling bins in the whole estate... Can we expedite the process and have one bin in each block within one year?" lawmaker Kitson Yang asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said discussions would be made with the Housing Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see which residential buildings have higher usage of food waste smart recycling bins, and we will install more bins at those estates with higher usage. We will also replace the inner bins of the recycling bins more often to enhance its capacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An insider trading case against Asian hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its British founder Simon Sadler and a former trader has been moved to the District Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Eastern Magistrates' Court approved the prosecution’s request to transfer the case to a higher court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next hearing is scheduled to take place at the District Court on July 2, the court ruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum prison term a district court judge can impose is seven years, versus two to three years for the magistrate's court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case marks a turning point for one of Asia's biggest and oldest hedge funds as well as a step toward heightened scrutiny of trading activities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said last month it had started criminal proceedings against Segantii, its founder and chief investment officer Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca on suspicion of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company before a block trade in June 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accusation relates to insider information about Hong Kong-listed fashion chain Esprit Holdings, the court readout revealed, adding Segantii received the information from Tony Psarianos, a person connected to Esprit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psarianos was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch from 2007 to 2021, according to SFC licence records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, dubbed Asia's "block trade king", is also the owner of his home-town soccer team, Blackpool Football Club. (Reuters)

    Woman loses final appeal over Quarry Bay shootings

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's top court has dismissed an appeal by a woman who was jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle and wounding two other relatives. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757064_1_20240612115331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle lost her final appeal against her convictions for murder on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former bodyguard Tsim Sum-kit also shot and wounded two other relatives in the attack in Quarry Bay Park in 2018, following a family lunch to discuss dividing up the estate of her late grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a High Court trial in 2021, the defence failed to the convince the jury that Tsim had suffered from an abnormality of the mind which resulted in an impairment of mental responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her latest appeal, Tsim argued that the legal requirement for a defendant to prove they suffer from diminished responsibility – if this is to be used as a partial defence to murder – infringes upon the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a written judgement, a panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges said the question of diminished responsibility does not affect the presumption of innocence as it is not an ingredient of the offence a defendant is charged with, but an extenuating mitigating circumstance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said diminished responsibility is a factor that only comes into play if and when prosecutors have proven a defendant's guilt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The partial defence of diminished responsibility does not in any way reduce the burden on the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence of murder," the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is only when a defendant is prima facie guilty of murder that the plea of diminished responsibility becomes relevant. If the prosecution has not already discharged the onus of proving the actus reus and mens rea of murder, the defendant will be entitled to an outright acquittal on the charge of murder and the plea of diminished responsibility will have no further relevance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsim had also asked the court to consider whether the requirement under the Homicide Ordinance for the defence to prove diminished responsibility is proportionate and justified, or whether offering some evidence to support the claim ought to be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this point, the judges said the ordinance has "the legitimate aim of alleviating the prosecution from an unworkable burden arising from the practical difficulties of proving a matter so personal to the accused".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that a number of factors support this conclusion, including "the fact mental disorders and their effects are not part of ordinary life experience of a jury [and] the fact an accused cannot be compelled to be subject to medical examination by the prosecution."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese University’s Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it had identified a new surgery technique that was better at preventing bladder cancer from recurring in patients compared with traditional procedures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three hundred and fifty bladder cancer patients participated in the clinical trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of them underwent a new surgery technique called en bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) and the other half underwent traditional procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Jeremy Teoh, who led the research, noted that the one-year cancer recurrence rate for patients who had received traditional surgery was between 30 and 40 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, Teoh said the recurrence rate in those who had received ERBT dropped to about 28 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Essentially during the [new] surgery, we try to preserve the whole tumour, try not to touch it, avoid fragmentation of the tumour, and also the whole specimen can be retrieved in one piece to ensure a complete resection by histology,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is currently available at 13 hospitals in Hong Kong, including Prince of Wales Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teoh said all bladder cancer patients with a tumour size of less than three centimetres could consult with their doctors about having the new surgery.

    'Retailers must maintain their competitiveness'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Wednesday urged the retail sector to enhance its efforts in maintaining its competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at the Hong Kong Retail Summit, organised by the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Yau said economic activity in the city had returned to normal and tourist numbers were growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau said the retail sector still faced various challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must also confront the various new challenges facing the retail industry, as the preferences and behaviour patterns of tourists - and Hongkongers - are changing," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Retailers must keep pace with these changes, continuously innovate, and adjust their operational strategies in order to maintain their competitiveness and advantage in an ever-changing market environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the summit, the chairwoman of the city’s retail management association, Annie Yau-Tse, said the retail performance in both the tourist and local markets had been disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We [have been seeing] the trend of [budget travel] since last year. That's why we see that the tourists are actually focusing on enjoying their time in Hong Kong, like taking photos, but not really buying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This trend is actually really affecting our industry, because in the past we have been making a lot of business out of the tourists who are actually coming for shopping. But nowadays, you don't really see too many people carrying their suitcases for shopping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau-Tse said retailers in Hong Kong should leverage technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to understand consumer patterns better and create tailored promotion plans to adapt to the changing market dynamics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker and lawyer Holden Chow has accused Lord Jonathan Sumption of "political advocacy" over his comments in an opinion piece earlier this week that commented on Hong Kong's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption, who recently resigned as a judge on the Court of Final Appeal, wrote an article in the Financial Times newspaper entitled "The rule of law in Hong Kong is in grave danger".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=957633&livetime=20240612000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme, Chow said the judge's comments were "grossly inappropriate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow said they would put pressure on the courts when they heard cases, and contrasted Sumption's words with the comments from two other departing justices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Chief Executive John Lee also spoke out over the comments, saying a judge's professional duty is to interpret and apply the law, and that his or her expertise is not on politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the judge had expressed different views a few years ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation held steady in May while producer price declines eased, but the underlying trend suggests Beijing would need to do more to prop up weakened domestic demand and an uneven economic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in May from a year earlier, matching a gain in April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slide in the producer price index eased to 1.4 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, compared with a forecast 1.5 percent decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economy has struggled to gain traction despite the end of stringent pandemic curbs in late 2022, mainly due to the ripple effects of a prolonged property sector crisis on investor, business and consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has rolled out several measures to spur demand in the housing sector and launched other schemes to boost consumer sentiment, including offering government-subsidised incentives to spur trade-ins of cars and other consumer goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also vowed to create more jobs linked to major projects, roll out measures to promote domestic demand targeted for youths and has pledged greater fiscal stimulus to shore up growth. (Reuters)

    Six national security fugitives stripped of passports

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government spokesperson said the six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences has continued to endanger national security after fleeing to the United Kingdom. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757045_1_20240612095301.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people wanted here for alleged national security offences have been stripped of their SAR passports under homegrown national security legislation passed in March.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People will also be barred from providing funds and resources to the six, dealing with assets and property owned by the fugitives, or entering into a joint venture with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those found in violation of the order against Nathan Law, Mung Siu-tat, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng, Johnny Fok and Tony Choi face seven years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mung and Choi have also been temporarily removed from their posts as company directors, while authorities also ordered a temporary suspension of qualification to practise for Fok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said security secretary Chris Tang issued the order against the six according to the national security law, after they fled to the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These lawless wanted criminals are hiding in the United Kingdom and continue to blatantly engage in activities that endanger national security. They also make scaremongering remarks to smear and slander the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More so, they continue to collude with external forces to protect their evil deeds. We therefore have taken such measure to give them a strong blow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Tang said the cancellation of passports did not violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Immigration Department will, according to our law, cancel their passports. And there's a well-established mechanism among different countries regarding how to notify the cancellation of passports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's absolutely no contravention to the covenant... according to all those covenants, there are exceptions because of national security grounds. This is not just applicable to Hong Kong, but applies to all civilised societies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With some of the six active on fundraising platforms, the security secretary warned that people could breach the order by giving monetary support to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an offence to provide funds or to handle funds for those specified absconders, no matter what platform it is," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said authorities must take action against the six, whom he said Britain was harbouring, adding that officials could issue similar orders in future when necessary.

    Ten Hag set to stay on as Man Utd manager

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ten Hag is the first United boss to win trophies in successive seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757040_1_20240612092317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag will remain in the job for next season and has entered into talks with the Old Trafford club over a contract extension despite the team's lowest ever Premier League finish of eighth, British media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision comes after an end-of-season review by the club's board for the 2023-24 campaign, which finished on a high with a shock FA Cup final win over favourites Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's contract runs until the end of next season, with the club having the option of extending it a further 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Ajax Amsterdam coach Ten Hag had come under increasing pressure after 20-times English champions United suffered their worst start to a season since 1962-63 with eight defeats in their first 15 matches in all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They ended up eighth after 14 defeats in their 38 league games and bowed out of the Champions League in the group phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's job security had been the subject of speculation all season and many pundits believed the FA Cup final would be the Dutchman's last game with the team, win or lose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But moments after their thrilling triumph, the 54-year-old insisted he had no doubt he would be back and said he had received the backing of the club's owners all season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm in a project and we are exactly where we want to be. We're constructing a team. When I took over it was a mess at United, and we are on our way to construct a team for the future," he told reporters at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag pointed to United's revolving door of injuries last term, the most of any Premier League team and concentrated in key positions such as central defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also spoke about the breakout seasons of young players such as midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who is part of England's Euro 2024 squad in Germany, and Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Ten Hag's two seasons in charge, United have played in three Wembley finals and lifted two trophies, having also won last season's League Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports said that all eventualities were considered in the club's post-season review and the clear preference was for Ten Hag to remain in charge at Old Trafford. (Reuters)

    Apple pushes S&amp;P, Nasdaq to record highs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered record closing highs for a second straight day on Tuesday, helped by a gain of more than 7 percent in Apple shares, while investors also awaited consumer prices data and a policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apple shares jumped 7.3 percent to a record-high close and gave the S&P 500 and Nasdaq their biggest boosts after the stock declined in the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At its annual developer event that kicked off on Monday, Apple unveiled new artificial-intelligence features meant to increase the appeal of its devices, including an improved Siri virtual assistant that can answer a wider range of queries and accomplish more complicated tasks than earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 technology index climbed 1.7 percent and also posted a record closing high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Price Index report will be released before the bell on Wednesday, and the US central bank's policy announcement is due later the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged but will release its updated economic projections and "dot plot," which shows where policymakers expect interest rates to stand this year and longer-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everybody is feeling uneasy, but the data and actions consumers are taking continue to point toward resiliency, and that tends to be overall fairly bullish," said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and adviser for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31 percent, to 38,747, the S&P 500 gained  0.27 percent, to 5,375 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.88 percent, to 17,344.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  General Motors gained 1.35 percent after the carmaker announced a US$6 billion share buyback plan. GM also cut its annual EV production forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the closing bell, Oracle shares rose 8 percent following the release of quarterly results. The stock ended the regular session down 0.5 percent. (Reuters)

 Hamas accepts a UN resolution backing a plan to end the war with Israel in Gaza and is ready to negotiate details, a senior official of the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Qatari and Egyptian mediators said they had received a formal reply from Hamas to the UN-backed truce proposal, and Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad expressed "readiness to positively" reach a deal to end the war in Gaza in a joint statement on Tuesday.

  However both Israel and Hamas have suggested the plan meets their clashing goals, raising doubts over whether any genuine headway towards a deal can be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hamas response reaffirmed the group's stance any agreement must end the Zionist aggression on our people, get the Israeli forces out, reconstruct Gaza and achieve a serious prisoners swap deal," a Hamas official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discussions also touching on post-war plans for Gaza will continue over the next couple of days, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Tel Aviv after talks with Israeli leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken met Israeli officials on Tuesday in a push to end the eight-month-old Israeli air and ground war against Hamas that has devastated Gaza, a day after President Joe Biden's proposal for a truce was approved by the UN Security Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian residents said Israeli forces operating in the southern city of Rafah blew up a cluster of homes on Tuesday and and an Israeli air strike in a main street in Gaza City killed four people, medics said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's proposal envisages a ceasefire and phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel, ultimately leading to a permanent end to the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri, who is based outside Gaza, said it accepted the ceasefire resolution and was ready to negotiate over the specifics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This required a formula stipulating the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a swap of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinians jailed in Israel, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US administration is facing a real test to carry out its commitments in compelling the occupation to immediately end the war in an implementation of the UN Security Council resolution," Abu Zuhri said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said earlier the Hamas statement was "a hopeful sign" but definitive word was still needed from the Hamas leadership inside Israeli-besieged Gaza. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong ended up bottom of Group E as their World Cup qualifying campaign came to a close on Tuesday with a 0-0 draw away in Turkmenistan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's side ended the competition with two points, the same as Turkmenistan, but with a weaker goal difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile China squeezed into the third round of Asia's preliminaries for the 2026 World Cup by the narrowest of margins despite slipping to a 1-0 loss at the hands of South Korea in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia and North Korea also confirmed their progress to the next round with the national team qualifying as runners-up in Group C behind the South Koreans after Thailand could only register a 3-1 victory over Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Needing to win by three clear goals, or to score at least four with a two-goal victory margin, to climb above the Chinese in the standings, Masatada Ishii's side fell agonisingly short of a spot in the draw for the next round on June 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suphanat Mueanta put Thailand in front eight minutes before the break but Thailand-based forward Ikhsan Fandi levelled 12 minutes after the restart for the Singaporeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A frantic Thailand pushed forward as time ticked down with Poramet Arjvirai and Jaroensak Wonggorn scoring in the last 11 minutes to take their side closer to their target, but ultimately the War Elephants fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had earlier lost in Seoul World Cup Stadium when Paris St Germain winger Lee Kang-in scored from close range in the 61st minute to leave Branko Ivankovic and his players sweating on the outcome of the game in Bangkok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia, meanwhile, confirmed their progress to the third round for the first time with a comfortable 2-0 win in Group F over the Philippines at a buoyant Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan cruised to a 5-0 win over Syria in Hiroshima that fatally damaged the hopes of Hector Cuper's side, who were overtaken in second place in Group B by North Korea as a result of their 4-1 win over Myanmar in Vientiane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia, who had already confirmed their place in the next round, notched up a 5-0 win over Palestine in Perth to finish Group I with a perfect record. (RTHK/Reuters)

    Iceland renews whaling permits despite protests

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iceland has issued a new licence to its sole remaining whaling company, enabling it to continue hunting this season, the government said on Tuesday, drawing a sharp response from campaigners seeking to protect the animals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hvalur hf will be permitted to hunt 99 fin whales in the Greenland and West Iceland region and another 29 in the East Iceland and Faroe Islands region this year, the fisheries ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whaling in Iceland has sparked protests for years from animal welfare campaigners and Hollywood celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision is based on a precautionary approach and reflects the government's increased emphasis on the sustainable use of resources," the ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The whaling season in Iceland lasts from mid-June to late September, with the majority of the whale meat sold to Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's ridiculous that in 2024 we're talking about target lists for the second-largest animal on Earth, for products that nobody needs," International Fund for Animal Welfare director Patrick Ramage said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Icelandic government temporarily suspended hunting for two months after the country's Food and Veterinary Authority reported that the whales' killing time exceeded the limit set by local animal welfare laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only Iceland, Norway and Japan have conducted commercial whaling in recent years, according to the International Whaling Commission's catch list. Despite an international moratorium implemented in 1986 to protect the species from extinction, Norway resumed commercial whaling in 1993 and Iceland in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan withdrew from the international body in 2019 and resumed commercial whaling in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The moratorium allows indigenous peoples in certain parts of the world, like Greenland and Alaska, to hunt whales as whale products play a vital role in their nutritional and cultural life. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire broke out at the Palace of Versailles on Tuesday, forcing the evacuation of visitors from one of France's busiest tourist sites before it was brought under control, a spokesperson said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Palace, built in the 17th century for King Louis XIV, was the main royal residence until the French Revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy in 1789.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firefighters came. There is no more smoke, no more flames and there is no damage to the collection," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire broke out in an area of roofing where renovation works were being done, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than seven million people visit the palace each year. Later this summer it will host the Olympic Games' equestrian events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, a fire consumed the roof of the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. The blaze engulfed the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Around the world, TV viewers watched with horror as the medieval building burned. (Reuters)

    Hunter Biden found guilty in gun case

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury on Tuesday of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 12-member jury in Wilmington, Delaware, federal court found him guilty on all three counts against him, making Hunter Biden the first child of a sitting US president to be convicted of a crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Biden, 54, lightly nodded his head after the verdict was read but otherwise showed little reaction. He then patted his lawyer Abbe Lowell on the back and hugged another member of his legal team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge set no date for sentencing, but added the timeline is usually within 120 days. That would place it no later than a month before the November 5 US presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing guidelines for the gun charges are 15 to 21 months, but legal experts say defendants in similar cases often get shorter sentences and are less likely to be incarcerated if they abide by the terms of their pretrial release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Donald Trump, the first former US president to be found guilty of a felony and the Republican challenger to Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal, accuses Democrats of pursuing that case and three other criminal prosecutions to prevent him from regaining power in his rematch with Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congressional Democrats have pointed to cases including the Hunter Biden prosecution as evidence that Joe Biden is not using the justice system for political or personal ends, having said last week he would not pardon his son if convicted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hunter Biden case was brought by US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weiss has also charged Hunter Biden with three felony and six misdemeanour tax offences in California, alleging he failed to pay US$1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019 while spending millions on drugs, escorts, exotic cars and other high-ticket items.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial is scheduled for September 5 in Los Angeles. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang will kick off an overseas visit this week that takes him to New Zealand, Australia and Malaysia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that the trip will take place from June 13 to 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li’s visit to Australia will extend from Saturday to Tuesday and will be the first by a Chinese premier to the country since 2017, in a further indication that strained bilateral relations are improving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trip comes after China lifted most of the trade barriers it had imposed on Australian exports, including coal, timber, barley and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will hold an annual leaders’ meeting in Canberra during the visit. The premier is expected to visit Adelaide and Perth as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Premier Li Qiang's visit to Australia is an important opportunity to engage directly on key issues for both our nations," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is Australia's largest trading partner and our economic relationship continues to bring substantial benefits to both our countries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese will also raise the case of writer Yang Hengjun who was given a suspended death sentence in China on espionage charges in February, as well as an incident last month where a Chinese military jet dropped flares near an Australian defence helicopter, which the Australian leader said "was dangerous and should never had happened".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Welcoming the Chinese premier to our shores is an opportunity for Australia to advance our interests by demonstrating our national values, our people's qualities and our economy's strengths," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australia continues to pursue a stable and direct relationship with China, with dialogue at its core."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday that Li would visit the country this week, adding that the trip would be a valuable opportunity for exchanges on areas of bilateral cooperation. (Agencies)
