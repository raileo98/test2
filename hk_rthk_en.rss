<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull's Max Verstappen equalled Ayrton Senna's record of eight pole positions in a row with the fastest lap in qualifying for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The late Brazilian's run was set in 1988/89 with McLaren and Verstappen, also a triple Formula One world champion, started his sequence in Abu Dhabi at the end of last season and has yet to be out-qualified in 2024.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Verstappen's 39th career pole came as Formula One marks 30 years since Senna, who had 65 poles, died in a crash at the Italian circuit on May 1, 1994.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a great start to the year and very special," said the Dutch driver after also matching Alain Prost's record 1993 seven successive poles at the start of a season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's 30 years since he (Senna) passed away, so very pleased to get pole and in a way it's a nice memory to him. He was an incredible F1 driver, especially in qualifying," added Verstappen.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 McLaren's Oscar Piastri joined the championship leader provisionally on the front row, with stewards investigating the Australian for possibly impeding Haas's Kevin Magnussen in the first phase of qualifying.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lando Norris, a first time winner at the previous race in Miami, qualified third for McLaren with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completing the second row at the Italian team's home circuit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are getting closer. To be ahead of Ferrari is also a nice result for us," said Norris. "It's going to be close, it's going to be a good race tomorrow.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hopefully it's an exciting one. Tough, especially when the lap times are so tight. A lot of it is down to lap one, strategy and the pit stops." (Reuters)

    Coach De Zerbi to depart Brighton

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Roberto De Zerbi is on his way out of Brighton. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753724_1_20240518231611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton & Hove Albion coach Roberto De Zerbi will leave the club after their final match of the season against Manchester United, the Premier League club said on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 De Zerbi joined Brighton in September 2022 when he replaced Graham Potter and made an instant impact when he secured their highest top-flight finish (sixth) and helped them qualify for European competition for the first time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This season, Brighton reached the last 16 of the Europa League but struggled in the Premier League where they are 10th going into the final day of the season on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Roberto has given us two excellent seasons of service in which he has led the club to new heights, not least our first ever European campaign which will live long in the memory of Albion fans," club chairman Tony Bloom said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have mutually agreed to end Roberto's contract at a time that suits both parties allowing us the earliest opportunity to plan for next season, and Roberto plenty of time to consider his next move and his future."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Italian manager earned plaudits for an entertaining brand of football based on possession while he also nurtured young talents who were able to thrive in his system even as the club lost major players to bigger teams.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am very sad to be leaving Brighton, but I am very proud of what my players and staff have achieved with the support of everyone at the club and our amazing fans in the past two historical seasons," De Zerbi said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have really enjoyed an intense and challenging two years working in the Premier League, not least competing in four major competitions this season. Leaving now provides me with time to take a break before deciding on my future plans." (Reuters)

    Georgia's president blocks foreign agents law

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili says her veto of the bill is legally compliant. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753723_1_20240518231332.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has announced that she has vetoed a draft law on foreign agents, Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zourabichvili had said previously that she would veto the bill, which has sparked street protests, but her decision can be overridden by another vote in parliament, controlled by Georgia's ruling party and its allies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Today I vetoed a Russian law. This law is Russian in its essence and spirit," Tass quoted her as telling a briefing. "It contradicts our constitution and all European standards, therefore it represents an obstacle to our European path."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tass quoted the president as saying her veto was legally competent, and that it would be handed over to parliament on Saturday. "This law must be repealed," it quoted her as saying.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Parliament, is, however, widely expected to overturn the veto.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mass protests have swept through the Georgian capital Tbilisi over the past month since the first reading of the draft law was passed in parliament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The law would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, imposing disclosure requirements and fines for violations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Opponents see the bill as a test of whether the country stays on a path towards integration with Europe or pivots back towards Russia. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Jockey Club on Saturday announced that it's boosting the prize fund for special Snowball draws in its Mark Six lottery, making the big-money jackpots more frequent and larger.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The club said it would start the new arrangements from Tuesday's draw, with more money being held back for the Snowball. It says the number of Snowball draws will rise from about seven per year to 12, while the top prize will be up to HK$100 million for some draws.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The club said in a statement: "The Snowball draw is a major attraction of the Mark Six."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The club said the minimum prize for regular draws would remain unchanged at HK$8 million, while other variable and fized prize allocations would also stay the same.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It noted that the majority of lottery revenue after payouts goes on benefitting the Hong Kong community, with 40 percent of lottery turnover going on taxes or into the lotteries fund.

    Truck driver arrested over light rail incident

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested a truck driver on suspicion of causing a light rail carriage to derail, and disrupting light rail services in the western New Territories for about three hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It is suspected that a plank, measuring 50 centimetres by 20 centimetres, fell from the truck the man was driving onto the light rail tracks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers arrested the 49-year-old man for dangerous driving.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The incident occurred at around 9:40am, when a carriage derailed near Chung Uk Tsuen Station and affected light rail routes 610, 614, 615, and 715.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As a result, services were suspended at Lam Tei, Nai Wai, Chung Uk Tsuen and Hung Shui Kiu stations. But there were no injuries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The MTR Corporation said it's investigating the incident, adding a preliminary investigation found that the train involved was not speeding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Citing sources, lawmaker Gary Zhang, the deputy chairman of the subcommittee on matters relating to railways at the Legislative Council, said the incident happened at a busy crossing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Although the incident is unrelated to the operations and maintenance of the light rail services, I think the MTR Corporation can still use technology to prevent similar incidents from happening again. For example, they can consider installing AI cameras at its junctions, or maybe install some vehicle-based detection systems so that early detections can be done,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zhang doesn't expect the incident to trigger any penalty mechanisms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, the city’s transport chief Lam Sai-hung said that he had expressed concern about the incident.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has conducted an immediate investigation at the scene of the incident and will study improvement measures along with the MTR Corporation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday said there are more companies than ever in Hong Kong, which shows that the city is a vibrant, reliable and convenient place to do business.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said there are over 1.43 million local companies and around 15,000 non-local firms as of April - both record high figures for Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said new companies were emerging, outnumbering those who folded by about 4,600 last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, it said the number of bankruptcy and winding up petitions fell in April.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authorities received 742 bankruptcy and 66 winding up petitions last month. The figures were slightly lower than those in March, but still at least 30 percent up from a year ago.

    'Double peak flu seasons' by two virus strains: doctor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An infectious disease expert on Saturday warned that Hong Kong could be hit by a double whammy in which its peak influenza seasons are dominated by two flu virus strains -one after another this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ivan Hung, who's also a professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that the influenza virus infections have rebounded to a relatively high level in recent time, as residents have low immunity to influenza after three years of the pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said while the peak flu season dominated by the A subtype H-3 virus strain ended last October, infections have continued this year , and the SAR also has to contend with a peak season dominated by the A subtype H1 flu virus strain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In January we have already had the influenza peak season for the subtype H3 virus, and then starting in April and May, we had the peak season that's dominated by the subtype H1 virus.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “While the H1 virus-led inflections might ease from June and July, there's a chance that we might see the H3 virus making a comeback to form another small peak season from August and September ,” he explained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “But I think overall, the H3 virus-dominated peak season might be less serious compared with the one seen last year,” he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The infectious disease expert again called on parents to take their children to get a flu vaccine shot prior to the summer vacation, as there were many serious cases of children infected by the subtype H1 virus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also noted that the city’s Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases had recommended that the Department of Health increase the procurement of the nasal vaccine to raise vaccination rates, as young children were more willing to receive the nasal vaccine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Hung predicted that the new Covid variant - KP.2 strain - that was discovered in the city’s sewage system, will replace the current prevalent variant - JN.1 - as the dominant Covid strain. But he said the new variant will not cause severe cases.

    Cash-strapped arts hub warns of opening restrictions

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The cash-strapped West Kowloon Cultural District on Saturday said the M+ and palace museums may have to restrict the days on which they open unless the government replies promptly to its financial proposals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Henry Tang, who chairs the cultural district authority's board, told i-Cable News that they have already handed in plans as to what to do when the authority's funds are drained next year, but the administration has not responded.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the government should have also completed a study into the authority's finances.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang said the arts hub will run out of money in June 2025, and that it's now taking loans.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If the government delays [giving us a reply], we'll need to take big steps to cut costs. For example, the museums might just open four days a week, instead of six. The Xiqu centre may also open on fewer days," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But will this be fair to the public? After all, this is not a commercial undertaking but a key public policy project."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang added that restricting the days the facilities open will also go against the national policy to establish Hong Kong as a hub for cultural exchange.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He had earlier told local newspapers that they did not wish to request more public money, but could shore up the cultural quarter's finances by selling part of its 40 hectares of land.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said a decision on their funding proposal will have to be made by June to enable contracts to be signed for new exhibitions and projects.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Social welfare lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen on Saturday criticised the government’s latest strategy to ease poverty by saying that such strategies are not “precise” or “accurate” in alleviating poverty as they did not include other groups that also require social support.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His remarks came after authorities earlier identified around 950,000 elderly people, single parent households, and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tik said the latest strategy could not comprehensively reflect the city’s poverty situation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am not against having these target groups, but I think there aren't enough targeted groups, because there are also the disabled, the chronically ill, the mentally ill, and so on. So I think it's not 'broad' enough in terms of identifying the families who need key assistance.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Secondly, the targeted groups are also not 'precise' enough, as it's very general to say that there are over 900,000 people [in these groups], but what about different levels… within them?” he commented, adding that the strategy is not “accurate”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The legislator also believes that the government must maintain and improve the so-called “poverty line”, instead of “abandoning” the gauge, as it could reflect whether those targeted measures to tackle poverty are having an effect.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The ‘poverty line’ uses Hong Kong median household income as the sole gauge to measure poverty. The government earlier said such a gauge is no longer appropriate, and it will come up with a more accurate way of monitoring poverty levels later this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The latest strategy is target group-based, and the poverty line is income-based, these two have different calculation methods and are not comparable,” Tik noted.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Services, which represents some 480 non-governmental social services organisations (NGOs), said some government-led projects to tackle poverty aren't effective enough in offering help.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He cited the “Strive and Rise Programme” the government set up as an example and said that such a project, despite having positive feedback in recent times, is only supporting a limited number of people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “There were about 2,000 pupils covered in the previous cohort under the programme, and about 4,000 covered in the current cohort. All these numbers are far [smaller] compared with poverty figures showing tens of thousands," Chua told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The programme cited was aimed at addressing inter-generational poverty issues by pairing under-privileged students with volunteer mentors - along with financial support:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The government might need to explain to the public why the number of assisted pupils is so small?” he asked.

    Taxi industry has got to change: transport minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said future taxi fleets will have to allow digital payments, install video recording technology, and should respond to complaints.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam told a Commercial Radio programme that he hopes this government initiative to step up taxi management will enhance service standards.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We hope the fleet management will... shift the culture of the whole taxi industry, because we have got to change. If we go on like this, the taxi industry will just get worse and people will have less and less confidence in it," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The official said applications for taxi fleet licences are closing at the end of the month, and the licences will be issued in mid-2024.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the fleets should start operating within a year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Lam said the upcoming taxi fare hike is needed so the industry can stay financially sustainable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said taxi drivers earned HK$17,000 to HK$20,000 a month on average last year, and some of them had seen their income fall.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "After taking into account inflation, some taxi drivers - for example those working on Lantau - earned a lower income than they did in 2019. We think this isn't good for the taxi sector's long term development," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The cost of gas and insurance have also gone up. We considered these factors before reaching the decision."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said they had also considered if people would accept a fare hike, before announcing that flagfall for all taxis will rise by HK$2 from July 14.

    SAR's health sector needs to be 'innovation driver'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau (left) is upbeat on the prospects for the SAR's health and dental sector - as long as it continues to innovate. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753668_1_20240518104520.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau said on Saturday that he's confident that Hong Kong's high quality healthcare and dental services will remain competitive, even though some local patients have been heading north for services on the mainland that are cheaper.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said while some patients think the mainland offers better value-for-money services, the SAR has nothing to worry about so long as the profession keeps improving its services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Professor Lo said on RTHK's Your Home Address programme that as the government seeks to develop the SAR as an international health and medical innovation hub, Hong Kong can also drive advancement in the field.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong has excellent health care service and we have a wonderful university here with a medical school and a dental school. We're not just good in providing service, we should be good in innovation as well," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If we are good, we have all the talents, enough talents, we should actually not be looking just at providing services. We should be driving, we should be the driver for innovation."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The secretary noted that a Hospital Authority initiative to offer medical staff low-interest home loans to retain talent has been going well, with some 80 percent - or more than a thousand applications approved.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lo expressed the hope that upcoming legal changes that would allow more non-locally trained healthcare professionals to practice in the SAR will help ease the staffing shortage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow Jones finished above 40,000 points for the first time on Friday, as stocks were mixed on Wall Street at the end of the trading week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to finish at 40,003.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 percent at 5,303, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,685.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But despite the slight decline in the Nasdaq, all three major indexes still finished the week higher than they were at the start of it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We made a breakout to new record high," said Karl Haeling from LBBW.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The market is just choosing to consolidate, which is probably a healthy thing," he continued. "Because it's racing and getting too exuberant."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, petrochemical producer Valero Energy finished the day up 4.8 percent, while the mining company Freeport McMoRan was up 4.2 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the day's big losers was Paramount Global, which saw its share price fall 4.9 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who attacked the elderly husband of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a hammer was jailed on Friday for 30 years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 David DePape was convicted last year of breaking into the couple's San Francisco home and bludgeoning Paul Pelosi, who is 84.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the time of the October 2022 attack, Democrat Nancy Pelosi was second in line to the presidency and a regular target of far-right conspiracy theories.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jurors heard how DePape – a Canadian former nudist activist who supported himself with occasional carpentry work – had initially planned to target Nancy Pelosi, planning to smash her kneecaps if she did not admit to her party's "lies."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nancy Pelosi was not at home the night of the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prosecutors had asked the federal court in San Francisco to sentence DePape to 40 years in prison. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scottie Scheffler had his mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit, was released, then taken back to the course for breakfast and practice, before finally teeing off. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753637_1_20240518030917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Golf world number one Scottie Scheffler was handcuffed and arrested by police early on Friday after allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while trying to avoid traffic controls outside the PGA Championship at Valhalla.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In one of the strangest scenes ever at a major tournament, Scheffler was taken into custody by police, booked with a mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit, released, then taken back to the course for breakfast and practice before finally teeing off in the second round.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scheffler was detained by Louisville Metro police after he drove onto curbing to try and get around an accident at the entrance of the golf course, one that resulted in the fatality of a pedestrian, and was confronted by police.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scheffler was charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic and released on his own recognisance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While on the driving range preparing to tee off, Scheffler released a statement about the incident.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers," Scheffler said. "It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I never intended to disregard any of the instructions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today. Of course, all of us involved in the tournament express our deepest sympathies to the family of the man who passed away in the earlier accident this morning. It truly puts everything into perspective."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A police report on the incident obtained by ESPN said arresting officer Bryan Gillis says Scheffler disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging the officer to the ground.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gillis was hospitalised with pain, bruising and swelling in his left wrist and knee. An arraignment is set for Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Two-time Masters champion Scheffler arrived at Valhalla's clubhouse about 30 minutes after his release and just under an hour before his start time off the 10th tee in the second round, which began after an 80-minute delay due to the accident.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We were devastated to learn that a worker with one of our vendors was tragically struck and killed by a shuttle bus outside Valhalla Golf Club," the PGA of America said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is heartbreaking to all of us involved with the PGA Championship."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scheffler was driven, by the owner of Valhalla Golf Club according to ESPN, to the clubhouse, where he ate breakfast and changed into his golf apparel before going to the practice range to prepare for his round.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a tough deal," said Scheffler playing partner Brian Harman, the 2023 British Open winner. "But I'm glad to see him."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fans cheered as Scheffler walked through the rain onto the par-5 10th tee and gave him a huge ovation just before he struck his first shot into the right rough on his way to an opening birdie.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scheffler, who won his second Masters title last month, is trying to become the first player since 2015 to win the first two majors in a calendar year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio reported Scheffler was booked into custody by police at 7:38 a.m. before Scheffler's mugshot in an orange jumpsuit was posted by the Louisville Metropolitan Department of Corrections.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ESPN's Jeff Darlington posted a video on X of Scheffler, wearing shorts and T-shirt, with his hands held behind his back, being led away by police in the pre-dawn incident.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Darlington said Scheffler was unaware a person at the entrance was a police officer because they were clad in a yellow rain poncho.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scheffler was the feel-good story of the week at Valhalla, hoping to win his third career major title a week after becoming a father for the first time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His wife, Meredith, gave birth to son Bennett nine days ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scheffler fired a four-under par 67 in Thursday's opening round, but began Friday five strokes adrift of leader Xander Schauffele, the world number three who matched the lowest round in major golf history with a 62 Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scheffler, 27, has won four of his past five starts, capturing titles at Bay Hill and the Players in March, losing in a playoff at the Houston Open, then winning the Masters and Heritage crowns last month. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord coach Arne Slot confirmed on Friday that he would be replacing Jurgen Klopp as manager of Liverpool next season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There hasn't be an official announcement yet – but I don't think it will come as news to you that I will be coach there next season," Feyenoord boss Slot told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UK media said last month that Slot's deal to replace Klopp was worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season before penning a new three-year deal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Klopp will step down at the end of this season after a nine-year reign which brought the Champions League title in 2019 and Premier League trophy a year later.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Initially, Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite to succeed Klopp.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari says they were murdered during the bloody attack on the Nova music festival on October 7.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said on Friday that troops had recovered the bodies of three hostages in the war-torn Gaza Strip who had been "murdered" by their captors on October 7.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Last night, the Israel Defence Forces (army) rescued the bodies of our hostages Shani Louk, Amit Buskila and Itzhak Gelerenter," military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised address.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Israeli citizens "were taken hostage during the Hamas massacre on October 7 and murdered" during the bloody attack on the Nova music festival, he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the festival, which was held near the Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fighters from Palestinian militant group Hamas crossed over and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This terrible loss is heart-breaking... We will return all of our hostages, the living and the deceased alike," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement after the announcement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the around 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 125 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel has launched a retaliatory offensive against Hamas that has killed at least 35,303 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hostages Families Forum said the recovery of the bodies was a "painful and stark reminder that we must swiftly bring back all our brothers and sisters from their cruel captivity."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Louk, a 22-year-old Israeli-German dual national, was identified in online videos showing a woman lying face down in the back of a pick-up truck filled with armed men, before being announced dead later in October.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The last sign of life of Buskila, who was also captured while partying at the festival, was a call to her uncle Shimon, who heard his niece beg her kidnappers not to take her away. (AFP)

 The United Nations warned on Friday that it had only received 12 percent of the US$2.7 billion being sought for war-wracked Sudan, adding that "famine is closing in."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced in Sudan since war broke out in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The United Nations says more than 1.4 million people have fled the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is a catastrophically underfunded appeal," Jens Laerke, spokesman for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Without more resources coming in fast, humanitarian organisations won't be able to scale up in time to stave off famine and prevent further deprivation," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In Sudan, half of the population, 25 million people, need humanitarian aid. Famine is closing in. Diseases are closing in. The fighting is closing in on civilians, especially in Darfur."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The United Nations has expressed growing concern in recent days over reports of heavy fighting in densely populated areas as the RSF seeks control of El-Fasher, the last major city in the western Darfur region not under its control.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Now is the time for donors to make good on pledges made, step up and help us help Sudan and be part of changing the current trajectory that's leading toward the cliff's edge. Don't be missing in action," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shible Sahbani, the UN's World Health Organisation representative in Sudan, said: "Thirteen months of war in Sudan, nine million people displaced which represent around 17 percent of the population and the largest internal displacement crisis in the world today.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This conflict has... nearly destroyed the health system which is almost collapsed now. Close to 16,000 people have died due to this war, 33,000 have been injured," she said, speaking from Port Sudan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sahbani said the real toll was "probably much higher."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The RSF and Sudan's armed forces are seen as both wanting to secure a battleground victory and each side has received support from outside players.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The UN human rights chief Volker Turk this week separately spoke to Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, president of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, Commander of the Rapid Support Forces.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He urged them both to act immediately - and publicly - to de-escalate the situation," UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. (AFP)

    WHO says no medical aid received in Gaza for 10 days

    <![CDATA[<img alt="WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, (far left), says the biggest concern is over the fuel needed to keep clinics and hospitals running. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753622_1_20240517225724.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation said on Friday that it has received no medical supplies in the Gaza Strip for 10 days as Israel pursues a new offensive against Hamas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's closure of the Rafah crossing into Gaza has caused "a difficult situation," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. "The last medical supplies that we got in Gaza was before May 6."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israeli troops entered the city of Rafah on May 7 to extend their offensive against Hamas over the militant group's attacks seven months earlier. They closed the Rafah crossing into Egypt that is crucial for humanitarian supplies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With UN agencies warning of a growing risk of famine in Gaza, the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings from Israel are also virtually shut down.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jasarevic said the biggest concern was over fuel needed to keep clinics and hospitals running. Gaza's health facilities need up to 1.8 million litres of fuel a month to keep operating.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The spokesman said only 159,000 litres had entered Rafah since the border closure. "This is clearly not sufficient," he added, highlighting how only 13 out of 36 hospitals across the Palestinian territory were now "partially" operating.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hospitals still functioning are running out of fuel, and that puts so many lives at danger," said Jasarevic. "Current military operations in Rafah are putting countless lives at risk."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the death of more than 1,170 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures. Out of 252 people taken hostage, 128 are still held inside Gaza, but the army says 38 have died.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 35,300 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the war broke out, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza. (AFP)

    E-CNY pilot scheme expanded to HK for the first time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.

<div class="itemFullText">
 French authorities said police on Friday shot dead a man armed with a knife and a crowbar who was trying to set fire to a synagogue in the northern city of Rouen.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "National police in Rouen neutralised early this morning an armed individual who clearly wanted to set fire to the city's synagogue," Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sources told French media the man "was armed with a knife and an iron bar, he approached police, who fired. The individual died."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Local officials said there were no victims other than the attacker.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The synagogue stands in the historic centre of the city, the capital of the northern region of Normandy that lies along the River Seine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Two separate investigations have been opened, one into the fire at the synagogue and another into the circumstances of the death of the man killed by the police, Rouen prosecutors said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Such an investigation by French authorities is automatic whenever an individual is killed by the police. (AFP)

    Timberwolves crush Nuggets, force Game 7

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Minnesota Timberwolves overwhelmed the Denver Nuggets 115-70 to force the defending NBA champions to a decisive game seven in their Western Conference semifinal series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Anthony Edwards shook off an injury scare to finish with 27 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals as the young, hungry Timberwolves fended off elimination against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets, who had won the previous three games to take charge of the best-of-seven series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jaden McDaniels scored 21 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Minnesota finished with a 62-43 advantage in rebounds and the Timberwolves reserves outscored the Nuggets bench 36-9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Nuggets will host the winner-take-all game seven on Monday, Hong Kong time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm super-pumped for it," 22-year-old Edwards said of the chance to eliminate the Nuggets on their home floor.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But McDaniels cautioned that the Nuggets would be ready as well.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's not over," McDaniels said. "We're just going to try to keep this intensity for the next game."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With their backs against the wall, the Timberwolves absorbed an early punch, falling behind 9-2 before exploding for a 20-0 scoring run.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They out-scored the Nuggets 31-14 in the first quarter, dominating in the paint and winning the rebounding battle 19-9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Denver went nearly six minutes without scoring, the crowd at the Target Center in Minneapolis growing more frenzied as the Timberwolves' lead grew.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another surge by Denver to open the second quarter was quickly repelled with a 13-0 Minnesota run that featured back-to-back baskets from Naz Reid and a three-pointer from Edwards.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Every time the Nuggets looked to be gaining momentum Minnesota responded -- their energy rewarded once again as McDaniels grabbed the rebound from a Reid miss for a second-chance basket at the halftime buzzer, giving the Timberwolves a 59-40 lead at the break.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was pleased with a bounce-back performance from his team.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There were two responses," Finch said. "There was the response to the last three games, but the most important response was when we got down 9-2. And we did a really good job of focusing and coming back with the right energy."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Edwards said he banged his tailbone, but would be ready for Game 7. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian president Vladimir Putin was in Harbin on Friday to promote trade ties between the two nations on the final day of his state visit in China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lying just a few hundred kilometres from the border with Russia, Harbin has long served as a key hub for cross-border trade and cultural exchange.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Russian president attended the opening ceremony of a China-Russia trade expo and was accompanied by Vice President Han Zheng.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at the ceremony, Putin hailed energy ties between the two countries and promised to "strengthen" them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Russia is ready and able to continuously power the Chinese economy, businesses, cities and towns with affordable and environmentally clean energy," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As the world is on the threshold of the next technological revolution, we are determined to consistently deepen bilateral co-operation in the field of high technologies and innovations," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday on his first trip abroad since his March re-election, meeting President Xi Jinping for talks in which the leaders framed their nations' ties as a stabilising force for the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two men later ditched their ties for a less formal meeting over tea at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Footage from broadcaster CCTV also showed the leaders embracing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An editorial in the Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties between the two countries, saying China had been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 straight years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavourable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship," the editorial said. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer who was earlier found guilty of mortgage fraud involving more than HK$26 million was sentenced on Friday to six and a half years in jail.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Superintendent Harbour Chan was convicted in April of two counts of fraud in connection with two mortgage applications made in 2019 involving a luxury house in Tai Po and a flat in Tung Chung.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Co-defender former chief inspector Wong Ho-ngai was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for one count of fraud.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In mitigation, Chan's lawyer requested the court to consider an appropriate reduction in sentence given that the defendant grew up in a less privileged family and his enthusiasm in participating in public welfare activities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Deputy District Judge Edward Wong said the sentencing starting points for the two charges were set at six and a half years and three and a half years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Considering the defendant's good personal background and special social contributions, a discretionary reduction in sentence was granted, resulting in a sentence of six and a half years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said it has given conditional approval to the environmental study into a plan to turn fish ponds in the northern New Territories into a technology hub.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The department's director, Samuel Chui, said the environmental impact assessment on the San Tin Technopole project took into account a large number of ecological survey findings, and officials did not receive any feedback concerning issues the report did not cover.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The report is scientific, professional and comprehensive. And it doesn't underestimate the ecological value of the area being studied," he told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chui added that amendments to the report submitted by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), such as birds' names and photos as well as a draft plan to create habitats for animals, did not affect the effectiveness of the study.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said conditions for the approval include that the CEDD has to submit detailed designs for the project and that it must refrain from filling in fish ponds in the area before creating a new one in a conservation park.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chui said the CEDD also needs to set up a panel, consisting of green group members and government representatives, to monitor the development's impact on the environment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The committee will work together to give the best environmental protection," he said. "Just like this time, we have heard many proposals and we will discuss and find the best way to protect the environment and also to conserve the species and the ecology in the area."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chui said the CEDD is taking measures to protect Eurasian Otters, a species of conservation importance. The animals were recorded back in 2019, but were not found during a recent ecological survey.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the department is adopting suggestions from green groups on building passages for the otters, as well as improving the design of buildings so birds will not crash into them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Development Bureau, for its part, welcomed the approval, saying it provides a solid foundation for the government to proceed with the next stage of the town planning process and commence the project as scheduled.

    Surveyors suggest ways to improve subdivided units

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kenny Tse (right) says owners bear the responsibility of improving subdivided units as they are earning money from them. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753545_1_20240517133008.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A minimum area of at least 100 square feet, including the toilet and kitchen, as well as ensuring proper ventilation and drainage, were among the recommendations made by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors in its report to a government task force on subdivided units.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Various fire protection measures should also be implemented, the institute noted, including no open flame cooking, partition walls installed between units that could block fire for at least one hour, as well as providing a clear fire escape route.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Other recommendations include having at least one openable window towards open space and separating the kitchen and toilet properly.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The institute estimated that about 30 percent of the 110,000 subdivided flats in the city do not meet these minimum standards and require improvements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kenny Tse, who chairs the institute’s Building Policy Panel, said that generally it would only cost owners tens of thousands dollars to improve their flats, adding that almost all upgrades could be carried out without affecting the building's common area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “All the proposed enhancements should be carried out within the subdivided units, not related to the common areas. For example, the fire service installation, we only need to buy a fire extinguisher, smoke detector or something like that,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “For the drainage part. This is the only one they need to connect to the common drainage pipe, but I think that this is feasible and also easy to carry out."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The institute also proposed a registration system for subdivided flats, saying owners must entrust professionals to inspect and accredit the units. Such inspection has to be conducted every three years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But it said owners of sub-standard units should be given 12 months to make improvements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We have to take care of the over 100,000 subdivided units in existing markets and we think that we cannot treat the 100,000 subdivided units at one time,” said Nathan Lee, who heads the institute’s Building Surveying Division.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “So we should allow some time for the owners to take care of the existing tenants and also provide some relocation for the existing tenants. So we propose 12 months for the modification period.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The institute added these were just temporary solutions and the ultimate solution to the subdivided unit issue remained increasing public housing supply.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said they were concerned about growing congestion around the Western Harbour Crossing, after changes to tolls made it the busiest of the three harbour tunnels.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Official figures show that since a shake-up of tolls in December, traffic flow at the Western Harbour Crossing has increased by 18 percent to around 103,000 vehicles a day, with queues at peak times getting longer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acting Deputy Commissioner for Transport Leung Sai-ho said officials are planning to construct an additional lane at the exit of the tunnel on the Hong Kong Island side.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Indeed, there's a bottleneck area... I'm sure the project will have a positive impact on the traffic queue and the vehicle speed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If we can increase the capacity of the road section, we believe this can improve the overall performance of the Western Harbour Crossing."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Work on the extra lane is expected to begin in the second half of 2025 and to be completed by 2027.

    HK court delays Country Garden hearing till June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition seeking liquidation of Country Garden. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753541_1_20240517125904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)

    'China to play mediating role in Ukraine conflict'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin attend a tea ceremony in Beijing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was on Friday wrapping up his two-day state visit to China with a trip to the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties with Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He will join trade and investment talks there a day after a meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who told him that China-Russia relations should be "cherished and cared for" by both sides.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two also discussed the conflict in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And hours after Xi and Putin met, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that China could not "have its cake and eat it too" with regard to the West and Moscow.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It can't have it both ways and want to have [better] relationships with Europe and other countries while simultaneously continuing to fuel the biggest threat to European security in a long time," Patel said, referring to the Ukraine conflict.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Alan Lung, a political analyst and Co-convenor (International) of the Path of Democracy think tank, said he believes that China is looking to play a mediating role in the Ukraine conflict.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are only two countries in the world that doesn't need another country and that is the US and Russia because of its vast territory, but China cannot do that," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China has bigger stakes and has to cooperate with the West, and this is why China, I think Xi Jinping, desperately wants to, if possible, broker peace in Ukraine on behalf of Russia, on behalf of the Europeans."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the same programme, Brian Yeung, who wrote a book on his time working in Russia, said he thinks China would not want the situation in Ukraine to undermine its ties with Europe.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China might be the only, or at least the most important strategic partner to Russia," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Recently, Xi Jinping also visited Europe and had a very fruitful conversation with the French president. That also signals that China doesn't really want to mess up with Europe for the sake of the China-Russia relationship."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xin Zhang, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, said there are mixed opinions over the ongoing conflict, with some supporting Russia's narrative that the military operation is justified.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are also those who are very much on the pro-Ukraine side, looking at this as essentially a big power exploiting a small neighbouring power," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The situation is complicated. There was a long, complicated historical cause for this conflict to escalate to such a degree. I try to emphasise that China is not the direct party in the conflict, and we would love to see a peaceful resolution through political negotiation."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials on Thursday said at least four people were killed in Texas as heavy storms with winds up to 160 kilometres per hour lashed the US state.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Streets in downtown Houston were covered in glass from blown-out windows, video and photos posted to social media showed, as the National Weather Service warned of "severe" thunderstorms and possible tornadoes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Downed trees and power lines littered residential areas, and around a million customers in the state had lost power -- including more than 800,000 in Harris County, where Houston is located.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The mayor of Houston, John Whitmire, urged residents to avoid downtown, adding that public schools would be closed on Friday and asked non-essential workers to stay home as well.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The mayor and the city's office of emergency management (OEM) were working with first responders to assess the damage, the city said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Residents were asked to stay off the roads and avoid unnecessary travel, according to the OEM. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's lawyer attacked the credibility of key witness Michael Cohen during a wide-ranging cross-examination Thursday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753520_1_20240517112333.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's lawyers accused the star prosecution witness in his hush money trial of lying to jurors, portraying Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen on Thursday as a fabulist who was bent on seeing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee behind bars.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Defence attorney Todd Blanche pressed Cohen for hours with questions that focused as much on his misdeeds as on the case's specific allegations and tried to sow doubt in jurors’ minds about Cohen’s crucial testimony implicating the former US president.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Over the past couple of days, Trump's defence team has attempted to portray Cohen — a onetime Trump loyalist who has become one of his biggest foes — as a media-obsessed opportunist who turned on the former president after he was denied a White House job.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Whether the defence is successful in undermining Cohen's testimony could determine Trump's fate in the case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Over the course of the trial's fourth week of testimony, Cohen described for jurors meetings and conversations he said he had with Trump about the alleged scheme to stifle stories about sex that threatened to torpedo Trump's 2016 campaign.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump, who insists the prosecution is an effort to damage his campaign to reclaim the White House, says the payments to Cohen were properly categorised as legal expenses because Cohen was a lawyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump's legal defence has suggested the former president was trying to protect his family, not his campaign, by squelching what he says were false, scurrilous claims. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reddit has partnered with OpenAI to bring its content to popular chatbot ChatGPT, the companies said on Thursday, sending the social media platform's shares up 12 percent in extended trade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The deal underscores Reddit's attempt to diversify beyond its advertising business, and follows its recent partnership with Alphabet to make its content available for training Google's AI models.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ChatGPT and other OpenAI products will use Reddit's application programming interface, the means by which Reddit distributes its content, following the new partnership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 OpenAI will also become a Reddit advertising partner, the company said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ahead of Reddit's March IPO, Reuters reported that Reddit struck its deal with Alphabet, worth about US$60 million per year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Investors view selling its data to train AI models as a key source of revenue beyond Reddit's advertising business.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The social media company earlier this month reported strong revenue growth and improving profitability in the first earnings since its market debut, indicating that its Google deal and its push to grow its ads business were paying off.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Reddit's shares rose 10.5 percent to US$62.31 after the bell. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is up nearly 12 percent since its market debut in March. (Reuters)

    Violence continues in New Caledonia

<div class="itemFullText">
 The French government sent more police to the Pacific island of New Caledonia on Thursday and said it would crack down on rioters, hoping to restore order after three nights of upheaval in which four people have been killed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rioters angry with an electoral reform have burnt businesses, torched cars, looted shops and set up road barricades, causing a "dire situation" for access to medicine and food in the French-ruled Pacific island, authorities said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Everything's burning, people have literally no limits," New Caledonia student Olivia Iloa said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 France has declared a state of emergency on the island, put at least 10 people under house arrest and banned TikTok. Numbers of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia will rise from 1,700 to 2,700 by Friday evening, with a small number of soldiers assisting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The situation in New Caledonia remains very tense, with looting, riots, fires, attacks which are unbearable," French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told reporters. France will "show the utmost firmness towards looters and rioters" and toughen sanctions, he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rioting erupted over a new bill, adopted by lawmakers in Paris on Tuesday, that will let French residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years vote in provincial elections. Some local leaders fear the move will dilute the indigenous Kanak vote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Electoral reform is the latest flashpoint in a decades-long tussle over France's role in the mineral-producing southwest Pacific island some 1,500 km east of Australia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government in Paris repeated past mistakes by not heeding warnings over the reform, said Dominique Fochi, secretary general of the Caledonian Union, a branch of the pro-independence FLNKS party which has called for calm but wants the reform shelved.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We spoke in the void, and now things have exploded," Fochi said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 France annexed New Caledonia in 1853 and gave the colony the status of overseas territory in 1946. New Caledonia is the world's No 3 nickel miner but its nickel industry is in crisis. Economic disparities also fuelled the riots, said Fochi. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chilean 21st seed Nicolas Jarry fought back from a set down to beat world number eight Stefanos Tsitsipas 3-6 7-5 6-4 and reach the Italian Open semi-finals on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jarry, who fought off 11 of 13 break points faced in the match, will next play American 14th seed Tommy Paul on Friday in his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another Chilean, Alejandro Tabilo will take on German third seed Alexander Zverev the other semi-final. Two Chileans will appear in the semi-finals of an ATP 1000 event for the first time since the format was introduced in 1990.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jarry was tested in the opening set by Greece's sixth seed but gained his momentum in the second.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 28-year-old won five consecutive points at 3-3 as he bounced back from 0-40, before wrapping up the second set by winning nine of the final 11 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jarry then broke Tsitsipas in the decider for a 5-4 lead to eventually cruise into the last four.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier on Thursday, Paul came through a marathon match to beat Polish seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz 7-5 3-6 6-3 to book his spot in the semi-finals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The American, who defeated defending champion Daniil Medvedev in the previous round, had yet to drop a set before the quarter-final, but Hurkacz managed to force the match into the decider before Paul came out on top.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was a match which went back and forth with 13 breaks of serve overall. The pair exchanged breaks early in the opening set, with Paul breaking twice to lead 3-2. With Paul serving for the set, Hurkacz broke again to make it 5-5.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Paul broke back immediately and held serve to take the first set. The American made a strong start to the second, breaking in the first game, but Hurkacz came back, breaking twice to force a third set.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This time it was the Pole who took an early 2-0 lead, but they again exchanged breaks of serve to make it 3-3 before Paul made the decisive break to go 5-3 up, and then saved six break points to wrap up victory. (Reuters)

    Schauffele equals major record low round to lead PGA

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xander Schauffele smiles on the eighth green. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753487_1_20240517073357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele set the early target at the PGA Championship, firing a record equalling opening round nine-under 62 at Valhalla Golf Club on Thursday as the Olympic champion looked to atone for a shock loss at the Wells Fargo.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Schauffele, who held a final round two stroke lead at Quail Hollow on Sunday before losing by five shots to Rory McIlroy, was a man on a mission in Louisville and he matched the men's major championship low score – for the second time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite an Olympic gold medal in Tokyo and an proven ability to go low, the 30-year-old American has yet to win a major and is without a win since the 2022 Scottish Open.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While there is a lot of golf to be played, the world number three signalled he plans to end both droughts with a brilliant error-free opening round that matched his first round effort at last year's U.S. Open.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'll take a 62 in any major any day," said Schauffele. "Not winning makes you want to win more, as weird as that is.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The top feels far away, and I feel like I have a lot of work to do."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Perhaps, but Schauffele's 62 will be tough to beat on a sunny day at Valhalla. He is sitting in the clubhouse a comfortable three shots clear of Tony Finau and Sahith Theegala on six-under 65.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lurking four off the pace on five-under are red hot world number two McIlroy and Scotsman Robert MacIntyre.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 McIlroy, coming off back-to-back PGA Tour wins, carried that momentum into the first round. He rolled in a six-footer for a birdie on his opening hole, the par five 10th, then picked up a second at the 13th to briefly join a crowd at the top of the leaderboard.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the Northern Irishman, who announced on Monday that he had filed for divorce, stalled after the early burst. He took a bogey at the 17th before hitting his stride again after the turn by carding four birdies, including three straight from the fifth coming home.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Defending champion and LIV Golf standard bearer Brooks Koepka, bidding to become the tournament's first repeat winner since he retained the title in 2019, looked a threat to add a fourth Wanamaker trophy to his collection after returning a four-under 67 highlighted by an eagle, birdie, par finish.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tiger Woods, who collected one of his 15 major titles at Valhalla in 2000 with a playoff win over Bob May, opened with a one-over 72 but lamented a sloppy bogey, bogey finish to his day. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished modestly lower on Thursday, retreating from a record run that included the Dow's first ever rise above 40,000 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow lingered above that level for hours before ending slightly lower.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We had a big move yesterday in response to data that were friendly for the Fed," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Today there was this absence of any major catalyst," he said. "With stocks at all-time highs, I think taking a breather is healthy."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,869.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 5,297, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 percent to 16,698.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All three indices finished at records on Wednesday following data showing a cooling in US inflation that raised hopes of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Walmart shot up 7.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as the retail giant pointed to gains from wealthier consumers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Deere & Company dropped 4.7 percent as it projected broad-based 2024 sales declines in light of a tough operating environment in the farming economy. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia does not have sufficient forces on the ground to make a major breakthrough in Ukraine after launching an offensive in the Kharkhiv region, a top Nato commander said on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Russians don't have the numbers necessary to do a strategic breakthrough... more to the point they don't have the skill and the ability to do it," US General Christopher Cavoli, Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told journalists.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I've been in very close contact with our Ukrainian colleagues and I'm confident that they will hold the line," Cavoli said after Ukraine's military briefed Nato's top brass.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ukraine said on Thursday it was trying to "stabilise" the front line in the northeast Kharkiv region, where Moscow has made its largest territorial gains in 18 months after launching a fast-moving offensive last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was sending yet more reinforcements to the area, and the Ukrainian army said it had managed to partially halt Russia's advance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Moscow has seized 278 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory between May 9 and 15, according to calculations based on data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) – the largest territorial gain in a single operation since mid-December 2022.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cavoli said Ukraine's allies were speeding major deliveries to Kyiv's forces after Washington passed a major aid package following months of delay.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They're being shipped vast amounts of ammunition, vast amounts of short range air defence systems and significant amounts of armoured vehicles right now," he said. (AFP)

    US proposes reclassifying marijuana as low-risk drug

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden says nobody should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753469_1_20240517022033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden's administration formally proposed on Thursday reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a historic shift that would bring federal policy more in line with public opinion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "No one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. Period," Biden said in a video statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Far too many lives have been upended because of a failed approach to marijuana and I'm committed to righting those wrongs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marijuana has been classified since 1970 as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) along with heroin, ecstasy and LSD, meaning it is deemed to have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But it would be downgraded to a Schedule III drug under the proposal, along with drugs like ketamine and painkillers containing codeine, with a moderate to low likelihood of dependence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The proposal to reclassify cannabis was unveiled by the Biden administration at the end of April and the Justice Department officially launched the process on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marijuana will remain a controlled substance until the process – which includes a public comment period and a potential hearing before a judge – is complete.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2022, Biden became the first president to initiate a federal review of marijuana policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The issue is seen as a potential vote winner for Biden as he faces Republican Donald Trump in a tough election rematch this November, especially among younger people whom the Democratic incumbent is struggling to court.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Pew Research Centre survey found 88 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legal for medical or recreational use. Just 11 percent said it should not be legal at all.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cannabis was first outlawed at the federal level in 1937, a decision critics say was made largely along racist reasoning, as the drug was perceived as being intimately tied to jazz music and to Mexican immigrants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 1970s brought the "War on Drugs," which likewise disproportionately hit minorities – before the medical marijuana movement took root in the 1990s, and in 2012, US states began to make recreational cannabis legal for adults.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cannabis is today a multi-billion-dollar business in the United States, with more than half of all states having legalised recreational and medicinal cannabis use, including California and New York.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But since the drug remains a controlled substance at the national level, everyone involved is still technically breaking the law of the land.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The classification makes it difficult for businesses to access banking services, stops federal funding for medical marijuana research and prevents interstate commerce, as well as federal regulation on best practices and protocols for marijuana. (AFP)

    US military says aid will flow into Gaza soon via pier

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The US military says thousands of tons of aid will soon be arriving at the floating pier. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753465_1_20240517003554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US military said on Thursday it expected around 500 tons of aid to enter Gaza in the coming days after an emergency pier was affixed to the shore in the war-ravaged territory.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Just a few hours ago, the pier was successfully affixed to the beach in Gaza," said Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think we're going to get about 500 tons in in the next couple of days. It's a pretty substantial amount, and it's spread out over multiple ships right now," Cooper told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The humanitarian assistance is being screened in Cyprus and loaded by truck. Once on land, it will "move quickly," being offloaded from the coast into Gaza within hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Thousands of tons of aid are in the pipeline. We're seeing significant volumes of aid flow into Cyprus for further distribution," he told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 President Joe Biden announced the emergency pier in March to address the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, where the United Nations has warned of famine with virtually the entire population displaced by the Israeli military action in response to the October 7 Hamas attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Built at a cost of at least US$320 million, the project is extraordinary in that such massive humanitarian efforts by the United States are usually in response to actions by hostile countries, not a US ally.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The United States said it had coordinated the effort with Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cooper said that around 1,000 US soldiers and sailors were involved in the operation but that they were only involved in the pier and not in delivery – which will be handled through the United Nations – or in combat between Israel and Hamas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There will be no US military boots on the ground in Gaza," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Three additional US military ships will join the relief effort in the coming days, with Britain also providing a vessel, Cooper said. (AFP)

 Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson will miss Sunday's concluding game of the Premier League season and next week's FA Cup final, the club announced on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Brazilian was forced off with a facial injury during City's 2-0 win over Tottenham on Tuesday that left Pep Guardiola's men on the brink of an unprecedented fourth successive English top-flight title.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scans have confirmed Ederson suffered a small fracture to the right eye socket following a collision with Cristian Romero.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He will now miss Sunday's league game at home to West Ham and the FA Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley the following week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City, two points clear of Arsenal, will guarantee the Premier League title if they beat West Ham at the Etihad. (AFP)

    'Green finance to help HK develop hydrogen energy'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Thursday said Hong Kong, being an international financial hub, can speed up the development of hydrogen power through financing initiatives that invest in green and sustainable sources of energy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Civic Exchange made the recommendation in its study of the clean energy source, before the government publishes its strategy on the topic in the first half of 2024 in a bid to de-carbonise the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The think tank's research analyst Wing Tsang said the recently released Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance would make it easier for businesses to identify and invest in green hydrogen projects which were completely zero-carbon.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said the SAR could also learn from South Korea, where green bonds are issued to finance hydrogen infrastructure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong is an international financial centre, [we] can line up with the banking institutions, the financial institutions, businesses and the government to make the hydrogen transition happen," she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tsang added the government also needs to address the high costs and insufficient infrastructure of hydrogen energy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong currently has no secure and stable supply of hydrogen, and we must identify available sources of hydrogen locally and in close proximity to Hong Kong to propel the application of hydrogen."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The think tank also urged authorities to approve more pilot projects to speed up the development and adoption of hydrogen energy in the city.

 Police on Thursday said a 13-year-old girl was arrested for allegedly wounding a boy with a 30-centimetre-long fruit knife at a Tuen Mun secondary school.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers said they received a report at about 4pm that the suspect attacked the 13-year-old boy, after the two had an argument over trivial matters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The victim suffered shoulder, back and hand injuries, and was sent to Tuen Mun Hospital for treatment.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Slovak interior minister on Thursday said that a “lone wolf” had been charged with attempted murder in the shooting that seriously wounded Prime Minister Robert Fico.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico was in serious but stable condition on Thursday, a hospital official said, after the populist leader was hit multiple times in an attempt on his life that shook the small country and reverberated across the continent weeks before European elections.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The attempted assassination shocked the small central European nation, with many blaming the attack in part on extreme political polarisation that has divided the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok on Wednesday said that an initial investigation found “a clear political motivation” behind the attack on Fico while he was attending a government meeting in a former coal mining town. However, he clarified this on Thursday, saying the suspect charged was a lone wolf who “did not belong to any political groups". (AP)

    New law proposed to help contractors get paid on time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau on Thursday proposed legislation to make it easier for contractors in the construction sector to get paid on time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill would allow a contractor to claim payment every month, even if it's not specified in their contract.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That's a change from the current situation, under which disputes are normally settled only when a contract ends.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill would also create a new mechanism for settling disputes. A claimant would be able to take their case to an adjudicator, who would make a decision within 55 days.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If payment doesn't arrive, the claimant would be able to suspend or slow down work, and extend the construction period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said it wants to see disputes settled sooner, so everyone involved can get their money faster. It said contractors should see their finances improve, so they can pay workers on time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials expect the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to pass later this year and to take effect next year.

    'Social workers may be banned for life by convictions'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun stressed to lawmakers that social worker licencing decisions will still be made by the sector's regulatory body in futre." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753418_1_20240516165846.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said social workers could in future be banned from the profession for life, if they were convicted of a crime which could warrant a prison sentence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It is among a series of proposed legal changes the administration said would improve the statutory body overseeing the profession, as it accused the body of deviating from the spirit of the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials want to reform the Social Workers Registration Board such that there'd be more appointed members than elected ones, while in future, all 27 board members would need to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Under the plan, social workers convicted of lesser offences that may be considered to harm the reputation of the profession would also be subject to a permanent expulsion, or a ban of no more than five years as decided by the board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The person concerned could write to the board within 28 days to oppose the decision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As for more serious crimes such as national security offences, murder, sex offences and child abuse, the board would promptly expel the social worker unless the whole board votes otherwise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Thursday described the proposals as nothing major, stressing that deregistration decisions would continue to be made by the board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We're not amending such broad principles [over deregistration]. What we're saying is that we mustn't and shouldn't wait, and there's a new provision to allow for the prompt removal," he told lawmakers at a special Legco panel meeting on the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun also accused the current board of dereliction of duty for not taking any steps to implement legal changes related to national security.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said it should have actively gathered information on whether social workers seeking to renew their licences "may have committed security-related crimes".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Still, New People's Party's Judy Chan expressed concern that social services would be under affected after the changes, saying there might be a scenario where a group of social workers were disqualified.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister dismissed this, saying he thinks most social workers shouldn't have a problem getting their licences renewed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun also stressed the legal amendments only require future board members to take an oath, rather than all registered social workers.

    Govt unveils new measures to cope with extreme weather

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced a series of measures intended to help Hong Kong cope better with extreme weather, including new arrangements for MTR services when the second-highest typhoon signal is in force.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trains on overground sections of the network will continue until the end of the line, or at least to a large station where passengers can take shelter, instead of only stopping at the next station when the No 9 typhoon signal is in force.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, scores of travellers were left stranded at the the airport when Typhoon Koinu forced the suspension of the Airport Express and all bus services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In case the train is already in this open section, we will try to reach the final destination as far as practicable and safety permitting," Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said at a cross-departmental press conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If not, we're now planning to stop at a major station in which that station may be big or may be connected to the mall or other commercial areas so that people or passengers could have a better place for shelter so that they can depart the area when the weather allows."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk warned that people who deliberately and repeatedly put themselves in jeopardy during extreme weather may face fines or even prison.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheuk gave the example of people going onto beaches that are closed, adding that the risk is simply not worth it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "What we're aiming to do is dissuade people from having some sort of high risk, very risky activities. If anything happens, it's not just costing them HK$2,000 or 14 days in prison. It will cost their life. It's also endangering the life of my emergency response officers. So what we're saying is do not do something dangerous. Do not put yourself at risk," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheuk also said the observatory will issue advice and warnings to members of the public during adverse weather, adding that a city-wide SMS alert system is only reserved for "unforeseen situations" such as tsunamis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Asked about arrangements when water is discharged from the Shenzhen Reservoir, officials said they will alert Hongkongers as soon as authorities across the border start considering such a move.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Children’s Hospital on Thursday said it would open the SAR's first breast milk bank next year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It would collect milk from breastfeeding mothers who produce surplus milk, which would then be used to help premature and critically ill babies whose mothers were unable to breastfeed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bank would only accept donations from healthy mothers who don't smoke.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Dr Lee Tsz-leung, the hospital's chief executive, said the donated breast milk would benefit the health of premature babies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It carries significant benefits for pre-term babies. It will reduce complication. It will reduce mortality rate. It will reduce the length of stay in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and also it will promote the neurological development of these premature babies as well," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The aim is to collect about 800 litres of milk each year, which would benefit up to 600 newborns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday said many mosquito repellents may not deliver on their marketing, with one brand it checked seemingly attracting the insects instead of keeping them away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Checks on Cherub Rubs Scatterbugs found that more mosquitos landed on the tester's forearm than before it was applied.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Of the 25 repellent brands examined, only one sample, containing Deet, passed the test perfectly, with no mosquitoes landing on the tester's arm.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some natural or herbal brands repelled certain types of mosquito, but not those that spread dengue fever.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, said consumers should choose the products carefully.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Mosquito repellent products with chemical or natural ingredients each have their own advantages and drawbacks. Consumers may consult physicians and pharmacists and choose suitable products according to usage and health conditions," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan also urged the makers of mosquito repellents to list out the ingredients in the label clearly and state whether the product is suitable for children.

    Spam call blocker apps pose privacy risk: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday warned that the personal data of people who use apps to block spam callers could be at risk because some of these apps pass on the information to third parties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The watchdog investigated five such apps and found that two of them uploaded details from the user’s list of contacts onto their databases.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The council found that third parties could then access sensitive details including addresses and the monthly rents the contacts paid.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It's suspected these were extracted from the contact lists of landlords or property agents who also used the apps.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The council found that one of the apps would also access up to eight items of personal data, including names, photos and dates of birth, when registered via Facebook.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, reminded users to stay vigilant when using these apps.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Consumers should pay attention to the following when using blocker apps. Read the terms of service and privacy policy before use, and evaluate whether the blocker app is trustworthy and the permission is reasonably commensurate with the functions offered," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite the privacy risk, Chan also called on users to proactively report spam to help apps identify and block the latest telemarketing and spam calls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.

    Encampment on California campus cleared

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Demonstrators clash with police as officers clear an encampment at the University of California, Irvine. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753383_1_20240516135013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday took back a lecture hall from pro-Palestinian protesters who for hours occupied the building at the University of California, Irvine, then cleared a student encampment that stood for more than two weeks, witnesses said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers from about 10 nearby law-enforcement agencies converged on the campus after university officials requested help because protesters had occupied the lecture hall, leading the school to declare it a "violent protest," police and university officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About four hours later, police had ejected the protesters from both the lecture hall and the plaza that had been the site of the encampment, according to the university and Reuters witnesses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The police have retaken the lecture hall," UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich said by telephone from the scene. "The plaza has been cleared by law-enforcement officers."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vasich said there were a "minimal number of arrests" and characterised the protesters as "begrudgingly cooperative."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The university said all classes would be held remotely on Thursday, asking employees not to come to campus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The demonstration at Irvine, about 65km south of Los Angeles, is the latest in a series of campus protests across the United States over the war in Gaza in which activists have called for a ceasefire and the protection of civilian lives while demanding universities divest from Israeli interests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UC Irvine protesters had established an encampment adjacent to the lecture hall on April 29 similar to those at other universities that have led to mass arrests and clashes with police elsewhere in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Wednesday, 200 to 300 protesters took over the lecture hall at a time when no classes were in session, Vasich said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police responded in riot gear and formed a barricade while an officer on a loudspeaker warned the crowd that they had formed an unlawful assembly and risked arrest if they remained, the Orange County Register reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Students chanted slogans, banged drums and hoisted banners, with rows of police standing nearby, Reuters witnessed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One banner hung from the building declared the site "Alex Odeh Hall," in honor of a Palestinian activist who was killed in a 1985 office bombing in the nearby city of Santa Ana.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Four adjacent research buildings with potentially hundreds of people inside were locked down, and those inside were instructed to shelter in place, Vasich said, though the university later altered that instruction and instead advised them to leave.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shortly before nightfall, police moved in on the lecture hall, then engaged in a tense standoff with protesters at the encampment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Helmeted police wielding batons formed a line against protesters. Police gradually moved forward, pushing the students back every few minutes, until the officers rushed the crowd and made more arrests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Before long most demonstrators had retreated, police held the otherwise empty plaza strewn with trash, and a few onlookers remained at the periphery. (Reuters)

    Pay Trend Survey results unveiled

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tentative results of a Pay Trend Survey that would help adjust civil service pay were released on Thursday, but organisers said it would be "premature" for people to presume the administration will adopt their figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The survey, based on data gathered from more than 110 private firms, points to rises of 4.01 percent for senior civil servants, 4.32 percent for middle-ranking workers and 5.47 percent for junior staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The numbers are not themselves recommendations in any way for an increase, decrease or anything. They are factors to be considered among a number of other factors," said Laurence Li, who chairs the Pay Trend Survey Committee.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's premature to try to forecast how these things will all be put into the pot."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government said other factors to consider when looking at pay rises for civil servants are the state of the economy, changes in the cost of living, the administration's fiscal position, pay claims from staff and civil service morale.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service Clement Leung was asked whether different weight will be put on the various factors when making a decision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Each year, in a way, is a separate exercise, because the economic situation, the situation of the government's fiscal position are different. Every time we will have to have two-way communications with our staff side's representatives," Leung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “That will be something that we will have to work on in the next few weeks, and particularly, listening to the views of our staff associations on their sentiments and their views on civil service morale, as well as their proposals."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, senior civil servants received pay rises of 2.87 percent, while those in middle and junior ranks got 4.65 percent. This was roughly in line with the results of that year's pay trend survey.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department on Thursday announced new ID card replacement arrangements as it prepares to move its headquarters from Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in the middle of next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From June 11, the new headquarters will start providing services, and the Registration of Persons office in Kwun Tong will also be relocated to Tseung Kwan O.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The main services provided by the Registration of Persons Office in Tseung Kwan O include applications for first registration of ID cards, replacement of ID cards due to due to defacement or loss, and amendment of registered particulars on ID cards," said assistant principal immigration officer Wong Ka-yee.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wong added that the Tseung Kwan O office will also handle the replacement of new smart ID cards during extended service hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 People who have applied for an ID card change on or before June 8 can collect their cards at a temporary office in Kwun Tong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, the Registration of Persons Office at Immigration Tower in Wan Chai will continue to provide ID card replacement services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 31 points in a triple-double, and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 104-92 to take a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference semifinal series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Doncic, the league's leading scorer in the regular season, had struggled some in the series against Oklahoma City.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Playing through a sprained right knee and a sore left ankle, he had averaged just 22 points on 39% shooting through the first four games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But in Game 5, he made 12 of 22 field goals and had 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his sixth career playoff triple-double.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Derrick Jones Jr. scored a playoff career-high 19 points and P.J. Washington Jr. added 10 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which shot 52.6% from the floor. The No. 5-seeded Mavericks can advance to the Western Conference finals with a win at home on Sunday morning Hong Kong time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 30 points for the top-seeded Thunder, but no other Oklahoma City player scored more than 13 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Mavericks won Game 5 on the road, just like they did in the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers. Dallas held Oklahoma City to 42.5% shooting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Oklahoma City tried to jump-start its struggling offense by replacing Josh Giddey with Isaiah Joe in the starting lineup. Giddey did not start for the first time in 229 combined regular season and postseason games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Dallas led by 15 in the second quarter and took a 54-44 edge into halftime. Jones scored 15 points before the break.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gilgeous-Alexander scored 14 points in the third quarter, but Dallas still led 79-67.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Thunder never got closer than seven points in the final period. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 2,500 policymakers, academics and medical professionals on Thursday gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for a two-day summit on health innovation and investment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The "Asia Summit on Global Health", jointly organised by the government and the Trade Development Council, features a series of thematic sessions on the latest trends in different medical sectors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the importance of public health.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Health is wealth. Health is an ever-revolving discipline that affects all of humanity. It affects the lives of every individual in any economy of the world, big or small, rich or poor, liberal or conservative. Public health is the foundation of society and the very basis of humankind to thrive," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also told the summit that the SAR thrives as an international metropolis that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the mainland and the rest of the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cao Xuetao, the vice-minister of the National Health Commission, told the same event that Hong Kong has been using its geopolitical advantages to promote healthcare development.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As an international centre for finance, shipping, trade, innovation and technology, Hong Kong has actively leveraged its advantage of having the strong support of the country and being closely connected to the world to innovate in medicine and health," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The mainland official added that it is crucial to work together and explore new opportunities in the field of medicine and health given complex changes in the international situation.
