<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tamar Park exhibition featuring hundreds of luminous ovoids will be extended by six days until June 8, officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apo Wu, who heads the Art Promotion Office, said some 900,000 people have already been to see the "teamLab: Continuous" exhibition since it opened as part of "Art@Harbour 2024" on March 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It surpassed our expectation. We do hope that more people can visit the exhibition and take advantage of the opportunity, which is why we extended the period by almost a week. We hope to see more visitors in the remaining time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu said the free exhibition has been a hit with mainland tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of similar exhibitions in the mainland, but they require an admission fee. So I think this exhibition has an attractiveness to people from the mainland. The weather during the Labour Day Golden Week was really bad with heavy rain, but we still saw some people go during light rainy periods," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an outdoor exhibition after all so the weather does affect the viewing experience. So we hope for the remaining viewing period, the weather will be nice, so that more people, despite the ending of the holiday period, can come back to Hong Kong to experience [the exhibition]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu added that a requirement for visitors to make bookings for part of the exhibition area will be scrapped from May 8.

    Jury to decide if liver patient died of misadventure

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jurors looking into the death of a liver disease patient, who died a few months after two transplants, were told on Monday to consider ruling that she died of misadventure or natural causes, or, less preferably, give an open verdict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. But her condition worsened and she died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After hearing from more than a dozen doctors who testified at court, coroner Monica Chow gave guidance to the jury on the 12th and final day of the inquest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner said if members of the jury, based on all the evidence heard in court, believed her liver failed because of a steroid or a kind of anti-cholesterol medication, then they should rule that she died of misadventure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, she said, if they think Tang actually suffered from auto-immune hepatitis and that was what triggered her liver failure, then they should rule that she died of natural causes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner said in case they cannot determine what caused her liver failure, the jury can give an open verdict, but there should be enough evidence to decide what happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jury retired to consider its verdict on Tuesday.

    Punish officials over govt data leaks: lawmaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Elizabeth Quat says personal data leaks by government departments and public bodies are completely unacceptable. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752000_1_20240506155958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The heads of government departments responsible for data leaks should be held accountable and punished for the blunders, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the Companies Registry said data on some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform, just a day after the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department said a password problem put data on 17,000 public housing tenants at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quat, who chairs Legco's Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting, said personal data leaks by government departments and public bodies are completely unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the heads of departments should bear responsibility for safeguarding sensitive data, rather than relying on the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), which serves as the government's main IT support office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The head of the department should be responsible for all the cyber security issues of their own department, computer system and networking. We suggest the government to make sure that all the government heads, department heads and also the IT project heads are responsible for all the cyber security issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, said he was surprised by the apparent failure of the Companies Registry to conduct a security check on a new system prior to its launch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is actually a design fault on a new system implemented. So I was surprised why they had not done any security check before the system was implemented and launched," Fong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Similar mistakes have happened again and again in different IT departments. So if all these IT departments can get guidelines from the OGCIO, I hope we can solve this problem once and for all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong also called on government departments to enhance collaboration in safeguarding data security.

    Israel tells Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said Monday it was evacuating about 100,000 people from eastern Rafah, ahead of an expected ground assault in the southern city of Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The estimate is around 100,000 people," a military spokesman told journalists when asked how many people were being evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1.2 million people are currently sheltering in Rafah, according to the World Health Organisation, most having fled there from elsewhere in Gaza during the seven-month war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation "is part of our plans to dismantle Hamas... we had a violent reminder of their presence and their operational abilities in Rafah yesterday," the military spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an evacuation plan to get people out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three Israeli soldiers were killed and a dozen wounded, the army said, when a barrage of rockets was fired towards the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army said the rockets were fired from an area adjacent to Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldiers were hit while guarding heavy machinery, tanks and bulldozers stationed in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain fell on Monday as the army airdropped leaflets advising about the evacuation, an AFP correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's armed wing claimed the rocket attack, which led Israeli authorities to close the crossing, used to deliver aid into Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong (HKU) nursing student has been cleared of groping a first-year pupil during an orientation camp last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday acquitted Tang Ho-yin, 20, of indecent assault and common assault, two charges he previously pleaded not guilty to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court had heard that Tang indecently assaulted a woman in an activity room at Po Leung Kuk Jockey Club Tai Tong Holiday Camp on August 20, 2023, and groped her again in a dormitory living room the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, magistrate Frances Leung said the witness of the first alleged incident, during a game at the orientation camp, failed to identify the facial features of the perpetrator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court was not reassured that the defendant was the perpetrator, Leung added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the common assault charge against Tang, the judge said the court accepted that the defendant's hand had moved up and down the alleged victim's arm while discussing sexual content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Leung also noted the alleged victim had voluntarily extended her arm out to demonstrate an element of the discussion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China saw a 35 percent jump in the number of arrivals and departures during the May Day holiday from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, border inspection agencies across the country handled nearly 8.47 million entry and exit trips during the five-day holiday that ended on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's a 35.1 percent increase year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the number of arrivals and departures peaked on May 3, with more than 1.8 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland travellers accounted for more than half of all the trips, at 4.77 million; people from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan made 2.92 million trips; and travellers from abroad accounted for the rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed about 295 million domestic tourist trips were made during the May Day holiday, up 7.6 percent year on year and 28.2 percent from the same period in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said both inbound and outbound tourism have been recovering rapidly, due to the resumption of more air routes and introduction of measures to facilitate visitors' entry, among other factors (Reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Eddie Yue, on Monday urged banks to be prepared to operate during severe weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yue told reporters that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is making progress towards ensuring local stock and derivatives markets can still function during adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong Exchanges is now finalising the arrangement and we have asked the banks to make sure that they get prepared, so that whatever the final arrangement is they will be able to support it and we have asked them to make early preparations for example on if there should be any system change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's remarks follow the completion of a public consultation exercise by HKEX in January on ending stock market closures during severe weather events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Yue said the HKMA will host the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit from November 18 to 20, adding that around 50 to 60 people have confirmed their attendance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA chief said he hopes the summit will attract prominent business figures to Hong Kong and will strengthen the city’s position as an international financial hub.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said its Exchange Fund posted an investment gain of HK$54.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, despite the underwhelming performance of local stock markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the second consecutive quarter of gains for the fund, whose primary role is to back the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a panel meeting in the Legislative Council, the HKMA revealed that the fund lost HK$2.3 billion in local equities in the first quarter and lost HK$4.8 billion on its foreign exchange assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, these were offset by gains of HK$25.1 billion from bond investments and HK$36.3 billion from other stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the future performance of the fund remains uncertain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The uncertainty about the US interest rate path, which will depend on the path of inflation in the US... we will still need to see the incoming economic data and see where the inflation path in the US will go, and see whether they will, as the market is expecting now, defer the rate cut decision and also the pace may be a little slower than expected before,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue also said tensions in the Middle East and the pace of economic recovery in mainland China contribute additional uncertainty to the performance of the Exchange Fund.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A spokesman for the Hong Kong Meteorological Society, Leung Wing-mo, said on Monday that it would not be possible to tailor rainstorm warnings for particular districts, because rain is extremely unpredictable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, the Red Rainstorm Warning was in place for nearly seven hours and flooding and landslides were reported in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory had at one point raised the possibility of a Black Rainstorm Warning and some people questioned why the alert wasn't issued, even though rain was particularly heavy where they were.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, a former assistant director at the observatory, said rainstorm warnings are generally issued when rainfall at a certain amount of monitoring stations around the city meet the relevant criteria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that on Saturday, government forecasters provided supplementary information regarding the amount of rain recorded in different places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Really, the downpours are part of nature, they may happen wherever. So forecasting where exactly the rain will be is very difficult," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can only issue warnings based on rainfall for the whole of Hong Kong, that the amount recorded or the expected amount, triggers the corresponding rainstorm warning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung described the heavy rain on Saturday as rare, although he noted that April is regarded as belonging to the "flooding season" in South China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the climate has changed because of global warming and people can expect more extreme weather conditions and heavier rain from now on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Sai Kung district councillor Christine Fong said hundreds of vehicles were trapped by floods on Saturday after the heavy rain caught drivers by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested officials build stormwater storage facilities or an artificial lake in Hebe Haven and Ho Chung.

    'Time for sectors to work on boosting tourist numbers'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="760,000 mainland tourist arrivals were recorded during Golden Week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Monday said various sectors should reflect on how to attract more tourists, as consumption patterns have changed since the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Journal, Dane Cheng said he was satisfied that Hong Kong saw about 11 million visitor arrivals in the first quarter of the year, and he expects the number to rise in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said Hong Kong has been doing a lot in terms of promotion and holding mega events, and it's time for different sectors to reflect on how to attract more tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The problem now is, tourist numbers recovered back to 70 percent [of pre-Covid numbers], but the departure number for local people is over 100 percent... No matter whether it's the catering sector or the retail sector, if your business can't retain the locals, how can you expect it to attract tourists?" he questioned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that people should stop comparing current tourist numbers with those before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's unrealistic for tourist numbers to return to the levels of 2018 and 2019... Back then, when so many people were coming to Hong Kong, no matter which area was that, Hong Kong people were overloaded. Tourists also want a good experience, instead of staying in a crowded place," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, chairwoman of the Travel Industry Council Gianna Hsu said there were about 760,000 mainland tourist arrivals during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after attending a radio programme, Hsu said the rainy weather did not affect the mood of tourists, and some businesses even benefited from the poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was rain occasionally, urging some tourists to visit shopping malls. Therefore, I believe the retail sales for shopping malls had seen improvements. We expect Golden Week will bring about HK$2 billion consumption revenue to Hong Kong. We look forward to the next Golden Week holiday," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers silenced the young guns of Orlando, beating the Magic 106-94 in game seven of their NBA playoffs first-round series Sunday to book a meeting with Eastern Conference top seeds Boston.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was another magisterial performance from Mitchell, who scored 39 points two days after pouring in 50 in the Cavs' game six defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time he had plenty of scoring support from teammates as the Cavs erased an 18-point second-quarter deficit to clinch a series in which the home team won every game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caris LeVert scored 15 points off the bench and Max Strus scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter, when the Cavs out-scored the Magic 33-15 to take charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evan Mobley scored 11 points with 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to help Cleveland withstand a 38-point performance from Paolo Banchero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, with starting center Jarrett Allen sidelined a third straight game with bruised ribs, moved on to the second round a year after a stinging first-round loss to the New York Knicks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Magic pushed their lead to as many as 18 points in the second quarter before the Cavs clawed back to cut the lead to single digits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banchero's layup in the closing seconds of the first half saw Orlando take a 10-point lead into the break, but momentum was on Cleveland's side and they overwhelmed the Magic in the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitchell, relentless in the paint, tied it at 64-64 with a floater and LeVert drained a pair of free throws to give the Cavs their first lead since the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs pushed their advantage to 14 points in the final frame, fans chanting "We want the Celtics" as the final minutes ticked off. (AFP)

    Norris wins Miami Grand Prix for maiden F1 win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "About time huh?" said Norris, "I knew on Friday that we had the pace...today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off," he added. (AFP)

    'Shortened nursing programme won't affect teaching'

'Shortened nursing programme won't affect teaching'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751860_1_20240505112332.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has announced plans to shorten the duration of its nursing programme starting from the new academic year in September, allowing students to complete the entire course in 3.5 years instead of the current four years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HA launched the Professional Diploma in Nursing three years ago, offering classes in its three nursing schools at Caritas Medical Centre, Tuen Mun and Queen Elizabeth hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon graduation, students can choose to become registered general nurses and pursue a bachelor’s degree in other institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Au, principal at Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s nursing school, explained the decision to shorten the duration of the programme was made “in view of the arrangement of placement and learning for the students”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually there is no change in the contents we teach to the students, like the theories and the skills, there is no change, just the period has been shortened,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said students will still be entitled to at least 1,400 hours of internship in public hospitals and their learning outcome won't be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From their very first placement, students will assist registered nurses to carry out various tasks, including measuring blood pressure, feeding dependent patients and distributing medications, Au said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about the high attrition rate among nurses in recent years, with over 1,800 full-time nurses at public hospitals having left their positions last year, Au stressed the three nursing schools had already reached their maximum capacity with 300 places offered each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said a lot would need to be considered if authorities wanted to increase quotas at the schools, including finding extra teaching space and staff, as well as liaising with the Nursing Council of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tuition fee for the 3.5-year programme is HK$132,700. Applications close on July 19.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eurovision 2024 began in the Swedish city of Malmo on Sunday when 37 contenders walked the "Turquoise Carpet" amid heightened security and calls for boycotts due to Israel's participation.
 <br>
  <br>
   The 68th version of the song contest, which is always billed as non-political, is taking place against the backdrop of the devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much focus is expected to be on Israeli contestant Eden Golan, when she performs her song "Hurricane" in the second semi-final on Thursday, with bookmakers placing the entry among the top 10 to win the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli delegation did not attend the carpet on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, said Swedish broadcaster SVT, which co-organises the contest with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song "October Rain", which the EBU said made reference to the October 7 Hamas onslaught.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The contest comprises three live shows, with half a dozen countries having a shot at the title this year, according to fans and bookmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sweden's Loreen won the 2023 competition in Liverpool, northern England, with her song "Tattoo", granting the Nordic country an automatic entry into next Saturday's grand final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The "Big Five" of the EBU - the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - are also automatically given a spot in the final, while the other contenders will compete in semi-finals for the remaining places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will be the seventh time Sweden is hosting the song contest after last doing so in 2016, and the third time Malmo will stage the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sweden's participants for this year, twins Marcus & Martinus, were drawn in March to open the final with their dance pop song "Unforgettable". (Reuters)

    Gaza ceasefire hopes fade amid impasse

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians look at the rubble left after an Israeli strike on a house in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751914_1_20240506005518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prospects for a Gaza ceasefire appeared slim on Sunday as Hamas reiterated its demand for an end to the war in exchange for the freeing of hostages, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flatly ruled that out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two sides blamed each other for the impasse and the Hamas delegation said it would leave Cairo truce talks on Sunday night to consult with its leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In their second day of talks with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, Hamas negotiators maintained their stance that any truce agreement must end the war, Palestinian officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have not travelled to Cairo to take part in indirect diplomacy, but on Sunday Netanyahu reiterated Israel's aim since the start of the war nearly seven months ago: to disarm and dismantle the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for good or else endanger Israel's future security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said Israel was willing to pause fighting in Gaza in order to secure the release of hostages still being held by Hamas, believed to number more than 130.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But while Israel has shown willingness, Hamas remains entrenched in its extreme positions, first among them the demand to remove all our forces from the Gaza Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas in power," Netanyahu said. "Israel cannot accept that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indicating that this round of talks may soon unwind, a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters on Sunday: "If Netanyahu doesn't change his mind, there will be no reason to stay. They can always reconvene if that changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The latest round of mediation in Cairo is near to collapse," one official briefed on the talks told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas did not seem to be serious about reaching a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are observing worrying signs that Hamas does not intend to reach an agreement with us," Gallant said. "This means strong military action in Rafah will begin in the very near future, and in the rest of the Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released shortly after Netanyahu's, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was still keen on reaching a comprehensive ceasefire that ends the Israeli "aggression", guarantees Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and achieves "a serious" deal to free Israelis being held hostage in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh blamed Netanyahu for "the continuation of the aggression and the expansion of the circle of conflict, and sabotaging the efforts made through the mediators and various parties".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began after Hamas stunned Israel with a cross-border raid on October 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.

  More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed, 29 of them in the past 24 hours, and more than 77,000 have been wounded in Israel's assault, according to Gaza's health ministry. The bombardment has devastated much of the coastal enclave and caused a humanitarian crisis. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand secured double glory at the Singapore Sevens on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's tournaments to signal their Olympic intent with the Paris Games fast approaching.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's men held off a determined challenge from Ireland to win 17-14 while their women's team surged to a 31-21 victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand raced into an early 10-0 lead in the men's final with tries by Leroy Carter and Fehi Fineanganofo but Gavin Mullin narrowed the deficit for the Irish just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dylan Collier restored New Zealand's 10-point cushion in the second half but Harry McNulty's response set up a tense finale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held on for their second series win in a row after their success at Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand forward Tone Ng Shiu said his team were building momentum for the sevens series grand final in Madrid and the Paris Olympics in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We started off slow in the world series this year but now we're just building up to the Olympics, taking it one tournament at a time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two wins in a row -- you've got to be happy with that," added Ng Shiu, who was in the New Zealand side that took the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know there's a bit of pressure to get that gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried two times and we weren't quite there. So hopefully we can embrace the pressure at the next tournament and build for the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina were crowned men's series winners after they recovered from a 10-point deficit to beat South Africa 14-10 in the fifth-place playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Americans won tournaments earlier this season in Cape Town, Perth and Vancouver to top the table with 106 points, two points ahead of the second-placed Irish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain bounced back from a heart-breaking 15-12 extra-time loss to Ireland in the semi-finals to trounce Australia 29-7 in the third-place match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result saw GB leapfrog the United States for eighth place in the league standings and secured their status as a core team in next season's world series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be in that top eight in Madrid secures our programme's funding for another year," said GB captain Robbie Fergusson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means the boys have jobs next year, it means we can have contracts. It means everything," said the Scot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody gave us a hope-in-hell chance this weekend of pushing the USA out of the top eight and taking that spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we had total belief in our group and we did something special this weekend and hopefully we can kickstart a special few months now heading into the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina, Ireland and Great Britain will be joined in the grand final by New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, France and South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, Spain, Samoa and Canada finished outside the top eight and will face four teams from the challenger series in a promotion-relegation event in Madrid to determine next season's core teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, New Zealand clinched top spot in the standings after a hat-trick of tries by Michaela Blyde helped them to a convincing victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a clash between the top two teams, the Black Ferns trailed 14-5 late in the first half but scored four tries to win their fourth straight tournament after victories in Vancouver, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France finished third in Singapore and in the standings after a 29-7 victory over Fiji. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans hold a Chinese flag after the men’s finals of the Thomas and Uber Cup badminton tournament in Chengdu. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751910_1_20240506002250.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed a Thomas and Uber Cup double on Sunday as both men's and women's teams beat Indonesia to win their respective world team championship finals in Chengdu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men, who won 3-1, lifted China's first Thomas Cup since they beat Japan in 2018 – and their 11th in all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it meant agony again for 14-time winners Indonesia, who lost their second successive final after falling to India two years ago in Bangkok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's event, Indonesia had earlier been powerless to prevent a flawless China lifting the Uber Cup for a record-extending 16th time with a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next most successful women's nation are Japan, who have won the Uber Cup six times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Bingjiao's 10-21, 21-15, 21-17 victory against Ester Nurumi Tri Wardoyo completed a perfect 24-0 tournament match record for China's women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They regained the title they lost to South Korea two years ago in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the night session, world number two Shi Yuqi got China's men off to a fast start by destroying seventh-ranked Anthony Ginting 21-17, 21-6 in 43 hugely impressive minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pivotal moments came in the first doubles as Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang edged an epic to beat Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto 21-18, 17-21, 21-17 in a 64-minute thriller.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair fought back time and again after trailing 10-4 in the opening game, 6-3 in the second and 8-4 in the third in a gutsy display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number three Jonatan Christie gave Indonesia some hope when he beat sixth-ranked Li Shifeng 21-16, 15-21, 21-17 in 1hr 17min of see-saw action to extend the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Indonesia's chances were snuffed out when He Jiting and Ren Xiangyu ran away with the second doubles 21-11, 21-15 in just 37 minutes to beat Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana and seal the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the outranked Indonesian women's slim chances had hinged on Gregoria Mariska Tunjung breaking through in the opening singles against Chen Yufei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chen never allowed her opponent into the contest in a comprehensive 21-7, 21-16 win in just 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I didn't feel that comfortable although I have played such matches before," said Chen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still feel stressed, and maybe my opponent was. I always feel pressured in finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have lost to her before. What I did was watch a lot of matches that I'd lost to her. It's not going to help if I only watch matches that I won."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan did not give Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti and Ribka Sugiarto a sniff in a 39-minute doubles demolition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scariest thing is when people think you should win," said Chen Qingchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Things become different when you assume you can win. The only thing we need to do is prepare and be humble."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their 21-11, 21-8 canter set up He for the Cup-winning victory in the second singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the last three years we experienced failures, and I'm happy that we could regain the title," said He. (AFP)

    Liverpool crush Spurs, adding to Villa's misery

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool shattered Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the Premier League's top four with a 4-2 win that left Aston Villa on the brink of Champions League qualification despite their 1-0 defeat at Brighton on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a win at Anfield to close the gap on fourth-placed Villa, Tottenham slumped to a fourth successive loss to leave their Champions League hopes in tatters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are seven points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have a game in hand but will miss out on the top four if Unai Emery's men win one of their remaining two matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Salah was back in the Liverpool team after being dropped for last weekend's draw at West Ham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp, in the final weeks of his nine-year reign, was celebrating in the 16th minute when Salah notched his 25th goal in all competitions this term with a clinical header from Cody Gakpo's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Robertson scored Liverpool's second on the stroke of half-time as the Scotland left-back finished from close-range after Salah's shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was worse to come for woeful Tottenham as Gakpo headed in a 50th-minute cross from Harvey Elliott, who netted the fourth in the 59th minute with a superb curler from 20 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was little consolation for Tottenham that Richarlison reduced the deficit in the 72nd minute before setting up Son Heung-min's goal five minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Villa win combined with a Tottenham loss would have sealed a Champions League place for Emery's side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Villa were unable to fulfil their part of that equation as Joao Pedro's 87th-minute goal condemned them to a second painful defeat in four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ending Brighton's six-match winless run, Pedro headed in the rebound after Robin Olsen saved his penalty, which had been awarded for Ezri Konsa's foul on Simon Adingra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Stamford Bridge, seventh-placed Chelsea thrashed West Ham 5-0 to keep alive their hopes of European qualification. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sino-French relations over the past 60 years have been at the forefront of China's ties with major Western countries, setting a good example for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems, President Xi Jinping said on Sunday as he arrived in France for a state visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, met Xi at the airport at the start of his first visit to a European Union country in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written speech, Xinhua reported that Xi also described Sino-French relations as a model of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted the president as saying the development of China-France ties brings benefits to the two peoples and injected stability, positive energy into a turbulent world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also said China was ready to consolidate traditional friendship, enhance political mutual trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields with France through the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi is expected to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen on his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his European visit, Xi will also visit Hungary and Serbia.

    Clear Water Bay Road reopens after repair work

Clear Water Bay Road reopens after repair work
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751887_1_20240505174611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department said early on Monday that Clear Water Bay Road was back to normal, after being disrupted by a landslide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A slope measuring 30 metres long and 40 metres deep collapsed, and part of the pavement also caved in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slip forced officials to implement an arrangement in which two-way traffic shared the same lane near Wing Lung Road in Hang Hau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said earlier that Clear Water Bay Road should be open again by rush hour on Monday morning, after workers carried out remedial work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said workers were spraying concrete onto the slope, and more work would be carried out later to further consolidate the structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we open the road, we have to ensure it's safe after the temporary consolidation work. If we can't do that, we won't open the road," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we'll have measures in place. Our contractor and the Highways Department will keep monitoring the situation here. We'll also liaise with the observatory to see if the weather will worsen, and we've installed some sump pumps in case there's heavy rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities received 14 other landslide reports on Saturday, when the amber and red rainstorm warning signals were in effect for most of the day.

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751888_1_20240505174332.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging floods and mudslides this past week have killed at least 55 people in southern Brazil and forced nearly 70,000 to flee their homes, the country's civil defence agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said least 74 people were injured and another 67 were missing from the catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-rising water levels in the state of Rio Grande do Sul were straining dams and threatening the economically important city of Porto Alegre, home to some 1.4 million residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guaiba River, which flows through the city, was at a historic high of 5.04 metres, well above the 4.76 metres that had stood as a record since the devastating floods of 1941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities scrambled to evacuate swamped neighbourhoods as rescue workers used four-wheel-drive vehicles -- and even jet skis -- to move through waist-deep water in search of the stranded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence officials also said more than a million people lacked access to potable water amid the flooding, describing damage as incalculable. (AFP)

 Adrian Otaegui shot a superb seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to come from five shots back to win the Volvo China Open and a place in the US PGA Championship in two weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard finished on a 54-hole total of 198, 18-under par, to win the weather-shortened event at Hidden Grace Golf Club in Shenzhen after Saturday's play was cancelled because of dangerous storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave him victory by one stroke from Italy's Guido Migliozzi, who carded a final-round 67.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-round leader Sebastian Soderberg of Sweden, who started five clear of Otaegui, saw the title slip from his grasp with a sorry double-bogey at the 18th when a par would have taken him into a playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished at 16-under par after a 72 alongside England's Paul Waring (69) and Switzerland's Joel Girrbach (67).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was starting five shots back so I just didn't look at the leaderboard, not think about the result. Just play my game," said Otaegui who won his fifth DP World (European) Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Otaegui's victory in the final event of the DP World Tour's Asian Swing secured a berth at the season's second major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla, beginning on May 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, that's very good news," said Otaegui when informed that he had finished third on the Asian Swing standings -- enough to get him into the next major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing some majors this year was a big goal for me," said the world number 143.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will just be enough time to rest a little bit at home next week and then head to America."

    People attempt bun tower climbing in Cheung Chau

People attempt bun tower climbing in Cheung Chau

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A climbing carnival took place at Cheung Chau on Sunday, ahead of the island's traditional bun-scrambling competition on Buddha's Birthday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-metre-high bun tower frame is already in place for the competition on May 15, and carnival-goers were given the chance to see whether they could climb it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung said her son had managed the feat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried bun scrambling over the years. When my son was young, he couldn't reach the top. Last time we came, he was able to get there at a slow pace with the help of his dad. But this time, he was able to do it all by himself very quickly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so happy to see him achieve that because yesterday it was raining really hard so I thought there wouldn't be a chance. Luckily the weather is beautiful. It's a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung's 13-year-old son has now climbed the tower at least four times. He gave his advice on the best way to approach the climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There isn't a specific technique to climbing. You just have to grasp the bamboo tightly and watch your footing. I love experiencing Hong Kong culture. I want to preserve and pass on Hong Kong culture like bun scrambling so more people know about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I personally love eating lucky buns and watching bun scrambling on television, so I really wanted to see if it is actually that exhilarating in person, and see if it's really that easy or difficult."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another visitor, Ms Lok, said she brought her friends from overseas to the carnival, so they could experience a bit of Hong Kong culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were shaking while climbing because the gaps are so small, but we had a lot of fun. Huge respect to those who can climb up so quickly. I think this is a great tradition to preserve, and I love the meaning behind it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can pass peace to anyone, even if you aren't Chinese. My friends wanted to experience something quite traditional and this definitely checks the box."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, workers have been working hard to reconstruct the three traditional giant bun towers for display ahead of next week's festivities, after Saturday's heavy winds caused the bamboo scaffolding to collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung Chi-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong Cheung Chau Bun Festival Committee, said it would take one to two days to complete, but progress was going well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never experienced the collapse of the bun tower scaffolding before. It was because the heavy winds hit it down. It is quite a rare incident. The latest situation is quite ideal. We thought it would take three to four days, but they've sent more people to help so the speed has increased significantly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at eight in the morning and everything has already been dismantled, and ready for reconstruction. I think everything can be restored in one to two days. I believe it will be reinforced this time around."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung also said the incident had incurred a cost, but he had not yet calculated how much money was involved. He added it was most important the Bun Festival runs smoothly next week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saul "Canelo" Alvarez retained his undisputed super-middleweight world title with a convincing unanimous decision over fellow Mexican Jaime Munguia on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez handed Munguia the first defeat in 44 professional bouts, dropping the 27-year-old challenger in the fourth round and inexorably taking control to improve to 61-2-2 in his storied career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges scored it 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112 for Alvarez, who retained his IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO belts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, whose 34 knockouts included victories inside the distance in four of his previous five fights, came out on the attack against the vastly experienced Alvarez, pushing him back with his jab and rattling the champion in the third round with a right to the jaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Alvarez responded in the fourth. After Munguia connected with a pair of solid rights Alvarez followed a left hook with a massive uppercut that sent Munguia to the canvas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth round opened to chants of "Canelo!" ringing in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, where support was evenly divided between the Mexican combatants in a fight coinciding with Mexico's Cinco de Mayo festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Alvarez jab popped Munguia's head back and, in the sixth, an Alvarez left hook had Munguia's knees buckling briefly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a fight billed as a possible changing of the guard, Munguia -- who has honed his aggressive style under the tutelage of longtime Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach -- continued to press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his vaunted power rarely bothered Alvarez, who repeatedly found away past Munguia's guard to land the more damaging blows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know, I take my time," Alvarez said of his measured start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a lot of experience. Jaime Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong. He's smart, but I take my time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have 12 rounds to win the fight, and I did. I did really good and I feel proud about it," added Alvarez, who hasn't posted a knockout since he stopped Caleb Plant in the 11th round in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez said that after a few rounds he could see everything that was coming from Munguia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's strong, but he's a little slow," Alvarez said. "I can see every punch." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian police said on Sunday they had shot dead a boy after he stabbed a man in Western Australia's capital Perth, in an attack authorities said indicated terrorism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were signs the 16-year-old, armed with a kitchen knife, had been radicalised online, state authorities said, adding they received calls from concerned members of the local Muslim community before the attack, which occurred late on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack, in the suburb of Willetton, had "hallmarks" of terrorism but was yet to be declared a terrorist act, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone," Western Australia Premier Roger Cook told a televised press conference in the state capital Perth, regarding the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victim, stabbed in the back, was stable in hospital, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the incident by police and intelligence agencies, which advised there was no ongoing threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia," Albanese said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's top IT office on Sunday said it was asking all bureaus and departments to comprehensively review their data security measures, and reply within a week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after reports of two data leaks in the past few days, involving the Companies Registry and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registry said on Friday the data of some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before, the EMSD apologised over the data leak of some 17,000 public housing residents who had to undergo mandatory Covid tests in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the issue on social media, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said it's highly concerned about the incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had again sent clear directives to the heads of bureaus and departments about the reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also reminded all users and systems under the departments that they must stringently comply with the government's rules, policies and guidelines on data security in handling sensitive and personal information," it said in the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office added this includes never storing data on publicly-owned cloud platforms.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says while adjustments will be made to the scheme, officials will try to minimise the effects on beneficiaries. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751866_1_20240505125439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said officials don't plan to change the eligible age and coverage of the HK$2 transport subsidy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government plans to complete a review of the scheme by the end of 2024, as its bill is expected to increase by 50 percent, to more than HK$6 billion this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said while there's a need to make changes to the scheme to ensure it is more financially viable in the long run, officials would keep several aspects of this "good policy" unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overriding principle is that the original intention of the scheme doesn't change - those benefiting from the scheme, that is elderly people aged 60 and above and the disabled, this won't change," the minister said on a TVB programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government did not plan to ban the more expensive bus and minibus trips to the border, saying beneficiaries have gotten used to the travel convenience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials would try their best not to make it troublesome for the beneficiaries, or affect their willingness to travel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that officials would do more to tackle abuses by those who are not eligible for the scheme, and do more promotion to encourage beneficiaries to take cheaper rides whenever possible.

    Golden Week tourists to boost city by HK$2 billion

Golden Week tourists to boost city by HK$2 billion

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the total number of mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong should reach the estimated 800,000 mark with the Golden Week holiday wrapping up on Sunday, adding it would boost the economy by over HK$2 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said approximately 670,000 mainland tourists had already come to the territory in the first four days despite the rainy weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The entire Guangdong Province was affected by the unstable weather, and tourists can see that the weather is also not that good in Hong Kong, so they may postpone their trip. However, the overall numbers aren't bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that we will reach our estimated number of tourists. If we have around 800,000 mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong, I think we can earn over two billion dollars in consumption. Even though we have only reached about 700,000 people so far, we should still reach over two billion dollars."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the mixed reviews of the Labour Day pyrotechnic display, Yeung said it was no surprise that people had expectations for the fireworks show, but the weather was unpredictable in how it would affect the viewing experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rain is hard to predict, unlike wind which comes when it comes. Even if you see rain clouds, you don't know if it will actually rain. So up until 4pm of that day, we then decided it was appropriate to host the show," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was watching from the top of a bridge where the wind was hitting so from the start of the fireworks, the smoke did reach me. However, from other viewing angles, people have sent me clear and beautiful photos of the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added they would learn from this experience and do better in terms of publicity and expectation management in the future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong's economy was maintaining its momentum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan said the city’s GDP had increased five quarters in a row, with growth going up 2.7 percent year-on-year in the quarter ending in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market sentiment had also improved, he said, with the Hang Seng Index gaining almost 14 percent recently after going up for nine consecutive days, while the property market had become more active after measures to curb speculation were lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said inbound tourism was one of the key drivers of the economy in the first quarter, adding the number of arrivals during the first three days of Golden Week, which stood at nearly 650,000, was up 25 percent from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said external uncertainties remained, and that higher interest rates and a strong Hong Kong dollar would affect the city's tourism sector, as well as export and investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on companies to develop new products to explore new ways to manage their businesses, noting that authorities were helping SMEs to go digital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief, who was attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said many participants were interested in the development of the digital economy as well as the innovation and technology sector in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added authorities recently published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, to provide a clearer definition of green products and help the sector reduce "greenwashing" risks.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was a three-way thriller to the wire in the 150th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mystik Dan, ridden by Brian Hernandez, held on late to win a three-way photo finish by just a nose over Sierra Leone and Forever Young to capture the first leg of the Triple Crown on Saturday night in front of 156,710 fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's like a dream come true," Hernandez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sent off at odds of 18-1, Mystik Dan made the turn for home in front and stayed on the rail with Forever Young just to his outside and Sierra Leone on the far outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a gasp from the crowd as the three colts hit the finish line. It took several minutes for the racing stewards to look at the finish line photo and declare Mystik Dan the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- which is the closest margin you can have in horse racing -- and it was the first nose decision since Grindstone edged out Cavonnier in the 1996 Derby. (Reuters)

    Tax hike by US government 'likely': Buffett

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett said he expects the US government to increase taxes to tackle widening fiscal deficits rather than reduce spending.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think higher taxes are likely," he said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They may decide that some day they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large because that has some important consequences. So they may not want to decrease spending and they may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we own, and we’ll pay it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in its latest long-term budget projections federal deficits will rise to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2054 from 5.5 percent in fiscal 2024. US budget deficits are expected to deteriorate if tax cuts introduced in 2017 are renewed next year. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland remained in the hunt to win the world rugby sevens series title after they came from behind to beat series leaders Argentina 21-5 in the quarterfinals in Singapore on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Americans could have been crowned regular season champions with a win at the National Stadium and they took the lead when Tobias Wade opened the scoring late in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Ireland hit back through Jordan Conroy just before half-time and tries after the interval by Terry Kennedy and Billy Davis secured their victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland have not finished higher than third in this season's series and would need to win the Singapore event while hoping Argentina lose to South Africa in the fifth-place play-off in order to clinch the series title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Conroy was delighted with his side's performance in the must-win game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was a very important game. It was the decider for who could possibly win the whole series, so we were really focused and worked hard and we got the result," said the 30-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we had lost, we would have been out of the title race. But now we've put ourselves in a really good position for tomorrow and we will get our teeth sunk in then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland's semi-final opponents on Sunday will be Great Britain who trounced France 35-7 in their quarterfinal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British were beaten 19-5 by Ireland in their opening pool game in Singapore but battled back to beat Fiji and the United States to secure their place in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other semi-final will feature Australia and New Zealand who came through a pair of hard-fought quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia squandered a 19-point lead against South Africa but came back to win 29-24 in extra time while New Zealand prevailed 19-14 against the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regular season winners of the sevens series will be decided in Singapore with the top eight teams going through to the grand final in Madrid later this month while the bottom four sides will compete in a promotion-relegation event to determine the core teams for next season's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, series co-leaders New Zealand and Australia remained on course for a showdown in Sunday's final after they maintained their perfect records in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand topped their pool with emphatic wins against Ireland, Canada and Spain before seeing off Great Britain 24-5 in the quarter-finals while Australia beat Fiji, Great Britain and Brazil in pool play and sealed their place in the last four with a 24-14 win over Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiji will face New Zealand in the semi-finals after edging Japan 12-10 while France will take on the Australians following a 24-0 trouncing of Canada. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour leader Keir Starmer has hailed a swing to Labour, just five years after the party was trounced by the Conservatives. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751833_1_20240505020621.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's ruling Conservatives on Saturday braced for further losses in local elections, their worst results in recent memory and a key test before a general election to be held by January.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party lost nearly 500 councillors and control of 12 councils as well as a parliamentary seat, after voting on Thursday across a swathe of England saw the Labour opposition make huge gains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The beleaguered Tory leader faces more likely defeats when results of crunch mayoral races -- in London, Liverpool and Manchester -- are announced later, but is hoping to retain the West Midlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare success on Friday, a Tory mayor won a third term in Tees Valley, northeast England -- albeit with a vastly reduced majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, out of power since 2010 and trounced by Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election in 2019, seized on its claim to the Blackpool South seat in parliament and other successes to demand a national vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's turn the page on decline," Labour leader Keir Starmer told supporters on Saturday in the East Midlands, where the party won the mayoral race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak must order a general election be held by January 28 next year at the latest, and has said he is planning on a poll in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Sunak conceded the returns showed "voters are frustrated" but insisted "Labour is not winning in places they admit they need for a majority".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We Conservatives have everything to fight for," Sunak concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for all of Sunak's 18 months in charge, as previous scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and various other issues dent the Tories' standing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, they were defending nearly 1,000 council seats, many secured in 2021 when they led nationwide polls before the implosion of Johnson's premiership and his successor Liz Truss's disastrous 49-day tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With almost all those results in by Saturday morning, they had lost close to half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If replicated in a nationwide contest, the initial tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points, according to the BBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky News' projection for a general election using the results predicted Labour will be the largest party but short of an overall majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its by-election scalp in Blackpool -- on a mammoth 26-percent swing -- was the Conservatives' 11th such loss in this parliament, the most by any government since the late 1960s. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland scored four times as Manchester City thrashed Wolves 5-1 to move within one point of Arsenal after the Premier League leaders beat Bournemouth 3-0 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  City responded to Arsenal's victory just hours earlier with a goal blitz at the Etihad Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's side took the lead in the 12th minute when Rayan Ait-Nouri clattered into Josko Gvardiol, conceding a penalty that Haaland stroked past Jose Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland bagged City's second in the 35th minute as he rose highest at the far post to meet Rodri's cross with a majestic header that looped over Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deep into first half stoppage-time, Nelson Semedo tripped Haaland to give City another penalty that was drilled home by the Norway striker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hwang Hee-chan got one back for Wolves in the 53rd minute after a mistake by City keeper Ederson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Haaland curled a fine finish into the far corner in the 54th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez's 85th minute finish capped City's sixth consecutive league win, extending their unbeaten run in the competition to 20 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reigning champions, who have a game in hand on Arsenal, will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last three matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They head to Fulham next Saturday before visiting Tottenham on May 14 and hosting West Ham five days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal cruised to a fourth successive victory, with Bukayo Saka's penalty putting them ahead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard slotted past Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers in the 70th minute before Declan Rice capped a dominant display by blasting home in stoppage-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chasing their first title since 2004, Arsenal's 26th Premier League victory this season equalled the club's top-flight record for a single campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was probably the best first half we've played all season," Gunners boss Mikel Arteta said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were unbelievable. Everything flowing, super composed on the ball. We generated so many chances, we could have gone three, four, five up easily."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal travel to Manchester United in their penultimate game next weekend before hosting Everton on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a huge blow as Newcastle ran riot in a 4-1 win at Turf Moor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vincent Kompany's second bottom side are five points from safety, with only two games left to avoid an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Callum Wilson put Newcastle ahead with a 19th minute tap-in and Sean Longstaff doubled their advantage in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Guimaraes made it three in the 40th minute with a powerful strike before Arijanet Muric saved Alexander Isak's 50th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isak made amends five minutes later when he grabbed his 20th league goal this season, making Dara O'Shea's 86th minute header no consolation for bedraggled Burnley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Bramall Lane, fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial breaches, are three points ahead of third bottom Luton, who drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West London rivals Brentford and Fulham shared a dour 0-0 draw. (AFP)

    Ipswich back in Premier League after 22 years

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ipswich returned to the Premier League for the first time in more than two decades after beating Huddersfield 2-0 to secure promotion from the Championship on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Wes Burns and Omari Hutchinson ensured the Tractor Boys became just the fourth side in the Premier League era to go from the third to the top tier via consecutive promotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds needed an Ipswich defeat coupled with victory over Southampton to leap into the top two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Daniel Farke's men lost 2-1 to Saints at Elland Road, meaning he will come up against old club Norwich in the playoff semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's most famous fan Ed Sheeran, who sponsors the club's shirts, was not in attendance for wild scenes of celebration at Portman Road as fans poured on to the pitch and lit blue flares at full-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Suffolk club, which was sold to American investors for just 40 million pounds (HK$391.96 million), will now pocket at least 200 million pounds in television revenue in the coming years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's rise was masterminded by boss Kieran McKenna, who has earned rave reviews in his first managerial role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenna failed to make the grade as a Tottenham player due to a hip injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 37-year-old thrived as a youth academy coach with Tottenham and then Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was promoted to help coach United's first-team by Jose Mourinho and retained that role under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford before joining Ipswich in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot, mostly seeing how much it means to everyone, the players, the supporters. To be one of the leaders of that is absolutely massive," McKenna said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a wonderful day, I'm very proud of everyone involved. It's what we've done all year. It's an incredible amount of effort." (AFP)

    Canelo and Munguia make weight ahead of title bout

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The commemorative boxing belt for the fight between Saul ''Canelo'' Alvarez and Jaime Munguia in Mexico City. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751812_1_20240504184541.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undisputed super-middleweight world champion Saul "Canelo" Alvarez and unbeaten Jaime Munguia both made weight Friday for their world boxing title showdown in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez, who will put his four super-middleweight belts on the line on Saturday, weighed in at 166.8 pounds (75.6kg) while fellow Mexican Munguia tipped the sales at 167.4 pounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighters greeted each other with respect on the stage in front of the T-Mobile Arena, where thousands of fans turned out to record the spectacle with their cell phones to the sound of mariachi music.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel really good," Alvarez said. "I feel in my prime. I feel in my best, because I've got no injuries anymore, so I feel my best right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll show you guys on Saturday night. I'm in my best shape -- ever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old champion had surgery on his left hand in 2022 after suffering the second loss of his career, against Dmitry Bivol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then,Alvarez has won three straight decisions but he hasn't added to his tally of knockouts and brings a record of 60-2-2 with 39 knockouts to the bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fight marks Alvarez's first since 2017 against a Mexican opponent, who has drawn plenty of fans himself for the bout coinciding with the Cinco de Mayo holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, who boasts a record of 43-0 with 34 knockouts, vowed to make the most of his opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I'm going to be world champion," said the 27-year-old from Tijuana, who has honed an explosive style under the guidance of trainer Freddie Roach, long-time trainer of Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promoters have hyped the encounter as a potential changing of the boxing guard, with Munguia poised to dethrone an opponent who made his professional debut way back in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unsurprisingly, Alvarez -- and oddsmakers -- see it differently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't care about experiences versus youth, I'm Canelo," Alvarez said this week, predicting a "decisive" victory in defence of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO world titles. (AFP)

    Care teams deployed after heavy rain hits Sai Kung

Care teams deployed after heavy rain hits Sai Kung
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751794_1_20240504160443.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said 12 care teams have been deployed to Sai Kung in response to the severe rainfall that hit the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At one point, the Observatory recorded over 200 millimetres of rain in the district, causing significant flooding on several roads, including Po Lam Road North and Wan Po Road in Tseung Kwan O, as well as Pak Sha Wan Street in Sai Kung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home affairs minister said some care team members were already on duty in temporary shelters while others were checking the district for floods and reporting to the Sai Kung district officer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also dismissed claims that some care team members didn't turn up when the rain was at its hardest on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Care team members are volunteers and they are fully dedicated to their work. However, during periods of heavy rainfall and when there are floods, the responsibility for addressing standing water and flooding falls to the government's professional departments,” she said. “I think the general public don’t expect care teams to deal with the floods without the necessary equipment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that most floods in the district had been dealt with before noon and most roads affected had been reopened by 2 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the Home Affairs Department had opened nine temporary shelters across Hong Kong for people in need of temporary accommodation.

    Turkey halts trade with Israel until Gaza ceasefire

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey said on Friday it will not resume trade with Israel, worth US$7 billion a year, until a permanent ceasefire and humanitarian aid are secured in Gaza, becoming the first of Israel's key commercial partners to take such a step.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's "uncompromising attitude" and the worsening situation in Gaza's Rafah region, a refuge for displaced people that Israel has threatened to storm - prompted Ankara to halt all exports and imports, Trade Minister Omer Bolat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz criticised Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's move, enacted late on Thursday, saying it breaks international trade agreements and was "how a dictator behaves".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, praised the decision as brave and supportive of Palestinian rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Turkey curbed exports of steel, fertiliser and jet fuel among 54 product categories over what it said was Israel's refusal to allow Ankara to take part in aid air-drop operations for Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new ban covers all remaining trade, amounting to US$5.4 billion in Turkish exports - or nearly 6 percent of all of Israel's imports - and US$1.6 billion in imports to Turkey last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top Turkish exports to Israel are steel, vehicles, plastics, electrical devices and machinery, while imports are dominated by fuels at US$634 million last year, Turkish trade data show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey has denounced Israel's military campaign in Gaza, sent thousands of tons of aid for Gazans and, this week, said it would join South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday awarded the country's top civilian honour to Oscar-winning Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh and 18 other people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a ceremony at the White House, the 81-year-old Biden presented Yeoh and other winners with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by placing the award around their necks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House praised Yeoh for continuing to "shatter stereotypes and enrich American culture," as the 61-year-old actress became the first Asian woman to win the best actress Oscar for her performance in "Everything Everywhere All at Once" last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners of the Presidential Medal of Freedom include Biden's Democratic allies - former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, former vice president Al Gore, former secretary of state John Kerry, and former New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the winners have made exemplary contributions to the US, and the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are the pinnacle of leadership in their fields. They consistently demonstrated over their careers the power of community, hard work, and service." Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden himself received the medal of freedom days before former US president Donald Trump entered the White House in January 2017. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the amber rainstorm warning signal at 8.45pm on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said heavy rain over Hong Kong had started to ease. The Observatory had issued the amber signal to replace the red rainstorm warning just before 4pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the forecaster has also warned that another intense band of thundery showers is edging towards the Pearl River Estuary, and this might still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The red signal had been in place since about 9 am and, at around noon, the Observatory warned it might issue its maximum black signal as even heavier rain started to fall across Hong Kong, especially in the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Drainage Services Department said it mobilised about 70 emergency response teams to handle flooding, involving over 160 emergency response teams comprising about 600 people. It said that by 7.30pm, all 16 flooding cases, including 12 in the Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O areas, had been resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geotechnical Engineering Office said it received 15 reports of landslides in the Sai Kung area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fire Services Department said that as of 7pm it had handled 25 reports of people trapped in lifts, and 71 reports from automatic fire alarm systems. It said fourteen people were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it received 22 reports of fallen trees with no injuries as of 8pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Home Affairs Department said it had opened nine temporary shelters located in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City in Kowloon, and Tseung Kwan O and Sai Kung in the New Territories.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday rescued two groups of hikers near Sai Kung, as heavy rain fell over Hong Kong, particularly in the east.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a group of 11 mainland tourists, including seven children, contacted police at about 11.30 am, after finding themselves stranded at High Island Reservoir East Dam. They had previously been camping in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about the same time, rescuers were also called in by four local hikers who found themselves in difficulty on section two of the MacLehose Trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said they were able to locate all of the stranded hikers, and evacuate them, adding that none of the 15 were injured and that they didn't require hospital treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory issued the first Red Rainstorm Signal of the year just before 9 am, before saying it was considering issuing the higher Black Rainstorm Signal at around noon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.30 am, the forecaster also issued a Landslip Warning, reminding people to stay away from steep slopes, and to stay at home.

    Dozens of cars damaged as TKO car park floods

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of cars were damaged by flood water at a car park in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday, as heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong, leading the Observatory to consider issuing a Black Rainstorm Warning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “For that particular outdoor car park area, there are around 450 cars. I think half of the cars were seriously [flooded]," said district councillor Christine Fong in an interview with RTHK. "Some of them, the water was up over the tyres, even up to the engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong also said the car park, on Wan Po Road in Lohas Park, didn't have a reputation for flooding so many drivers had been caught out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the east of the SAR had borne the brunt of the rainfall with over 200 millimetres of rain falling in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Road flooding in those two areas also meant that only limited services could be provided at two out-patient clinics there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department says it has opened temporary shelters for people in need of temporary accommodation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Observatory had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am following a night of rain, leading to the suspension of classes at all schools.

New minimum wage formula to protect labour: Sun

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said the new minimum wage formula will provide support to Hong Kong's 17,000 low income workers, who currently earn an hourly rate of HK$40.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new formula - which bars any reduction - takes effect next year, after being given the go-ahead on Tuesday by the Chief Executive, John Lee, and the Executive Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the reform balanced the interests of both labour and employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has taken into account, on the one hand, the need to protect those earning a minimum wage, that their wage is being protected; and also, at the same time, to ensure that the formula is affordable, and also acceptable to the business sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the labour minister told an RTHK radio programme that the government would enhance safety awareness following the deaths of two sewer maintenance workers, who are believed to have been exposed to toxic gas in a manhole last week in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stated that new guidelines for those working in confined spaces, to be announced this month, will make it mandatory to install CCTV at the entrance and exit of manholes.

    Restaurants see 10pc drop in business on May 1 holiday

Restaurants see 10pc drop in business on May 1 holiday

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Catering sector representative Simon Wong on Saturday said restaurants saw 10 percent less business than usual this May 1 public holiday, which was also the first day of the mainland's Golden Week break.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades president said this was partially due to 20,000 fewer mainland arrivals on that day, although the May 1 firework display had helped trade near Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see that business in some areas in Hong Kong - like in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, and along the harbour - because of the fireworks, recorded some increase," he said. "I did visit several districts in Hong Kong and saw that there were not too many people visiting shopping malls.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that reduced spending power among individual travellers and the bad weather during the week contributed to the lower sales. He also attributed the lower sales to many locals heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a hotel group says the occupancy rate for its two hotels also dropped about six to seven percent when compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Chan, the operations officer of Miramar Group, said the group had offered substantial price discounts to retain hotel guests, with prices per night decreasing by approximately 23 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the hotel industry, if we need to drop prices by 23 percent to retain a certain occupancy rate, I think it’s not really ideal,” he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that this year, many mainland flights had resumed to other countries, and visa requirements had also been relaxed for mainlanders, giving them more travel options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan urged the government to liaise with mainland authorities to further expand the Individual Visit Scheme so more mainlanders could visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day mainland holiday will conclude on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Immigration Department, arrivals on May 1 reached 460,000, with over 180,000 coming from the mainland.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday said it may issue the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, as heavy rain continues to batter Hong Kong, particularly in the east of the territory. It had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am, as the rainy weather that has hit Hong Kong over the past few days worsened.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O have seen very heavy rain with the Observatory saying more than 200 millimetres have been recorded and that severe rainstorms would continue to affect the eastern part of the SAR. It also warned people to stay away from watercourses across the territory due to the possibility of flash floods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Hospital Authority spokesman for the Kowloon East Cluster said road flooding meant only limited services could be provided at the Mona Fong General Out-patient Clinic in Sai Kung and the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the government had called on the public to report flooding to the Drainage Services Department following wet weather overnight. There have been reports of flooding and a fallen tree in Chai Wan, and flooding on Silver Cape Road in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools have also been told to make sure conditions are safe before allowing students to leave, while all classes have been suspended for the afternoon
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also told employers to make arrangements for staff.

    Hui flags SAR's strength as a wealth management centre

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says that the government is taking steps to enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness as a wealth management and capital formation centre in order to consolidate the city's position as a leading global financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address programme, he noted that one of the key measures introduced was the Capital Entrant Admission Scheme, which allows individuals with capital of more than HK$30 million to become permanent residents after residing in in Hong Kong for seven years. This scheme has received a positive response, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He discussed efforts to facilitate capital formation, including the reduction of stamp duty for the stock market and the reform of the Growth Enterprise Board, which focuses mainly on small and medium-sized enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a very competitive edge as the equity and also bond raising platform for different corporates. So in that context, we have a number of measures laid out and actually implemented phase by phase to enhance the appeal of our capital market," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stressed that amid global geopolitical changes, people are looking for ways to diversify their assets, adding that Hong Kong can seize the opportunities arising from these challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the city is a very attractive option for individuals to invest their capital and channel investments through Hong Kong to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a wealth management and capital formation centre was evident with more than 2,700 single-family offices already established in the city.

    HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training

HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751619_1_20240503121227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) is launching a new round of its overseas training sponsorship programme, fully subsidising eligible participants to earn a bachelor's degree in podiatry at the University of Northampton in the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The scheme to send people abroad for training on foot treatment was first introduced in 2005 due to the lack of recognised programmes among local tertiary institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stanley Wan, who works as a resident podiatrist at Yan Chai Hospital, participated in the programme in 2014 and joined the HA in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had graduated with an engineering degree, but decided to switch to a new career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In terms of my profile, I think I'm not really as good as other competitors, which could possibly already have a degree related to chemistry or bio-engineering,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think I showed the interviewer that I have great determination of preparing myself. I applied for the course of physiology, trying to learn something that I probably [did not] know before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also I participated in my church activities, which mainly serve the elderly.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two or three places are on offer each year, and successful applicants must commit to working for the HA for at least five years upon graduation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priscilla Poon, the HA's chief manager of allied health, said applicants actually find the requirement attractive because Hong Kong doesn't have its own podiatry registration process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it's a kind of encouragement to them… For those graduates who have graduated in the UK – despite the fact that they are able to register in the UK – [but because] there’s no registration in Hong Kong, there won't be any guarantee of job opportunities,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But if we ask them to serve in HA at least for five years, I think that will be a very positive message for them… they're still able to get a very good pay and a very good job opportunity in HA.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poon said the HA currently employs 54 podiatrists, but lost about 5 percent of staff each year in recent years due to retirement or resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while the current staff level is sufficient, Hong Kong's ageing population is expected to increase the demand for podiatrists further.

    Jobs and Apple send Wall Street surging

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three main Wall Street indexes closed higher. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751718_1_20240504044643.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street surged to a higher close on Friday as a softer-than-expected employment report bolstered the case for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve while also providing evidence of US economic resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock posted robust gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the pack, rising 2 percent with an assist from Apple shares following the iPhone maker's record share buyback announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes notched their second straight Friday-to-Friday gains, capping a week in which markets were encouraged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's more dovish-than-expected statements following Wednesday's rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's employment report showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked higher and wage growth unexpectedly cooled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report likely hit the sweet spot for the Fed, offering signs the labor market is softening, which Powell has deemed necessary to put inflation on a sustainable downward path. The report also provided assurances on US economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report prompted investors to raise bets the Fed would implement its first rate reduction in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investor narrative remains the Fed and interest rates and today’s weak jobs report puts rate cuts firmly on the Fed’s 2024 agenda," said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments in New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials weighed in on the data. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her willingness to hike rates if inflation progress reverses, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the employment report boosted confidence the economy is not overheating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple surged 6.0 percent, after the company unveiled a record US$110 billion share buyback program and beat quarterly expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travel platform Expedia cut its full-year revenue growth forecast, sending its shares sliding 15.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18 percent, to 38,676, the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent, to 5,128 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.99 percent, to 16,156. (Reuters)

    Canada charges Indian trio over Sikh activist murder

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police said on Friday they had arrested and charged three Indian nationals with the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 and said they were probing possible links to the Indian government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said the matter was still under investigation and other probes were being carried out. These "include investigating connections to the government of India," he told a televised news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a "terrorist".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States. (Reuters)

 The Los Angeles Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on Friday after two seasons and a 90-74 regular-season record.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We greatly appreciate Darvin's efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons including last year's remarkable run to the Western Conference finals," general manager Rob Pelinka said in a team-released statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all want to thank Darvin for his dedication and positivity. While this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season. This organisation will remain unwavering in its commitment to deliver championship-calibre basketball to Lakers fans around the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers finished the regular season with a 47-35 mark, good enough for only an eighth-place finish in the Western Conference. They defeated the New Orleans Pelicans in the play-in round to earn the No 7 seed in the playoffs but were bounced by the Denver Nuggets in the opening round, 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets also defeated the Lakers last season in the conference finals on the way to their first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had seemed optimistic in Lakers land when the team roared to the title in the NBA in-season tournament with a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers at Las Vegas on December 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a 3-9 stretch followed, and reports emerged of growing unrest between the players and Ham, 50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers hired Ham on June 3, 2022, to replace Frank Vogel following a 33-49 record in 2021-22, two years removed from winning the NBA championship. It was Ham's first NBA head coaching job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lakers fans chanted "Fire Darvin Ham" in Game 3 of the series with the Nuggets. After the game, All-Star Anthony Davis said the Lakers "don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor" for stretches of games. (Reuters)

 Torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and landslides across Kenya in recent weeks, killing at least 210 people, are forecast to worsen over the rest of this month, President William Ruto said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The floods have wreaked havoc, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure across Kenya, East Africa's largest economy. The death toll exceeds that from floods triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon late last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sadly, we have not seen the last of this perilous period, as the situation is expected to escalate. Meteorological reports paint a dire picture," Ruto said on Kenyan television. "Kenya may face its first-ever cyclone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclone Hidaya is expected to make landfall in Tanzania, Kenya's southern neighbour, on Saturday, bringing with it waves almost eight metres high and 165 kph winds, the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Floods have killed more than 160 people in Tanzania since the beginning of April, Tanzania's government spokesman Mobhare Matinyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This cyclone, named Hidaya, that could hit anytime now, is predicted to cause torrential rain, strong winds and powerful and dangerous waves," Ruto said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Ruto ordered those living in landslide-prone areas to leave for safer ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has asked people living near 178 dams and water reservoirs, now close to overflowing, as well as those in informal settlements close to rivers and streams, to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said the reopening of all schools for the upcoming term, which was meant to start this week, would be postponed until further notice. (Reuters)

 Uefa have agreed to increase squad sizes from 23 to 26 players for the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, European football's governing body said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  International managers had voiced concerns when a return to the pre-Covid-19 23-player limit had been confirmed by Uefa, after it was increased to 26 for Euro 2020 and World Cup 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Uefa Executive Committee has today decided to increase the maximum squad size of the teams participating in the upcoming Uefa Euro 2024 from the original quota of 23 to 26 players," a Uefa statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The increase does not represent an obligation for the participating national associations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participating countries have until June 7 to provide Uefa with a squad list containing a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26. (Reuters)
