<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden confirmed its first case of the viral infection mpox on Thursday, which was also the first case outside Africa, a day after the WHO declared the disease a global public health emergency for the second time in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The person was infected while staying in a part of Africa where there was a large outbreak of the disease, Olivia Wigzell, director-general at the Swedish Public Health Agency, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation made its announcement over mpox, which spreads through close contact, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries of a more serious type of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I," Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed told the press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigzell said the person who was infected had received care and instructions in line with the health agency's recommendations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The case is the first caused by Clade I that has been diagnosed outside the African continent. The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade I," she said. (Reuters)

    Five charged over death of 'Friends' actor Perry

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A floral tribute to Matthew Perry left by a fan in New York. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766362_2_20240816012519.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Criminal charges have been filed against five people in connection with the death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry nearly a year ago, law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defendants include two doctors and an assistant to Perry who were part of "a broad underground criminal network" that distributed large quantities of the prescription drug ketamine to the actor and others, US Attorney Martin Estrada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These defendants took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves," Estrada said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry died at age 54 from "acute effects" of ketamine, a powerful sedative, in addition to other factors that caused the actor to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub last October, an autopsy said. For months, Los Angeles homicide detectives and federal agents have been investigating how Perry obtained the prescription drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A December 2023 autopsy report concluded Perry died from the "acute effects of ketamine," which combined with other factors caused the actor to lose consciousness and slip below the water in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toxicology tests found Perry's body contained dangerously high levels of ketamine, a short-acting anesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Typically, people with that much ketamine in their systems are in general aesthesia during surgery, and being monitored by professionals, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other contributing factors in his death were drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of the opioid-addiction medicine buprenorphine, which was also detected in his system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of drug and alcohol abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends." He had been sober for 19 months with no known relapses before his death, according to interviews cited in his autopsy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witness interviews in the autopsy report said he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, so the ketamine found in his system by medical examiners would have been introduced since that last infusion, the autopsy said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda pair of Ying Ying and Le Le have finally produced babies, after they successfully mated in March this year at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After five months of pregnancy, Ying Ying gave birth to one female and one male in the small hours of Thursday. Ocean Park, where the giant panda lives, said she spent much of her time lying on the ground and twisting, and that she was in labour for more than five hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ocean Park Hong Kong is thrilled to welcome the birth of the first-ever giant panda twins in Hong Kong," the amusement park said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This birth is a true rarity, especially considering Ying Ying is the oldest giant panda on record to have successfully given birth for the first time," the park said, adding that she gave birth just one day before her 19th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilise, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth. Currently, both babies are under 24-hour intensive care by the park’s animal care and veterinary team, as well as experts from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee called the birth of the panda twins a very special occasion, and thanked the nation for having gifted Ying Ying and Le Le to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Ocean Park's team for taking good care of the city's giant pandas and experts from the research centre for their support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested the driver of a tram involved in a fatal crash that killed a three-year-old girl in Western District on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tram was travelling along the eastbound track of Praya, Kennedy Town at 10.40am, officers said. But when it approached the pedestrian crossing near Des Voeux Road West, it reportedly knocked down four people who were crossing the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year-old girl was trapped under the tram and was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital in an unconscious state. She was certified dead at about 12.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A six-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man also sustained injuries and were sent to the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 48-year-old male driver on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and that he is currently being detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For their part, Hong Kong Tramways said that according to their preliminary understanding, the tram was operating as usual when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that they suspended the driver after the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it is very concerned about the incident and that it has asked the tramway operator to investigate it in detail and submit a report as soon as possible.

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s populist Pheu Thai party on Thursday nominated its party chief, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, in a Parliament vote for the country’s new leader after former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was removed by a court order over an ethical violation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn said she was ready to work for the country to move it forward and promised give her best, after securing her candidacy for prime minister by the governing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined, together and will push the country forward," she told a press conference ahead of Friday's parliamentary vote on a new premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is seen as force behind Pheu Thai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the first Thai politician ever to win an overall majority of seats. The residual popularity of Thaksin is a factor in the support for Paetongtarn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Paetongtarn is approved by Parliament's vote she would become Thailand’s second female prime minister, and the country’s third leader from the Shinwatra family after her father and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population fell by 0.1 percent between mid-2023 and the middle of 2024, according to government estimates released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures by the Census and Statistics Department showed that the SAR's population slid from 7,536,100 in mid-2023, to 7,531,800 in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the territory saw a net outflow of 30,200 residents, but 44,000 one-way permit holders came to the SAR, resulting in a net inflow of 13,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the population saw a small increase in the first half of 2024 due to the introduction of various government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Benefiting from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation, there was sizeable inflow of persons from the mainland and other places around the world to Hong Kong in the first half of 2024," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Yip, a population expert from the University of Hong Kong, said authorities had to work on retaining talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to make the people who decided to come to Hong Kong, stay in Hong Kong...I think we also have to diversify our portfolio. Not only from mainland China, we also like to attract, some foreign talent from other places too," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to make Hong Kong to be a truly cosmopolitan city, I think we do need talent to come from different places, [like] the Belt and Road countries and also Europe or the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures showed that Hong Kong saw 34,400 births last year, a five percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies, along with other proposals to promote births, was announced in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said the policies announced last October might not be reflected in the official data yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be very interesting to see whether there would be any substantial increase in 2024. But I think even if there is any impact, it will be quite limited," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's largest food festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Thursday, with enthusiastic bargain hunters racing inside as the doors opened at 10am sharp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some of the visitors to Food Expo said they had queued up overnight just to snap up bargains or freebies, such as ready-to-eat abalone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were looking to rediscover old favourites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We bought some Taiwanese rice flour noodles, because we went to Taiwan before so I just want my kids to try again," said a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourists were also at the exhibition centre to sample new flavours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just got some coffee and some coffee beans. I'm from Australia so we really like coffee over there. I've got some peanut chocolate butter as well, that's really nice. Hadn't seen that before," Andrew Frank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully the customs doesn't take it away from me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vendors, on the other hand, seized the chance to learn about the preferences of local customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Illugi Gunnarsson, who distributes Icelandic farm products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very good opportunity for us to meet people from Hong Kong, really see how they react to our products. But it also gives us an opportunity to sell, of course we like that, but mainly to understand our customers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau, meanwhile, underlined the contribution the convention and exhibition industry makes to the SAR's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The convention and exhibition industry has always been crucial to Hong Kong's economy by attracting high-spending overnight business visitors to Hong Kong, spurring economic activities and creating employment opportunities," Yau remarked at an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am glad to know that this week's fairs have gathered over 1,800 high-quality exhibitors from 28 countries and regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expo will take place until Monday.

    Japan lowers megaquake warning

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan lifted on Thursday a week-old warning that a "megaquake", potentially causing colossal damage and loss of life could strike, with the government telling people their lives could now "go back to normal".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alert that such a catastrophe might hit the archipelago of 125 million people prompted thousands of Japanese to cancel holidays and stock up on essentials, emptying shelves in some stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there were no abnormalities detected in seismic activity and crustal deformation, the special call for attention ended at 5pm," disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it doesn't mean the risk [of a major earthquake] has been eliminated," Matsumura told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been asking for special precautions, such as sleeping while being prepared to evacuate immediately. But we will no longer ask for these steps, and the people of Japan are free to go back to normal lifestyles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Thursday, Japan's weather agency said the likelihood of a megaquake was "higher than normal" following a magnitude 7.1 jolt earlier in the day that injured 15 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a particular kind of tremor known as a subduction megathrust quake, which in the past has occurred in pairs and can unleash massive tsunamis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advisory concerned the Nankai Trough between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 800-kilometre undersea gully runs parallel to Japan's Pacific coast, including off the Tokyo region, the world's biggest urban area and home to around 40 million people. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Thursday said it recorded about four million visitor arrivals in July, with about half involving overnight stays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure was a 10 percent increase on the same month last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 80 percent of July's visitors came from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said Hong Kong received about 25 million visitors in the first seven months of this year, over 50 percent more than the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the city held several events, including drone shows and pyrotechnic displays, adding that a survey of tourists found more than 90 percent believed the drone shows had enhanced their visit experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said it will organise drone shows and pyrotechnic displays during Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas and New Year's Eve, and will stage a new year countdown fireworks performance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association on Thursday said it welcomed a possible relaxation of the eligibility criteria for a talent attraction programme, saying it would draw more professionals to the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the moment, graduates of the world's top 100 universities are eligible to move to the SAR under the scheme. On Monday, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government is considering expanding the list of universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who founded the association, said at a press briefing that an expansion would boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This plan would give more support to Hong Kong's economy, and provide more and more entrepreneurs coming to Hong Kong and make more startups in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang also urged the government to offer more support to the children of professionals arriving in Hong Kong through the programme, saying they might encounter challenges when adapting to a new educational environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called on employers to provide housing allowances to incoming professionals due to accommodation costs in the city.

    NGOs urged to spend more on cybersecurity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Francis Fong says NGOs should treat cybersecurity as a recurring expense. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766262_1_20240815122329.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An IT expert on Thursday urged NGOs, schools, and hospitals to prioritise cybersecurity spending, warning they are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This advice came after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data estimated that roughly 470,000 people's personal data was stolen in a cyberattack against Oxfam Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, the honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation and an Oxfam council member, told RTHK the council had instructed team members to notify all affected individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong explained that a key reason NGOs were prone to attacks was because of widespread work-from-home practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the pandemic because we used to work from home...We normally use a VPN to get into the office server so you can work remotely. But the problem is if you have not updated the firmware of the firewall, the VPN, the OS of the workstation server, even your antivirus or your security software, there are possibly many loopholes the hackers can attack the network and get the data from the server.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said staff awareness was lacking, noting many attacks were caused by employees tapping on suspicious web links or phishing emails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong pointed to the need for a shift in organisations’ mindsets over cybersecurity spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the past, we all thought this was just like one-off expense for security measures, but now because of so many attacks, these expenses [should] become like a regular expense, at least like a yearly expense,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So you should actually update all your servers. You have to buy subscriptions of your firewall and your security software, so that you are being properly protected, and you have to do security audits at least once a year.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments on Thursday signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in areas such as conservation and pollution control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pact was signed during a ceremony at the University of Hong Kong to mark National Ecology Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement is also aimed at stepping up joint efforts to combat climate change, ecological promotion and education, as well as preserving biodiversity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said the SAR government has always tried its best to preserve nature, as part of efforts to build a beautiful China and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always stressed the need for people to co-exist with nature and adheres to President Xi Jinping's philosophy that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively setting up the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, which would be five times larger than the current wetland park. This would enhance the biodiversity and quality of the natural habitat in the Deep Bay area," Cheuk said in a speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also enhances the environmental capacity of the Northern Metropolis and achieves the co-existence of development and conservation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that over the next fortnight, the administration will team up with dozens of non-governmental organisations to hold a number of activities encouraging conservation, including free ecological tours and free admission to facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Shenzhen top official on natural resources, Xu Songming, said the pact between the two governments will allow a new level of mutual governance and sharing on ecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Shenzhen has always learned from Hong Kong's good example in terms of environmental protection, calling the SAR "the world's model city" for its green and low carbon developments.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's factory output growth slowed and missed expectations in July, but consumption figures were better than expected for that period.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales rebounded in July while industrial production growth slowed, official data showed Thursday, highlighting an uneven recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Industrial output grew 5.1 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, slowing from the 5.3 percent pace in June and below expectations for a 5.2 percent increase in a Reuters poll of analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the NBS' monthly activity indicators showed retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.7 percent in July, quickening from a two percent increase in June and beating expectations for growth of 2.6 percent, a sign efforts to boost household spending were getting some traction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the jobs front, China's labour market remained stable in the January-July period as the surveyed urban unemployment rate dropped on a year-on-year basis, according to NBS data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average of surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first seven months of 2024, down 0.2 percentage points from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July alone, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, up from five percent in June but still lower than 5.3 percent a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts warn the broader outlook remained challenging for policymakers, suggesting more stimulus measures will be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data shows that the economy has gotten off to a weak start in the second half of the year, and it is expected that the probability of replacing MLF with a RRR cut will increase, but key to maintaining five percent economic growth remains the arrival of fiscal spending," said ANZ China market economist Xing Zhaopeng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was referring to the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending facility and reserve requirement ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the central bank injected cash through a short-term bond instrument and said it would conduct an MLF rollover later this month as it extends liquidity support to the financial system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's central bank at a meeting earlier this month said it would step up financial support to the broader economy and efforts would be directed more at consumers to spur consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with domestic demand weak and the outlook unclear, households and businesses are in no rush to borrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for more growth boosting measures have dogged officials ever since a widely expected post-pandemic recovery failed to materialise in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded 3.6 percent in the first seven months of 2024 year-on-year, but also missed expectations for a 3.9 percent rise and also slowed from the 3.9 percent growth in the January to June period. (Agencies and Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned, coming nearly four months after the Ivy League university was rocked by campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766252_1_20240815105933.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the prestigious New York college grapple with protests over the Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions related to the conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anti-war protests and encampments at Columbia and campuses across the United States were a flashpoint in debates about US support for Israel in its campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics said the protests at Columbia and elsewhere veered into anti-Semitism and intimidation, culminating in Shafik being questioned before the US Congress along with other university presidents and accused of not keeping Jewish students safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters -- many of whom were themselves Jewish -- said demonstrators' anti-Israel views were being conflated with anti-Semitism. They also said that individual allegations of hate incidents were being used to distract from calls for a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead," Shafik wrote in an email announcing the move, according to student newspaper the Columbia Spectator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am making this announcement now so that new leadership can be in place before the new term begins."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests and encampments spread across US universities, protesters at times occupied buildings. In some cases there were clashes with police, while at other times pro-Israel protesters attacked the encampments. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rookie road rider Puck Pieterse clung on to win stage four of the Tour de France Femmes in Liege on Wednesday, with compatriot Demi Vollering taking second in a photo finish to conserve the yellow jersey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first-ever road race victory for the 22-year-old cross-discipline star Pieterse at her first Tour de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result lifted the Dutch rider to second overall, and gave her the best young rider's white jersey and the polka dot climb jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To take the win here, in a sprint ahead of Demi, it's really a dream coming true," said Pieterse. "They were riding for the general classification. I'm just here for the stage. I'm fresh. I just tried to keep a poker face and take it from the sprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering, meanwhile, held onto the leader's yellow jersey she pulled on after Tuesday's time-trial in Rotterdam. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé enjoyed a "great night" as he struck on his Real Madrid debut to help his new side claim a record sixth Uefa Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Atalanta on Wednesday in Warsaw.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The superstar French forward has waited years to play for his dream club and after finally signing for Los Blancos this summer at the end of his Paris Saint-Germain deal, celebrated his first appearance with a goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fede Valverde broke the deadlock from close range for the Champions League holders in the 59th minute after the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid began to rack up the chances and Mbappé rifled home in the 68th minute after Jude Bellingham spotted his dart into space in the box to seal the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great night, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, to play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans," Mbappé said, speaking in fluent Spanish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's triumph ensured coach Carlo Ancelotti equalled former Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz on a joint-record 14 titles won at the helm of the club.

    Lower inflation boosts Wall Street

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 ended higher on Wednesday, stretching its winning streak to five sessions, as the latest inflation data reassured investors betting the Federal Reserve would start cutting US interest rates next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also posted its fifth straight daily gain, although it barely scraped into positive territory as Alphabet and some megacap tech stocks weighed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moves were generally subdued with many investors away for August vacations, and new triggers for trading were absent, contributing to an overall listless picture among the benchmarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest US consumer price data, released earlier on Wednesday, reinforced expectations that the Fed would start interest rate cuts in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumer prices rose moderately in July, and the annual increase in inflation slowed to below 3 percent for the first time since early 2021. A day earlier, softer-than-expected producer prices data indicated inflation continued to moderate, although not yet all the way to the US central bank's 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments, said he called days such as this "markets violently going nowhere", adding with CPI painting a similar picture to PPI data, there was no reason for traders to reassess moves put in place on the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no huge rationale to move prices one way or another," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 closed at 5,455, up 0.38 percent. The Nasdaq Composite closed at 17,193, up 0.03 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.61 percent at 40,008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Alphabet, the Google-parent, dropped 2.3 percent on a media report that the US Department of Justice is considering options that include breaking up the online search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other megacaps were mixed: Tesla slumped 3.1 percent and Meta Platforms dropped 0.3 percent, while Microsoft fell 0.7 percent and Nvidia declined 1.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rebound in megacap and tech stocks has helped markets recoup most losses from a global market rout early this month after data showed the U.S. unemployment rate surged in July. (Reuters)

    Mars swallows Pringles maker in US$36bn deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pringles will now be part of a snack empire that also includes Mars products. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766209_1_20240815034438.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family-owned candy giant Mars is buying Cheez-It maker Kellanova in a nearly US$36 billion deal, bringing together brands from M&M's and Snickers to Pringles and Pop-Tarts in the year's biggest deal to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mars said on Wednesday it will pay US$83.50 per share for Kellanova, representing about a 33 percent premium to its closing price on August 2 before it was first reported that Mars was exploring a deal for the maker of frozen breakfast foods, such as Morningstar Farms and Eggo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal is a bet on consumers continuing to indulge in branded snacks, and comes as packaged food companies face stalling growth after years of price hikes to cover sky-rocketing inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The combined company aims to hold prices steady, said Mars CEO Poul Weihrauch, and not pass on costs from the deal to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a big and stronger company," Weihrauch said. "We hope to be able to absorb more costs in our structure and help alleviate the issues we have in an inflationary environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food prices in the United States increased roughly 25 percent from 2019 through 2023, far more than other categories such as housing and medical care, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture. But inflation has started to moderate, according to the US consumer price index data released on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumers in the United States and Europe – major markets for both companies – have been looking for cheaper alternatives or ditching brands for cheaper private label goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kellanova has seen private label encroach on its market share for cereal in Europe and other areas, said CEO Steve Cahillane. The company sells sweet cereals such as Smacks, Frosties and Coco Pops in Europe, according to securities filings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US packaged food sector is seeing robust dealmaking as companies seek scale to weather the impact of inflation-weary consumers cutting back and shifting their purchases to private label brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think an environment more conducive to deal-making could also encourage some of the large-cap packaged food names within the industry to shift their focus away from portfolio cleanup and divestiture efforts and towards a more offensive, acquisition-led posture with a focus on growth," Barclays analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday. (Reuters)

    WHO declares mpox a global health emergency

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determining a disease outbreak as a "public health emergency of international concern" or PHEIC – the WHO's highest level of alert – can accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and co-operation to contain a disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact. It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Africa's top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,000 suspected mpox cases and 517 deaths have been reported on the African continent so far this year, a 160 percent increase in cases compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. A total of 13 countries have reported cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A different form of the mpox virus – clade IIb – spread globally in 2022, largely through sexual contact among men who have sex with men. This prompted the WHO to declare a public health emergency then, which it ended 10 months later. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult the Palestinian group afterwards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US has said it expects indirect talks to go ahead as planned in Qatar's capital Doha on Thursday, and that a ceasefire agreement was still possible, while warning that progress was needed urgently to avert a wider war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Axios reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed a trip to the Middle East that had been expected to begin on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three senior Iranian officials have said that only a ceasefire deal in Gaza would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel will send the negotiations team on the agreed upon date, that's tomorrow August 15th, in order to finalise the details of the implementation of the framework agreement," government spokesperson David Mencer said in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation includes Israel's spy chief David Barnea, head of the domestic security service Ronen Bar and the military's hostages chief Nitzan Alon, a defence official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has voiced scepticism about the chances of the talks delivering real results, blaming Israel for stalling, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been the main obstacle to sealing a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to new negotiations allows the occupation to impose new conditions and employ the maze of negotiation to conduct more massacres," Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas' absence from the talks, however, does not eliminate the chances of progress since its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya is based in Doha and the group has open channels with Egypt and Qatar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas is committed to the proposal presented to it on July 2, which is based on the UN Security Council resolution and the Biden speech and the movement is prepared to immediately begin discussion over a mechanism to implement it," said Abu Zuhri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source familiar with the matter said that Hamas wants the mediators to come back to them with a "serious response" from Israel. If that happens, the group says, it will meet mediators after the Thursday session. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The infrastructure arm of Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison conglomerate announced on Wednesday that it would put in place a secondary share listing on the London Stock Exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure Holdings said in an announcement that it had sought permission from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and expected to begin trading in its shares on the London bourse’s main market on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The company believes that a listing in London, in addition to the Company’s listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will benefit its geographically diverse shareholder base and will assist in building the company’s profile and provide a greater market for trading in the shares,” CK said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has been appointed to manage the listing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company noted that Britain was its largest market, with 35.7 percent of profit attributable to shareholders coming from the UK last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company had earlier announced a 2 percent increase in earnings for the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure also announced that it was buying a portfolio of windfarms in the UK for HK$3.5 billion, its third acquisition of the year.

    Govt condemns Patten's remarks on top court ruling

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it strongly condemned remarks made by the last governor of colonial Hong Kong regarding a recent Court of Final Appeal ruling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chris Patten, writing in the Guardian newspaper, described the top court's decision to uphold the convictions of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019, as "unjust".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the verdict was "made worse" because David Neuberger, a former president of Britain's supreme court, was a party to the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SAR administration said it opposed the former governor's "malicious slandering" against the verdict and his "wanton personal vilifications" against Lord Neuberger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patten's slandering remarks were made in blatant disregard of the detailed legal analysis by the [Court of Final Appeal] in its 76-page judgement and the factual background of the relevant case," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such remarks were made for the sole purpose of exerting political pressure on the judges ... in an attempt to influence the judicial system of the [Hong Kong SAR], and were nothing but a despicable political manoeuvre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said Patten's criticisms against Neuberger were "completely groundless and unjustified personal attacks" aimed at smearing his reputation and undermining the system of non-permanent judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone has the right to express his or her views on court decisions within the boundaries permitted by the law, but no one can abusively criticise or slander judges, or make baseless allegations purely out of political motives," the spokesperson added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethnic minority pupils in Hong Kong who embarked on a mainland study tour under a new visa-free scheme said they had acquired much knowledge about the country's culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of more than 20 students from Yaumati Kaifong Association School returned to the SAR after a three-day trip across Guangdong province, designed to foster a deeper understanding of the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They learnt about martial arts, paper-cutting and Chinese calligraphy, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really enjoyed Chinese calligraphy. It's fun, beautiful and creative," said nine-year-old Dangal Zane, who learnt to write the Chinese character for "family".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now I know more about Chinese culture and arts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her schoolmate Limbu Maeson, 12, said the trip inspired him to contemplate living across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, maybe I'll decide to work there, because there are a lot of businesses," he said. "I feel like the education is more intense in China, because of the exams. Besides that, maybe it will be a good shot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maeson, just like others on the exchange tour, crossed the border using a new travel permit for permanent residents with foreign passports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time when we went to China, it took way longer and we were stressed out about what if we didn't make it," he said, adding that it only took him a minute to pass through immigration this time round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Ka-ho, a school manager who led the tour, had nothing but praise for the new travel scheme for non-Chinese SAR residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, they did not even have the chance to sign up for an exchange tour due to the lack of a permit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But that's not the case anymore. They could sign up for these tours ... so that they have more opportunities to take part in the country's development and observe the progress by travelling to the mainland."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting from July, Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens can apply for a five-year permit to enter the mainland for short-term purposes such as business, tourism and exchanges.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Food Expo returns on Thursday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, as vendors remain hopeful about sales amid the changing spending habits of local consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, nearly half a million people thronged the five-day extravaganza, with the organiser, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, saying they spent an average of $1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the recent trend of Hongkongers spending their weekends in Shenzhen and other parts of Guangdong Province has threatened local businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's marketing associate director, Eddie Lee, pointed out they've done a lot to promote this year's event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing a lot of promotion to communicate the selling point, and the highlights of our expos to...not just our local audience, and by these promotional activities in nearby areas, the Greater Bay Area, we hope also to attract visitors from our nearby cities to visit Hong Kong and participate in our fairs," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the 34th edition of the popular event will be held in conjunction with three other expos, featuring vendors specialising in tea, beauty and wellness products and home appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Admission costs $30 per adult, or $10 if they enter before noon on weekdays or after 6pm every night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An extra $10 is charged for those who wish to enter the "gourmet zone" where visitors are offered a taste of delicacies from around the world, including French foie gras, Australian abalone and Japanese vinegar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tencent has posted a 72 percent year-on-year increase in interim net profit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  First-half earnings at the Chinese internet giant reached 89.5 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not offering an interim dividend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Net profit for the April-June period, meanwhile, jumped 82 percent from a year ago to 47.6 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter revenue climbed 8 percent to 161.1 billion yuan, driven by a recovery in its gaming business after a launch of a new mobile game in May that got off to a strong start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long-awaited "Dungeon & Fighter Mobile" title dominated top-grossing charts on Apple's iOS platform in China for nearly a month after its release, according to industry data. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Cyclothon will be revamped this year, with new routes and a sports-themed carnival being introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's largest cycling event will return on October 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 50-kilometre race will go through the Sha Tin Heights Tunnel, while the 32-kilometre event will cross Ting Kau Bridge for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both races will start in Tsim Sha Tsui and end at the Jordan Road Flyover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Chan, the board's general manager of event and product development, said a carnival will be held in the West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's actually very important for us to add more different elements to our Hong Kong Cyclothon," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for a lot of cyclists, after they finish their 50-kilometre or 32-kilometre [race], it will be actually good for them to have some relaxing experiences, either a dance class, yoga class or stretching class. It's a good hangout place for them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Registration for the cyclothon opens at 10am on August 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The board said it will accept more than 6,000 registrations in total this year – 800 more than last year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday as it ruled against him in an ethics case. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766160_1_20240814165201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who served jail time, raising the spectre of more political upheaval and a reset of the governing alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I respect the verdict. I reiterate that for the almost one year I have been in this role, I have tried with good intentions to lead the country with honesty," Srettha told reporters outside his office after the court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real estate tycoon Srettha becomes the fourth Thai premier in 16 years to be removed by verdicts by the same court, after it ruled he violated the constitution by appointing a minister who did not meet ethical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's removal after less than a year in power means parliament must convene to choose a new premier, with the prospect of more uncertainty in a country dogged for two decades by coups and court rulings that have brought down multiple governments and political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same court last week dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party, the hugely popular opposition, ruling its campaign to reform a law against insulting the crown risked undermining the constitutional monarchy. It regrouped on Friday under a new party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors have borne the brunt of Thailand's turmoil, with two of its governments removed by coups in a long-running grudge match between the party's founders, the billionaire Shinawatra family, and their rivals in the conservative establishment and royalist military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision could rock a fragile truce between political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra and his enemies among the conservative elite and military old guard, which enabled the tycoon's return from 15 years of self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board. The bribery allegation was never proven and Pichit resigned in May.
  <br/>

  Deputy premier Phumtham Wechayachai is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple supplier Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent rise in second-quarter net profit, driven by strong AI server demand as the company touted "strong growth momentum" from the technology boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's largest contract electronics maker, said net profit for the April-June quarter rose to US$1.09 billion from US$1.02 billion in the same period the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That beat analysts' average estimate of US$1.06 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the firm's fourth consecutive quarterly profit rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said AI servers accounted for more than 40 percent of its server business in the second quarter, saying its next generation AI computing solution had brought "strong growth momentum."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foxconn had previously expected revenue for the second quarter to grow significantly from a year earlier, although revenue from smart computer electronics including smartphones was likely to be flattish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expected its operations to pick up gradually in the second half as many electronics vendors, including Apple, usually release new products ahead of the year-end holiday season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a report prior to the earnings announcement, Taipei-based KGI Securities revised up its sales forecast for Foxconn this year, saying strong demand for new iPhones and AI servers were likely to lead to a better-than-expected outlook for the firm in the second half. (Reuters)

    Tam Tak-chi to appeal sedition conviction in top court

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top court on Wednesday granted jailed former activist Tam Tak-chi a final attempt to appeal against his conviction and sentence for sedition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three presiding judges at the Court of Final Appeal agreed to look into whether offences under now-repealed sedition laws must be tried at the Court of First Instance before a judge and a jury, and if the prosecution has to prove a defendant intended to incite others to commit violence or public disorder in order to secure a conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appeal is set to be heard by Hong Kong's top court on January 10 next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam, a former vice chairman of People Power, had lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his conviction and 40-month prison sentence for his chanting of slogans in the street in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judges at the lower court ruled that the intention to incite violence was not a necessary element for the offence, and that there's nothing suggesting people were subject to "an unacceptably harsh burden" due to the restriction imposed by it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sedition offences stipulated by sections 9 and 10 of the Crimes Ordinance have since been repealed and replaced by provisions in Hong Kong's domestic national security law.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

    Govt probing alleged resale of public hospital drugs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Medicine from a public hospital was allegedly sold via HKTVMall. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766126_1_20240814124922.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched into suspicions that medicine from a public hospital ended up for sale on an e-commerce platform, authorities said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, HKTVMall said it had removed a merchant from its online marketplace after a buyer complained that packaging for an order came with a label indicating the product had originally been given to a patient of Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The product is a laxative which is not classed as a poison and does not require a prescription or for sales to be supervised by a pharmacist, the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, the administration expressed "grave concern over the suspected resale of public hospital patients' medicines" and said the matter will be dealt with seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The DH (Department of Health) is liaising with the Hospital Authority to seriously investigate into the alleged case and shall take prompt enforcement action as appropriate," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this specific case, the DH will investigate along the line of illegal sale of unregistered pharmaceutical products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, So Yiu-wah, president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, suggested that "over-prescribing" of medicines by public hospitals could have played a role in the alleged incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patient rights advocate Tim Pang, from the Society for Community Organisation, said doctors at public hospitals tend to dish out too much medication because of the length of time patients have to wait for their next consultation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang said more community pharmacies would solve this problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because if there are enough community pharmacies for patients to refill the drugs, then the public hospital doctors can prevent from prescribing a lot of drugs to the patients during that waiting period," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten thousand flats will be built near the future Pak Shek Kok MTR Station next to Tolo Harbour and the Science Park, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new East Rail Line station, between Tai Po Market and University, is expected to be completed by 2033.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the Development Bureau said the MTR Corporation is carrying out extensive technical assessments for the station's construction and land development strategies, with a detailed plan for the project to be announced later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Scott Leung said the MTR station and related transport infrastructure should be built before the residential units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's also a member of the Housing Authority, said this approach would ensure efficient and convenient transport for the residents.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources told RTHK the government was working to have two giant pandas arrive in the SAR by late September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two adult pandas, aged between five and eight, are a gift from mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government confirmed that Secretary for Culture, Sports, and Tourism Kevin Yeung would attend a signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement in Sichuan regarding the arrival of the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will head to the province on Thursday morning with representatives from Ocean Park, and will oversee the logistics of transporting the animals to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said Yeung would also be responsible for naming the pandas, adding that September 26 is one of the potential arrival dates for the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Yeung's return to Hong Kong on Friday, Raistlin Lau will serve as acting culture, sports, and tourism chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee had earlier paid a visit to Sichuan, and said the male panda chosen by mainland authorities is agile and smart, while the female panda is gentle and cute.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday said he would not seek re-election as head of his party, meaning the end of his premiership after just under three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since 1945, is due to hold an internal leadership contest next month. Its popularity ratings have slumped because of rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this presidential election, it is necessary to show the people that the LDP is changing and the party is a new LDP," Kishida told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this, transparent and open elections and free and vigorous debate are important. The most obvious first step to show that the LDP will change is for me to step aside," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will not be running in the forthcoming presidential election."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida had informed senior administration officials of his intention not to run, media including national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo news reported earlier,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the ruling party is traditionally also prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida, 67, has been in office since October 2021, and has seen his and his party's poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices hitting Japanese incomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His cabinet's support rating has been languishing around 25 percent this year, according to an NHK poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's fourth-largest economy has also struggled to gain traction, with output shrinking 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen (more than US$100 billion at the time) as he tried to ease the pressure from inflation and rescue his premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having seen prices barely move for years, Japanese voters have been reeling from rising prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, pushing up energy costs and putting pressure on the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some recovery in recent weeks, the yen has been one of the world's worst-performing currencies over the past year, falling sharply against the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While welcome news to Japanese exporters, this makes imports pricier and stokes inflation for households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before November, the government had injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy over the past three years since the pandemic. (AFP)

 Defending champion Demi Vollering won Tuesday's 6.3km time trial through the streets of Rotterdam to take over the lead after three stages of the women's Tour de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fellow Dutchwoman Charlotte Kool made it two wins from two stages on home soil in the morning, before Vollering clocked the fastest time in the second part of a Tuesday double-header to grab the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering powered around the course in 7min 25sec to finish ahead of Olympic time-trial bronze medallist Chloe Dygert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very surprised that I managed to win this time trial. Even with a difference of five seconds. I have no idea how that's possible," said Vollering.

 Kylian Mbappé appears ready to make his debut for Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup against Atalanta on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the France striker arrived in good shape following the European Championship and was adapting well to the team after a week of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé “could play tomorrow,” Ancelotti said Tuesday at a news conference at the National Stadium in Warsaw where the match will be played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé is the biggest draw in the Polish capital after finally joining Madrid following a drawn-out saga with his former club, Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was introduced to the club’s fans at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium last month,  but wasn’t part of the squad on its U.S. tour while he rested after Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He joins a slew of world-class forwards at Madrid, including Vinícius Júnior, another new signing in Brazil striker Endrick, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Arda Guler. (AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn hamstring and will miss the Test series against Sri Lanka, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "England Men's Test Captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the summer after tearing his left hamstring while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred on Sunday," said an ECB statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old all-rounder will be replaced as Test skipper by vice-captain Ollie Pope, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of the scans conducted in Leeds on Tuesday, Stokes will miss England's three-match Test series against Sri Lanka," said the ECB. "The all-rounder is aiming to return for England's winter Test tour of Pakistan, scheduled to start in early October."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first Test against Sri Lanka begins next Wednesday at Old Trafford. (AFP)

    US stocks close higher after positive inflation data

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Tuesday as traders responded positively to cooler-than-expected producer inflation data, bolstering expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.1 percent in July, down slightly from a month earlier, the Labour Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data will likely be well-received by the Federal Reserve as it weighs the right time to begin cutting interest rates from their current 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices on Wall Street finished higher on Wednesday, led by the Nasdaq, which closed up 2.4 percent at 17,187.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished 1.0 percent higher at 39,765, and the S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent to 5,434.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trend in inflation is leading in the right direction, and today was good news," said Tom Cahill, from Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That suggests that the Fed will very likely cut the rates" in September, he added,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual firms, coffee giant Starbucks closed 24.5 percent higher after it named Chipotle chief executive Brian Niccol as its new CEO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the good news for Starbucks was bad news for Chipotle, whose shares closed down 7.5 percent following the news of Niccol's departure. (AFP)

    Banksy lifts curtain on London animal mural series

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The mural outside London Zoo is thought to be the last in the current series. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766068_1_20240814032242.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elusive street artist Banksy's ninth animal-themed mural in nine days, unveiled on Tuesday on a shutter outside London Zoo, depicted a gorilla releasing animals from the zoo, tying together the series of artworks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Claimed by the artist on Instagram, the mural outside London Zoo showed a gorilla lifting the shutter to free birds and a seal, with some animals staring out from the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the latest in Banksy's series populating the British capital with animals, starting with a goat revealed last week on Monday, followed by two elephants the next day and then monkeys, a wolf, pelicans, a cat, piranhas and a rhinoceros in subsequent days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frequency of artworks is unusual for Banksy – whose identity is publicly unknown – and who usually spaces out his pieces over months, leaving fans speculating about the meaning of the different animals and awaiting a "big" reveal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mural was "an absolute shock and surprise to all of us here at London Zoo," Karl Penman, commercial operations manager at the zoo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it is the full stop, what a great full stop to end on," Penman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported the that piece was the last in the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can see the watchful eyes, which to me look a little bit uncertain about whether they want to be free," said doctor Sharmela Darne about the eyes of animals staring from behind the shutter in the latest artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the seal's clearly going away and so are the birds flying free... so maybe it's about freedom and being unsure about freedom," said Darne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For many, the animal safari has added some positivity to their week, as the country reeled following the death of three girls in a stabbing and ensuing violent riots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of two pelicans painted over a fish shop in Walthamstow, northeast London, Peter McCarthy said it had been "very nice to have it in this particular week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Very nice that he's been around the country when there's been such trouble. Doing these wonderful things."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For others, the choice of animals has meaning, with some finding the goat similar to a Palestinian mountain gazelle and others pointing out the artist's previous work on the climate crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the artworks have already been removed or stolen, and the rhino revealed on Monday was defaced the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A satellite dish painted with the wolf was stolen within hours of being claimed by Banksy, with the cat on a billboard removed by contractors and a police box painted with swimming piranhas removed by the local authority to ensure it was "properly protected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of the cat on Saturday before it was removed, dentist Mitul Patel said he wished "people would leave his work alone so that other people could enjoy it as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locals and tourists alike have been enjoying the artworks that are still up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking a brief pause from his job, construction worker Owen said the three monkeys in east London's Shoreditch area were "very exciting" and a "big talking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Mazur, a photographer visiting from the US, said he had been "running around photographing all" the artworks, and was "bummed" about having to return to New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retiree Don Gould lives around the corner from the goat in southwest London's Kew Green, and saw the artwork after it was revealed online last week. "It's a very good excuse for a stroll on the green and a pint, isn't it?" (AFP)

    US car workers union files charges against Trump, Musk

    <![CDATA[<img alt="During their live-streamed conversation on X, Donald Trump heaped praise on Elon Musk for his history of firing employees at the drop of a hat. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766067_1_20240814025737.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A major US car workers union filed federal labour charges on Tuesday against Donald Trump and Elon Musk, accusing the billionaires of illegally intimidating workers during a rambling and highly publicised conversation on X.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential hopeful and Musk, who has endorsed him, exchanged a checklist of radical conspiracy theories as they chatted on the social network on Monday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one point the conversation veered into Musk's time at the helm of his multiple companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I mean, I look at what you do," Trump said to Musk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You walk in, you say, 'You want to quit?' They go on strike," Trump said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That's OK, you're all gone. You're all gone. So, every one of you is gone.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk carried out massive layoffs after his acquisition of Twitter (now X) was finalised in October 2022, and he announced in April the dismissal of more than 10 percent of Tesla's global workforce, amounting to at least 14,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labour Relations Act," said the United Auto Workers (UAW), which has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris after previously backing Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean. When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean," said UAW President Shawn Fain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Trump and Musk want working class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly," Fain said. "It's disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk owns the social network X, SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, among other companies. He has been criticised in the past for obstructing the unionisation of his employees around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla has been at odds with unions in Sweden and Norway for a few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several complaints have also been filed in California by former SpaceX workers who say employees who tried to protest job conditions were retaliated against. (AFP)

    Israeli far-right minister prays at disputed mosque

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from several Muslim countries, as well as the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766064_1_20240814022139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A far-right Israeli minister prayed with thousands of Jews at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem on Tuesday, defying a ban on Jewish prayer at the flashpoint site and drawing global condemnation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to "defeat Hamas" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The compound is Islam's third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity, but it is also Judaism's holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israel-Hamas war, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for threatened attacks from Iran and its proxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not only is it unacceptable, it detracts from what we think is a vital time, as we are working to get this ceasefire deal across the finish line," US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years, the restrictions have been increasingly flouted by hardline religious nationalists like Ben Gvir, prompting sometimes violent reactions from Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, he and some 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns, under the protection of Israeli police, said an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is custodian of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli police also "imposed restrictions" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said, adding that more than 700 Jews also prayed there in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque, is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa Mosque," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the "storming" of the mosque, calling it a "flagrant violation of international law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continual violations of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities require a clear and firm international position that condemns these violations," ministry spokesperson Sufyan al-Qudah said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group of Muslim-majority states, "strongly condemned" the incident and said it was a "provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was "against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This sort of behaviour is unhelpful and it is unduly provocative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on X that the bloc "strongly condemns the provocations" by Ben Gvir.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted on social media networks showed Ben Gvir inside the compound while several Israelis lay on the ground performing Talmudic rituals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir released a video statement on X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, renewing his opposition to any truce in the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo," he said, referring to the US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza set to resume on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can defeat Hamas... we must bring them down to their knees," Ben Gvir said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's entry into the Al-Aqsa compound comes on the Jewish mourning day of Tisha Be'Av that commemorates the destruction of the ancient temple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month too, Ben Gvir, who is known for provocative gestures, said he had prayed inside the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man appeared in a London court on Tuesday charged with attempted murder after an 11-year-old girl was stabbed in one of the capital's busiest tourist areas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ioan Pintaru, 32, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court, which heard that he was a Romanian citizen with no fixed address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The girl was with her mother when she was attacked in Leicester Square on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said Pintaru had "approached the girl, placed her into a headlock, he's then stabbed her eight times to the body."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was taken to hospital with serious but not life threatening injuries. She was wounded in the face, shoulder, wrist and neck area, the prosecutor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said they do not believe that the suspect knew the girl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pintaru was remanded in custody to appear in court again on September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack outside top brand stores in the central London square came two weeks after a mass stabbing in Southport, northwest England, in which three girls were killed and eight children and two adults wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack sparked riots across England, after rumours spread online that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England batsman Graham Thorpe died after being struck by a train at a railway station, an inquest into his death heard on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 55-year-old took his own life, his wife Amanda revealed on Monday in an interview with The Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe died on the morning of August 4 having suffered "traumatic injuries" during the incident at Esher railway station, southwest of London, Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area coroner for Surrey, Simon Wickens, recorded Thorpe's cause of death as one of multiple injuries during the short hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner offered his "sincere condolences" not just to Thorpe's family, but to "all those touched by his life and career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A date for the full inquest will be fixed at a later time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's death plunged the cricket world into mourning for the popular star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoyed an impressive England career as an elegant batsman from 1993 to 2005, before spending 12 years in various coaching roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Thorpe was hospitalised in May 2022 and declared "seriously ill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe told The Times that the former Surrey batsman attempted suicide two years ago before taking his own life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite having a wife and two daughters whom he loved and who loved him, he did not get better. He was so unwell in recent times and he really did believe that we would be better off without him and we are devastated that he acted on that and took his own life," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe added: "Graham was renowned as someone who was very mentally strong on the field and he was in good physical health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But mental illness is a real disease and can affect anyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's daughter Kitty, 22, said the family "are not ashamed" of talking about his death, adding: "There is nothing to hide and it is not a stigma."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-hander featured in 100 Test matches and 82 one-day internationals for England, scoring over 9,000 runs for his country, including 16 Test hundreds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in India on Tuesday said hospital services were disrupted in several Indian cities after a doctors' protest spread nationwide following the rape and murder of a trainee medic in the city of Kolkata.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of doctors marched on Monday in Kolkata and the surrounding West Bengal state to denounce the killing at a government-run hospital, demanding justice for the victim and better security measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old doctor was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests spread on Tuesday, with more than 8,000 government doctors in the western Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, halting work in all hospital departments except emergency services, media said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the capital, New Delhi, junior doctors wearing white coats held posters that read, "Doctors are not punching bags," as they sat in protest outside a large government hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar protests in cities such as Lucknow, capital of the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, and in the western tourist resort state of Goa hit some hospital services, media said. (Reuters)

    Africa health body warns over mpox spread

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The African Union's health watchdog on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over the growing mpox outbreak on the continent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766050_1_20240813221254.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Africa's top public health body declared what it termed a "public health emergency of continental security" on Tuesday over an outbreak of mpox that spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I declare with a heavy heart but with an unyielding commitment to our people, to our African citizens, we declare mpox as public health emergency of continental security," Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said during an online media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox is transmitted through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. Most cases are mild but it can kill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as Clade I.
  <br/>
  But the new variant, known as Clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, particularly among children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Africa CDC warned last week the viral infection's rate of spread was alarming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that more than 15,000 mpox cases and 461 deaths were reported on the continent this year so far, representing a 160 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades after it was first detected in human in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A milder version of the virus spread to over 100 countries in 2022, largely through sexual contact, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO ended the emergency 10 months later, saying the health crisis had come under control. (Reuters)

    New data indicates easing US inflation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures are further cooling. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766045_1_20240813212653.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures were cooling further as the Federal Reserve moves closer to cutting interest rates, likely beginning next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that its producer price index — which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers — rose 0.1 percent from June to July and 2.2 percent from a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices were unchanged from June and up 2.4 percent from July 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases were milder than forecasters had expected and were nearly consistent with the Fed's two percent inflation target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index can provide an early sign of where consumer inflation is headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Labor Department will release the most well-known inflation measure, the consumer price index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters have estimated that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent from June to July, after actually falling 0.1 percent the previous month, and three percent from July 2023, according to a survey by the data firm FactSet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation has plummeted since peaking at a four-decade high in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as Americans prepare to vote in the November presidential election, many remain unhappy with consumer prices, which are nearly 19 percent higher than were before the inflationary surge began in the spring of 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have assigned blame to US President Joe Biden, though it's unclear whether they will hold Vice President Kamala Harris responsible as she seeks the presidency. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Insurers may not pay out if trips to Japan are cancelled or cut short in the event that a feared "megaquake" in the country actually materialises, an industry representative said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On August 8, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern island of Kyushu, prompting Japanese authorities to issue their first-ever warning of an increased risk of a major quake in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers has urged travellers to carefully study the fine print of their policies, adding that they may not cover disruption linked to a "known risk" such as any further quake connected to the one of last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [insurance] scheme was purchased after the initial earthquake on August 8, then people may not receive compensation if their trip was cancelled or cut short," said the federation's chief executive, Selina Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Hong Kong airport, a man surnamed Lo and his family were checking in for their flight to Tokyo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said they decided to go ahead with the 10-day trip after confirming their travel insurance was still valid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We planned the trip for a very long time. I don't want to disappoint my kids and family. It is a bit risky, but we still want to go," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Yip said she had "no choice" but to go ahead with her trip to Osaka as she did not want to lose the money she paid for the flights and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I booked the trip around five months ago and I could not apply for a refund now," she said, adding that her insurer had reassured her that the trip would still be covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have checked the consulate's phone numbers and if anything happens, I will deal with it when it comes," she said.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Myanmar and Thailand from August 14 to 17.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wang's trip to Myanmar is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in various fields and fostering closer bonds between the two peoples.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also said China supports Myanmar's effort to maintain stability and develop its economy.

    'High interest rates weigh on SMEs confidence'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Senior Standard Chartered economist Kelvin Lau (right) says lingering global uncertainties have affected SME business confidence. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766023_1_20240813172255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Productivity Council on Tuesday warned that a high interest rate environment is putting pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with business confidence among SMEs dropping to the lowest point in two years
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a quarterly survey conducted by the council in July, 56 percent of the 814 local businesses interviewed said high interest rates had affected consumer spending, with the most affected industries being retail, accommodation and food services and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, about one-third of the SMEs interviewed said they had a cash flow or supply chain problem because of the high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said business sentiment among SMEs remained cautious, with the latest Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index recording a decline in confidence to 42.5 points, dropping from 47.3 in the previous quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief innovation officer Lawrence Cheung said 10 of the 11 industries involved in the survey had shown a drop in confidence, with real estate having the lowest score. He said that indicated both external and domestic-oriented sectors were under-performing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Standard Chartered senior economist Kelvin Lau said the survey indicated a lack of confidence among SMEs over the global economic outlook due to external uncertainties lingering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Number one is the possibility of [Donald] Trump coming into office after the US elections in November. And the other being China's recent macro data weakness following its slightly weaker than expected Q2 GDP [growth], which came in at 4.7 percent rather than anything closer to 5 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So overall, it's kind of like a double whammy that the local businesses need to worry about the US and they need to worry about China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he added there are certain bright spots, citing expectations the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates from September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our own view is that we could see a collective 75 basis points of cuts between now and the year-end and possibly even more cuts in the first half of next year, to as much as 125 basis points in total,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So that would hopefully be a lot of relief to the Hong Kong SMEs, in particular the real estate sector, for example, and to some extent the accommodation and food services sector as well.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on low-incomes in Hong Kong are struggling to afford nutritious food and some are having to skip meals altogether due to rising prices, an NGO said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Food Grace said it carried out a survey involving more than 500 underprivileged people in Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po, finding that a third had cut back on the number of meals they ate due to financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of the respondents said that to save money, they either opted for less healthy food or went hungry on occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO described the situation as worrying and urged the government to provide food subsidies to those in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Angela Lo, project manager with the group, said better education on healthy eating would benefit many people who need to cook on a limited budget.
