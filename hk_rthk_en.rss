<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR says it will deploy an extra 1,000 members of staff on Sunday when a partial shutdown of the Kwun Tong Line takes place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin will be suspended for the day due to a full maintenance operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maintenance will replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations will still be served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Train frequencies will be changed to accommodate citizens' needs, with Kwun Tong Line waiting times lengthened to five minutes to avoid overcrowding at Prince Edward Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsuen Wan Line trains will be available every 3.5 minutes, while Tuen Ma Line trains will arrive every 5.5 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail operator suggested passengers plan their journeys ahead and make use of alternative railway routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prince Edward Station will be very busy on that day because it will be the only interchange station between Kwun Tong Line and Tsuen Wan Line stations on this coming Sunday. We will provide extra hands, extra staff in the affected stations to help all passengers, [and] we will provide service counters at Prince Edward Station, Whampoa, Ho Man Tin and Yau Ma Tei during peak hours this weekdays and also on the coming Saturday and Sunday for whole day," said Cheris Lee, who heads the MTR's operating and metro segment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowd management measures will be in place at Prince Edward Station from Sunday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, free bus services will run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin, and Whampoa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bus route No.8 that runs from Kowloon Station to Tsim Sha Tsui Pier will be available for free to passengers for the whole journey, while passengers taking route No.30X that runs from Whampoa Gardens to Tsuen Wan Allway Gardens will not need to pay if they board at designated bus stops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both route frequencies will be increased to every 10 minutes, and staff will be present at different bus stops to assist citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there will be different checkpoints along the tunnel, and the company will continuously update the maintenance progress on Sunday so citizens will be informed about traffic conditions on Monday, July 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MTR said they are confident that the maintenance would be completed within 28 hours and citizens would be able to use train services as usual the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR expects the Tung Chung Line to be the next to undergo maintenance that will affect train services.

    Hamas, Fatah sign landmark declaration in Beijing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi, centre, and members of various Palestinian factions attend the signing of the Beijing Declaration aimed at ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Tuesday announced it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an "interim national reconciliation government" to govern post-war Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it," Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian factions met with the media, with Wang present, CGTN said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among the factions held in Beijing from July 21-23, CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's attack on southern Israel last October, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to "reconciliation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza," Wang said following the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the factions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community," Wang said. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of an SAR delegation which will visit Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos along with Chief Executive John Lee later this month says Hong Kong can play a key role in financing projects in the Southeast Asian countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo Kam-wing, president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, said Hong Kong's professional services have global recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our accounting, financial, taxation, legal, our ESG [environmental, social, and governance] and construction can provide a high quality support for infrastructure development in these countries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can play a key role as an infrastructure financial hub and provide these countries with diversifying financing channels, including equity listing and also syndicate loans, private equity funds, ordinary bonds, etc."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jonathan Choi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said it is significant that Lee will lead the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because as an individual company, we have been there for a long time, nothing special, we do it every day. But this time the CE is coming, then it is different. It shows that the whole Hong Kong or the business community is going to work together with these three countries."

    Let young entrepreneurs use abandoned schools: BPA

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762785_1_20240723134912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) on Tuesday said the government should let young entrepreneurs operate from abandoned schools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proposal is among the party's suggestions for Chief Executive John Lee's next policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Central Government Offices in Admiralty, BPA chairman Lo Wai-kwok said many schools have shut down recently and the government should make good use of the campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Encouraging the entrepreneurship among our younger generation...one of the concerns is they need offices. They need some space for them to do their research," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since we have some facilities available in the community, so how to make better use of these facilities, of course, is an obvious thing that the government should consider and the government should do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, called on the government to drop duty on spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The loss of income on duties will be offset by the increase in economic activities many, many times. And we are confident that with this reduction of duty to zero, it would help to cheer up - we talk about spirit - the spirit of Hong Kong, the spirit of our citizens," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BPA also suggested the CE loosen the requirements of the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme by allowing applicants to include the purchase of residential property.

    'Surge in illegal cigarette ads alarming'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="District leaders concerned total bans on cigarettes will exacerbate illegal advertisement problem. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762787_1_20240723135954.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 District councillors on Tuesday expressed concern over a surge in illegal cigarette advertisements, with bus stops, trash cans, and shopping mall restrooms becoming hotspots for these illicit promotions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proliferation of these advertisements has prompted calls for stricter enforcement to prevent further distribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office must take decisive measures to comprehensively crack down on these activities,” said Sha Tin District Councillor Leung Ka-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government recently proposed 10 short-term tobacco control measures, but another Sha Tin District Councillor, Eddie Lam, cautioned against implementing tobacco restrictions all at once, citing that rash measures could stimulate the black market, pushing more smokers towards illicit cigarettes, and exacerbating the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think that the government should implement policies in phases, it might be more effective instead of the 10 short-term policies at the same time,” said Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested looking at other overseas practices for reference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments that have implemented flavoured cigarette controls have adopted phased implementation, such as the EU and Canada, which first banned fruit-flavoured cigarettes rather than implementing a blanket ban. The authorities should take this as a reference."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they have arrested five men on suspicion of selling fake concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Chan Hoi-leung said three people filed a report after paying between HK$1,500 and HK$3,300 for fake tickets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police received reports that some people bought tickets online or outside concert venues, using cash or money transfer. When they attempted to enter concert venues, organisers told them that their tickets were... fake," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the fake tickets were convincing and included security features such as QR codes and hologram stickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police urged the public to avoid purchasing tickets from unofficial channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 34 and 46, were arrested on suspicion of obtaining property by deception and were being detained for further investigation.

    Harris has growing support of DNC delegates: polls

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762759_1_20240723104050.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris has received the support of enough Democratic delegates to win her party's presidential nomination, CNN and other US media reported late on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Harris will need the support of at least 1,976 pledged delegates out of nearly 4,000 in order to decisively secure the Democratic presidential nomination during an official vote in the coming weeks, a number which US outlets reported she has now surpassed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the Democratic Party plans to push forward with a virtual roll call in which delegates to its convention can choose a presidential nominee before they gather next month in Chicago — despite Harris being overwhelmingly favoured to replace US President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention rules committee will meet Wednesday to approve how the virtual roll call will work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It does not list a date for when virtual voting would begin, but Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the process will be completed by August 7 — or 12 days before the party's convention begins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are living through an unprecedented moment in history and, as a party, we are tackling it with the seriousness that it deserves,” Harrison said on a conference call with reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are prepared to undertake a transparent, swift and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a nominee who represents our values.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Democrats "can, and will, be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden dropped out of the presidential race on Sunday, ending weeks of fighting among Democrats, many of whom feared he was not up to the rigours the campaign — much less a second term — following his poor debate against Repulican nominee Donald Trump last month. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning Olympic silver medalist Marketa Vondrousova withdrew from the Paris Summer Games on Monday due to a hand injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2023 Wimbledon champion from the Czech Republic lost to Switerland's Belinda Bencic in the gold medal match at the Tokyo Olympics in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova had been planning to play singles as well as doubles with Karolina Muchova. The tennis competition at Roland Garros begins on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was hoping until the last moment that I could go at least in doubles, but problems with my hand won't let me on the court," Vondrousova posted on Instagram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kateřina Siniaková, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in doubles and is a nine-time Grand Slam champion in women's doubles, will replace Vondrousova in the women's singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova, 25, said her focus now shifts to getting healthy in time for next month's U.S. Open, the final grand slam on the 2024 calendar. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's three benchmarks ended higher on Monday as investors returned to megacap growth stocks, helping both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recover from their worst weekly performance since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also back in positive territory, breaking a two-session skid since hitting an all-time closing high last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacaps Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Tesla all advanced between 2.2 percent and 5.1 percent after being major drags on the market last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia also rose 4.8 percent% after Reuters reported the artificial intelligence chip leader was working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compliant with current US export controls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think this move today probably has more to do with a rebound from the selling that occurred last week than anything else," said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy & research at Glenmede.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief among the other factors on traders' minds was a re-examination of the state of the presidential race after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy for the November election on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's exit could prompt investors to unwind trades on bets that a victory for Republican Trump would increase US fiscal and inflationary pressures. But some analysts said markets could benefit from an increased chance of a divided government under the next administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump-linked stocks were mixed on Monday, with Trump Media & Technology Group dropping 0.8 percent, while software firm Phunware gained 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having digested the news of Biden's withdrawal, investors will now be looking for answers to key questions including who will join Harris on the Democratic presidential ticket and to what degree, if any, the vice president will deviate from the platform which Biden was headlining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.08 percent, at 5,564 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.58 percent, to 18,008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 40,415.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike slumped 13.5 percent, extending losses after a software update from the company sparked Friday's global tech outage. (Reuters)

 Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar has been ruled out of the Paris 2024 Olympics, the Slovenian Olympic Committee said on Monday.

  <br/>
  Pogacar, who won his third Tour on Sunday, was not selected because of fatigue, the Slovenian Olympic Committee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar was due to take part in the road race on August 3.

  "Unfortunately Tadej Pogacar has cancelled his participation because of a state of extreme fatigue," Slovenian Olympic cycling coach Uros Murn said in a statement.

 A gunman entered a nursing home in northwestern Croatia on Monday shooting dead five people, including his mother, and injuring six others, a government minister said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One of the wounded later died in hospital taking the death toll to six, while four remain in critical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the victims was a nursing home employee, according to Marin Piletic, minister for labour, pension, family and social policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information we have the mother of the killer had been in the nursing home for 10 years," Piletic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have given no motive for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatian media reported that the gunman, born in 1973, is a war veteran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are shocked," Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told reporters in Split.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is really a monstrous act of the murder of a group of people, of the mother and other very old people who happened to be there.... We condemn this crime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killer fled the scene, but was later arrested by the police, N1 news portal reported. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris lauded President Joe Biden for his service to the country in her first public appearance on Monday since he abruptly abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed her as his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Joe Biden's legacy over the last three years is unmatched in modern history," Harris said at a White House event to honour college athletes. "Every day, our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris did not specifically refer to her new status as the leading Democratic candidate for president, after Biden stepped aside on Sunday under growing pressure from fellow Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campaign officials and allies have already made hundreds of calls on Harris' behalf, urging delegates to next month's Democratic Party convention to join in nominating her for president in the November 5 election against Republican Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's departure was the latest shock to a White House race that included the near-assassination of former President Trump by a gunman during a campaign stop and the nomination of Trump's fellow hardliner, US Senator J.D. Vance, as his running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris said in a post on X that she would visit what had been the Biden campaign headquarters in Delaware – now the Harris campaign headquarters – on Monday afternoon. She said Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 last week, was feeling better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Virtually all of the prominent Democrats who had been seen as potential challengers to Harris have lined up behind her, including Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky. (Reuters)

    US Secret Service 'failed' over Trump shooting: chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle admitted to Congress on Monday that she and her agency failed when a would-be assassin wounded Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We failed," Cheatle, who faces Republican calls for her removal, said in testimony before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. "The assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13th is the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the face of Republican claims that the Secret Service denied resources to protect Trump, she said security for the former president had grown ahead of the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The level of security provided for the former president increased well before the campaign and has been steadily increasing as threats evolve," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the Secret Service provided the security sought by the Trump campaign for the rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I can tell you is that for the event on July 13, the details that were requested, the assets that were requested for that day, were given," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She declined to answer specific questions about the day's security plan from Republicans and Democrats, saying the matter was being investigated internally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's hearing marked the first round of congressional oversight of the attempted assassination. On Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray will appear before the House Judiciary Committee. And House Speaker Mike Johnson is also due to unveil a bipartisan task force to serve as a nexus point for House investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle has resisted calls for her resignation from top Republicans including Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Republican House Oversight Committee James Comer echoed those calls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is my firm belief, Director Cheatle, that you should resign," the Kentucky Republican told her. "The Secret Service has thousands of employees and a significant budget. But it has now become the face of incompetence." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong police officer has died while on holiday in the eastern Thai resort town of Pattaya after he was thrown off a small passenger truck on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department confirmed that it had received a request for help from the man's family, and pledged to render all possible assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to local media, the 48-year-old Chinese tourist, surnamed Lam, was found injured in the middle of the road after he was thrown off a songthaew, a popular form of public transport in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photos circulating online showed locals giving first aid to the man, who was eventually pronounced dead in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vehicle left the scene, and police have since located the driver who said he was not aware of the accident, according to media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police later confirmed that the man was a serving officer. The force expressed its deepest condolences and said it would keep in touch with the family to provide all appropriate assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing champion Edgar Cheung and double swimming silver medallist Siobhan Haughey have been named as the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China team at the Olympic opening ceremony later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR Athletes will join thousands of other competitors in a unique ceremony taking place on the River Seine in Paris, and winding past some of the most famous landmarks in the French capital on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of their departure to Paris, the Chef de Mission of the SAR delegation, Brian Stevenson, called on Hongkongers to back the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look to the athletes to perform their best, and of course the best for each athlete differs, but I'm talking about their personal best. If they can achieve that, you cannot ask for more than that, other than that bit better than even their best," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll be satisfied if all the athletes have given their very best performance and we know their records and what they can achieve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who was the city's flag bearer at the Tokyo Olympics, becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to be picked for the honour in successive Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stevenson also confirmed air-conditioners will arrive at the Olympic village on Tuesday, admitting the units were arriving later than scheduled because of security reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is one of a number of delegations that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.

 LeBron James, the NBA's all-time leading points scorer, will be the male flagbearer for Team USA at the Paris Olympics, US Olympic officials announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  James, 39, was picked by his fellow US Olympians for Friday's ceremony on the River Seine. The female flagbearer will be announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an incredible honour to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together," Los Angeles Lakers power forward James said in a statement from the USOPC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I'm proud to be a part of this important moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony on the Seine will be the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James, an Olympic gold medallist in 2008 and 2012, is not the only NBA star set to bear the flag for his country in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player and league champion in 2021, will perform the role for Greece. (AFP)

 Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will visit China this week for talks on the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday that Kuleba will visit China from Tuesday to Friday at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.

  <br/>
  "The main topic of discussion will be the search for ways to stop Russian aggression and China's possible role in achieving a sustainable and just peace," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in its statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, President Xi Jinping called on the international community to help Ukraine and Russia resume dialogue in a bid to resolve their conflict when he met with visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Beijing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Economists are anticipating more interest rate cuts by the mainland’s central bank this year, after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced the reduction of two benchmark rates on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The PBOC lowered the one-year loan prime rate from 3.45 percent to 3.35 percent, and the five-year rate from 3.95 percent to 3.85 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Greater China Economist at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Michelle Lam said the rate cuts came earlier than expected, but she predicts the trims to have a limited impact on the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think that a 10 basis point cut will be a game changer. And also right now, there's a lot of weak confidence among households. So probably it will not be very impactful in terms of boosting household consumption," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But still, it's better than not doing anything. So there will still be maybe somewhat marginally positive [impact] to support the domestic demand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate cuts came after the mainland saw slower-than-forecast economic growth of 4.7 percent in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Chan, a Greater China Economist at Standard Chartered, said he believes the rate reductions will provide some support to the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cutting is to strengthen the countercyclical adjustment and to support the real economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we suggest the economy needs more supporting measures. And I guess the central bank also acted on that, to provide enough support to the real economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said he expects there will be at least one 10 basis point rate cut in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC on Monday also lowered the interest rates on its standing lending facility, a type of loans that it lends to commercial banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The overnight, seven-day and one-month rates were cut by 10 basis points to 2.55 percent, 2.7 percent and 3.05 percent respectively.

    DAB finds more than 90 flooding blackspots in city

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB says the government should monitor flooding blackspots more carefully. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762661_1_20240722160025.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday said it had found at least 91 flooding blackspots during its survey of the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said it conducted a thorough investigation of potential flooding blackspots from May to June this year, at the height of Hong Kong's rainy season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the flooding blackspots found, eight were on Hong Kong Island, 45 were in Kowloon and 38 were in the New Territories and on the outlying islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stanley Li, a DAB member, said they found the current drainage system insufficient, which causes problems such as clogged drains or flooding in malls and housing estates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party urged the government to have more updated information on flooding blackspots, impose stricter flood drainage standards, and more closely monitor the responsibilities of managers at private premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said there should be a better flood warning system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let me raise an example. If anyone here has a mainland phone number, actually in mainland whenever an extreme weather event happened, the local meteorological bureau will immediately send messages to the phone number's owner, so that citizens can prepare ahead of time, like implementing flood prevention measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global warming has resulted in an increased frequency of rainstorms, including more extreme ones, that are becoming more unpredictable and causing more severe cases of flooding.

 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) on Monday announced the establishment of the city’s first Department of Art and Machine Creativity, aiming to integrate tech and art to create a hub which cultivates talent in the creative industries and drives the development of art technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department is working on several research projects that experiment with the use of AI in the comprehension and creation of music, film, and visual art such as programming speaking voices to sing different songs in different languages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do believe that machine creativity, just like machine learning now, will be the phenomenon of the future," said HKUST Professor Guo Yike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The postgraduate courses on offer, beginning September 2025, will allow students to leverage technologies such as AI and machine learning in artistic creation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department has partnered with more than a dozen industry leaders and academic institutions, including Huawei, Sony Entertainment, and Bard College to strengthen curriculum development and collaborate on research in machine creativity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work globally. You can foresee our students will have an education not just in Hong Kong, but treat Hong Kong as a hub for East-west culture exchange," said Guo.

    Liu Ma Kee admits buying mainland fermented bean curd

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The fourth-generation owner of Liu Ma Kee said the century-old fermented bean curb brand has been importing from the mainland for three decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Jay Liu said the company was unable to manufacture the raw product because it couldn't meet sewage regulations here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he emphasised that the items were processed locally, including seasoning and packaging, before they were put on sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Liu Ma Kee product was earlier found by the Centre for Food Safety to contain excessive levels of Bacillus cereus, sparking a war of words between the family running the business and health authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu on Monday apologised to the Centre for Food Safety, saying his family members had overreacted in their comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company closed down last week, and Liu said it's unlikely to reopen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our decision to shut down the store has nothing to do with the incident. We had already been facing a lot of pressure to close down earlier due to the city's worsening economic situation, as well as the change in weather that poses a challenge to the preservation of fermented bean curd."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to inquiries from RTHK, Customs confirmed they are following up complaints against Liu Ma Kee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said officers will take appropriate action if they discover a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

    Three jailed in landmark market manipulation trial

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been jailed for up to six years and eight months after being convicted in a high-profile market manipulation case, with a High Court judge saying the trio had damaged the city's status as a financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sit Yi-ki, Lam Wing-ki and Tam Cheuk-hang were found guilty of conspiracy to carry out false trading in the shares of Hong Kong-listed construction services company Ching Lee Holdings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence on Monday, deputy High Court judge Douglas Yau said it was a "meticulously planned and executed conspiracy" which threatened the integrity of the market, and therefore sentences serving as a deterrent were needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission, which brought the case, said the conspirators artificially increased the turnover of the shares by conducting manipulative trading activities among 156 securities accounts in 2016, while netting illicit profits of more than HK$124 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ploy began before Ching Lee's listing on March 29, 2016 and lasted for more than five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The manipulative activities inflated Ching Lee's share price by as much as 2,000 percent and it reached a historic high of HK$5.98 on July 13. It closed at HK$4.87 on September 6, before a collapse of 90 percent the following day to HK$0.45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission's executive director of enforcement, Christopher Wilson, said the sentences are the longest ever handed down by a court for a market manipulation offence under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It sends a very strong and clear message that we will not tolerate any continuous and further misdoings. This is also the first time that one of our cases has been heard before the High Court before a jury," he told reporters after the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined to root out all forms of market manipulation, to protect investors and uphold the integrity of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other people alleged to have been involved in the case are currently wanted by the authorities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 In a world filled with misinformation and disinformation, seeing something may not be enough to make you believe it is true.
 <br>
  <br/>
  And with images that blur the line between reality and fantasy becoming more mainstream in everyday life, some people say they have become much more careful with how they consume what they see around them, especially on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To see just how sceptical people have become, our reporter Elvis Yu conducted an experiment. He asked members of the public to comment on a photo that had once sparked intense debate because it looked too spectacular to be true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also spoke to experts and an investigative journalist to see what could be done to regain people's trust.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Standby Signal No. 1 was cancelled at 12.20pm on Monday as Tropical Storm Prapiroon no longer posed a threat to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the Observatory said the rainbands associated with the storm are still affecting the coast of Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At noon, Prapiroon was about 610 kilometres west-southwest of Hong Kong, and was forecast to move northwest at about 10 kilometres per hour crossing Beibu Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm earlier made landfall on Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The No. 1 signal, who was issued on Saturday evening, had been in effect for more than 37 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the weather on Monday will be mainly cloudy with a few squally showers and thunderstorms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will become very hot with sunny periods in the next couple of days, with temperatures reaching 35 degrees Celsius or higher over the New Territories.

 Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth will be the first Hong Kong sailors racing in Olympic 49er competitions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 49er is a two-handed skiff-type high-performance sailing dinghy, which requires the two crew members to work on different roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo told RTHK about their strong bond, which started in 2018 when they paired up.

 The Hong Kong market opened higher on Monday amid an announcement by the mainland central bank to cut two key lending rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 47 points or 0.27 percent at 17,465.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland stocks were mixed on Monday, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index down 0.14 percent to open at 2,978.19 points and the Shenzhen Component Index 0.06 percent higher at 8,908.21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the People's Bank of China announced it was cutting two key rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.35 percent from 3.45 percent previously, while the five-year LPR was reduced by the same margin to 3.85 percent from 3.95 percent .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 China cut benchmark lending rates at a monthly fixing on Monday, after the central bank surprised the markets by lowering a key short-term policy rate earlier in the session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.35 percent from 3.45 percent previously, while the five-year LPR was reduced by the same margin to 3.85 percent from 3.95 percent .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Arthur Fils came out on top after a gruelling three-set encounter with Alexander Zverev to win the Hamburg Open on Sunday, defeating the hometown player 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/1).
 <br>
  <br/>
  After victory in Lyon last year, it is the 20-year-old's second ATP title as he confirms his position as one of the sport's leading next-gen players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 28 Fils overcame German top seed Zverev on the clay in Hamburg after just over three-and-a-half hours on court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew from the start it was not going to be easy. First set I was taking care of it, I think I had a little but of luck, but playing great. Then second set he managed to play better than me and to raise his level," said Fils during the trophy ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we closed the roof I knew it was going to be just a fight, like a dogfight. You just have to fight until the last point, until the last ball. I've practising for a long time for this kind of moment so I'm really happy to win it." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele said a "sense of calm" helped him win the British Open on Sunday as the American claimed his second major just two months after triumphing at the PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old Californian delivered a faultless, zen-like six-under-par final round at Royal Troon to emerge from a congested leaderboard and clinch the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele finished on nine-under par for the championship, two shots ahead of England's Justin Rose and Billy Horschel of the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele, who registered a major record of 21-under-par to win the PGA at Valhalla in May, is the first player to win two majors in a year since Brooks Koepka in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His victory on the west coast of Scotland completes an American clean sweep of the game's biggest titles in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought (winning the PGA) would help me and it actually did. I had this sense of calm, a calm I didn't have when I played earlier at the PGA," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was telling my caddie Austin (Kaiser) that I felt pretty calm coming down the stretch and he said he was about to puke on the 18th tee."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just told myself to just hit it down there and keep moving along," added the world number three, who described clinching the Open as a "dream come true". (AFP)

    Republicans say Biden should go immediately

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than a dozen Republicans called on US President Joe Biden to step down on Sunday after he ended his re-election bid, saying that his unwillingness to continue to campaign raises questions about his ability to continue to govern.
 <br>
  <br/>
  House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, US Senator JD Vance – the just-nominated running mate of Donald Trump in the November 5 election – and other lawmakers urged the 81-year-old incumbent to step down from office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden insisted in his statement that he would finish his term, which ends January 20, 2025, and fellow Democrats blasted the calls as "ridiculous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough," said Johnson, who is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's fellow Democrats for weeks had called on him to end his campaign after a disastrous June 27 debate against former President Trump in which Biden at times struggled to finish his thoughts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?" Vance tweeted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, including Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin, called on Biden's Cabinet to remove him from office by invoking the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution. Biden's Cabinet, composed of officials hand-picked by the president, is highly unlikely to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the resignation calls, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close associate of Biden, said, "I think that is ridiculous." (Reuters)

    Democrats rally behind VP Harris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kamala Harris hopes to make history as the first Black woman to be US president. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762584_1_20240722052554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many Democrats on Sunday quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After weeks of in-party fighting between Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind her is crucial just over 100 days before November's election. However, there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, not in his initial letter stepping down, but in a separate statement. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, lawmakers including US Senator Patty Murray, and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said on social media platform X. "Democrats – it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris "the American dream personified," noting she was the daughter of immigrants. "She is also toughness personified, rising from my hometown of Oakland, California, to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, others including Pelosi thanked Biden for his patriotism but did not yet throw their support behind Harris or any other candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Senator Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an open process to nominate Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats should have “an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party,” he said. “The debate in the Democratic Party is who can carry on the legacy of President Biden and defeat Trump.” (Reuters)

    Biden quits re-election bid, backs VP Harris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Donald Trump while endorsing Vice President Kamal Harris to replace him as the party's candidate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, in a post on X, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His initial statement had not included an endorsement of Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with an expression of support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major-party ticket in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party's nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's announcement follows a wave of public and private pressure from Democratic lawmakers and party officials to quit the race after his shockingly poor performance in a June 27 televised debate last month against Republican rival Trump, 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump's performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden's fitness for another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party's nomination for reelection since President Lyndon Johnson in March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Harris emerges as the nominee, the move would represent an unprecedented gamble by the Democratic Party: its first Black and Asian American woman to run for the White House in a country that has elected one Black president and never a woman president in more than two centuries of democracy.

    Team orders hand Piastri maiden F1 victory in Hungary

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Oscar Piastri takes the chequered flag in Hungary. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762573_1_20240722011022.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri said he realised a childhood dream on Sunday after claiming his maiden Formula One victory in a whirlpool of mixed emotions and vexed team orders as McLaren claimed an emphatic one-two at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After taking the lead at the start, when he passed pole-sitting team-mate Lando Norris, the 23-year-old Australian pulled clear to control the race until losing out in the pit-stops, when the Briton gained an advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren pitted him first for an 'undercut' to fend off seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes who finished third after surviving a skirmish with Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This resulted in Norris, who had superior pace, inheriting the lead, leading into the closing laps and receiving repeated orders to give back his position – and victory – to Piastri, who was struggling to close the gap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After prolonged strained dialogue on the team radio, Norris agreed to slow down and let Piastri pass him with three laps remaining, despite knowing he was losing a chance to cut substantially into Max Verstappen's lead in the drivers' championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A very special day for me," said Piastri. "This is the day I've dreamed of as a kid, to be standing on the top step of an F1 podium. A bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he was unfazed by the team orders arguments played out over the closing laps as McLaren asked Norris to slow down, preserve his tyres and allow Piastri to catch and pass him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer you leave it, of course, you get a bit nervous, but it was well-executed by the team and it was the right thing to do. I had put myself in the right position at the start," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the different strategies we had, my pace probably wasn't as quick as I would have liked in the last stint, but I was still in the right position to make it happen." (AFP)

 State media on Sunday said rescuers had found the bodies of ten people swept away by flash floods in Sichuan province, as extreme weather continues in many parts of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official Xinhua news agency said 29 people remained missing after heavy rain triggered the flooding at a village under the city of Ya’an.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers were reported to be using drones, sniffer dogs and life detectors to search for the missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting the scene, Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing called for all-out efforts to rescue the missing. He also said efforts should be increased to prevent secondary disasters, such as mudslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said local authorities across the country should further strengthen preparations for heavy rain and flooding, especially in vulnerable areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Xinhua reported that 15 bodies had now been found after Friday’s collapse of a highway bridge in Shaanxi province. That disaster was also triggered by heavy rain.

    Chinese at more risk from brain complication: study

<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at the Chinese University's Faculty of Medicine say they’ve found that patients who are of Chinese ethnicity are at higher risk of death if they develop a complication linked to blood thinning treatment for heart disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The study analysed the clinical and imaging data of 232 patients who experienced an intracerebral haemorrhage between 2016 and 2021. It found that 70 percent of Chinese patients had a poor neurological outcome and almost 40 percent died within 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European and American studies, meanwhile, found that only around 50 percent of patients suffered severe neurological disability and there was a 28 percent mortality rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a very impactful finding,” said Dr Bonaventure Ip, an assistant professor of neurology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such a study has never been performed among the Asian or Chinese patients. That is exactly why we need to have a better management strategy for patients [with the disease]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Direct oral anticoagulants are widely used to reduce the risk of stroke, as the drug prevents clots from forming inside blood vessels. However, one in every thousand patients face the risk of developing intracerebral haemorrhage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings were released on Monday, to mark World Brain Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team said people should maintain healthy habits, such as eating a balanced diet, exercise regularly and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption. They say such habits are especially important for people with atrial fibrillation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team also urged people to immediately seek help if they experience symptoms of stroke, including inability to move one side of their limbs, facial asymmetry, drooling of saliva and slurring of speech.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal gets a hug from Nuno Borges after his defeat in the Bastad Open final. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762566_1_20240721222405.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal lost his first final in two years on Sunday as the Spaniard went down 6-3, 6-2 to Portugal's Nuno Borges at the clay-court Bastad Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish tennis great had shown signs of a return to form in Scandinavia as he made an impressive run to the final, just one week before tennis at the Olympic Games gets under way on the clay in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nadal, rather than celebrating his 64th title on the surface and first since Roland Garros 2022, was dominated by Borges as he struggled to find fluency with his serve and ground strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know what to say. I think I was wishing for this moment for a while already," said Borges in his post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's crazy, in tennis it doesn't happen when you expect it sometimes. I know we all wanted Rafa to win, a part of me wished that too, but something even bigger inside of me really pushed through today... I'm just really happy overall. I really don't know what to say, I'm very emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges was the first to make headway in the match when he broke the Spaniard's serve to go 3-1 up, with Nadal saving break points before overcooking a forehand down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 14-time French Open winner struck back immediately on the Borges serve, earning two break-back points before the Portuguese dumped a forehand into the net from inside the service box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But neither player could quite grab the ascendancy in the first set as Borges quickly ran up a 0-40 lead in the next service game, converting his second break point with a perfectly executed drop shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal was struggling to find his first serve but managed to hold just his second service game of the opening set to force Borges to serve one more time. The world number 51 kept his nerve to do just that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old showed signs of his old self serving at deuce in the first game of the second set with a booming forehand winner down the line, before he eventually held but that was one of the few highlights for Nadal on the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges then struck at 2-2 as he broke Nadal's serve for the first time in the second set and fourth time overall to edge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old followed it up by winning the next three games, sealing a maiden career title in his first-ever match-up against the former world number one with an ace. (AFP)

    Paris rejects 4,000 Games accreditation requests

<div class="itemFullText">
 French security services rejected more than 4,000 applications for Paris 2024 Olympics accreditations, including over espionage and cyberattack concerns, the country's caretaker interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gerald Darmanin said French authorities have so far checked close to one million accreditation requests for the Games that kick off on July 26 and had rejected 4,340 people, some over radical Islamist connections or suspicion of being foreign spies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to one hundred were rejected over espionage fears or concerns they were agents trying to get an accreditation using a different profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are probably not there to carry out attacks. But in addition to intelligence and traditional espionage, there is the possibility of accessing entry points into computer networks to carry out a cyberattack," Darmanin told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they had applied as journalists or technical staff and their countries of origin were Russia and Belarus, among others, which he did not name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we refused a large number of 'journalists' who claimed to cover the Games. On the other hand, we accepted the presence of Russians who work for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We apply the precautionary principle," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian journalists have been allowed to get accredited for the Games and have already arrived in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris will be deploying 45,000 security personnel to guarantee the safety of the Games and its unique opening ceremony along the river Seine where athletes will float on barges past hundreds of thousands of spectators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers have reduced the initial number of spectators from 600,000 to around 300,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To our knowledge, we have no known threat to the security of the Olympic Games," Darmanin said. "In the past days I did a new reconnaissance by boat on the Seine with the police. I confirm that the ceremony will take place in the format announced by the President of the Republic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the flow of the river and the low risk of bad weather, there is – to date – no identified threat to the Games. Neither our intelligence services nor the foreign services with which we coordinate have detected any foreign threat. But you have to stay very humble and focused." (Reuters)

    Bangladesh scraps most job quotas that sparked riots

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762546_1_20240721170912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh’s top court on Sunday scaled back a controversial quota system for government job applicants after it led to nationwide unrest and deadly clashes between police and protesters that killed scores of people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court in its verdict ordered 93 percent of government jobs to be allocated on a merit-based system, leaving the remaining seven percent for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971 and other categories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the system reserved 30 percent of such jobs for the relatives of war veterans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's verdict comes after weeks of demonstrations — mostly led by students — that turned deadly on Tuesday after protesters began clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the week, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters who filled the streets and university campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporadic clashes in some parts of Dhaka, the capital, were reported on Saturday but it was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladeshi authorities haven’t shared any official numbers of those killed and injured, but the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported Saturday that at least 103 people have died so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the court's hearing, soldiers patrolled cities across the South Asian country, while a nationwide curfew and an internet blackout remained in force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the curfew will be relaxed from 3 pm to 5 pm on Sunday for people to run essential errands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government has declared Sunday and Monday as public holidays, with only emergency services allowed to operate. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Correctional Services Department (CSD) on Sunday said a 60-year-old man, who was remanded in custody at Pak Sha Wan Correctional Institution, had died at a public hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 60-year-old was accused of indecent conduct towards a child under the age of 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said he was suffering from liver cirrhosis, a condition caused by long-term liver damage resulting in scarring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was sent to hospital 10 days ago and was pronounced dead at 9 am on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CSD has informed the police and a death inquest will be conducted by the Coroner's Court.

    Trump holds first rally since assassination attempt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US presidential candidate Donald Trump, holding his first campaign rally since surviving an assassination attempt a week ago, rejected concerns he was a threat to America's democratic system, telling the crowd: "I took a bullet for democracy."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I'm not an extremist at all," the newly-crowned Republican presidential nominee continued at the rally in swing state Michigan, dismissing his reported links to Project 2025, a manifesto from the Heritage Foundation that has been characterised by opponents as an authoritarian, right-wing wish list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he mocked the rival Democratic Party, roiled by unprecedented pressure for US President Joe Biden to abandon his re-election bid, amid concerns over his age and fitness to serve, if re-elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have no idea who their candidate is...this guy [Biden] goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That's democracy," Trump told the 12,000-strong crowd of supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fiery, but typically rambling speech, the Republican riffed on his hardline immigration views, espoused falsehoods about migrant crime, and repeated his baseless claim that Democrats "rigged" the 2020 election. (AFP)

    Guidelines not meant to find faults: sports bosses

<div class="itemFullText">
 New guidelines on the corporate governance of sports associations are expected to be unveiled in mid-September, Hong Kong's sports bosses said on Sunday, stressing they were not trying to pinpoint any shortcomings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China has been conducting a review of the corporate governance of national sports associations in the SAR following an audit report in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary-general of the federation, said the sports governing body had submitted a plan to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not about fault-finding, picking out what is wrong. We always look at our national sports associations as our affiliates. They need our support, and what is right should stay, what is wrong should be changed. We need to keep up with the times. Times have changed and what's appropriate in the past may not be nowadays," Yang told a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[By doing so,] we hope the selection of athletes can meet our current requirements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Kenneth Fok said it's important for the sports governing body to conduct a "health check".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he urged people not to question the governance of the entire sports sector based on isolated incidents, saying that a majority of associations and organisations under the governing body had been able to promote sports development professionally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the upcoming Paris Olympics, Fok, who is also the federation's vice-president, said he believed there would not be blunders involving the national anthem at the Games as there were procedures in place to ensure the correct song was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe there will not be any mistakes at the Olympics, because it is the most sought-after event around the world. The organising committee would arrange for us to verify the national anthem and flags, and the whole process would require signatures," Fok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have to tell our athletes that some audience members are very enthusiastic and they will bring regional and national flags to the venues. But sometimes, they may have the wrong versions. So we have urged athletes not to take the flags given to them, because it would become their responsibility once they take the flags."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending 35 athletes to Paris, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fok called on the public to support them regardless of whether they win a medal or not, saying he was confident in the athletes' performance at the Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of a book fair in Wan Chai reminded exhibitors to comply with event regulations and all applicable laws in Hong Kong, including the national security law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Publisher Bbluesky, which is one of the exhibitors at the book fair, told RTHK on Saturday it was reminded by the Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which organised the book fair, to remove five titles from its booth, citing complaints and the perceived "sensitive" nature of their content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the books was one about media ethics by seasoned journalist Allan Au, and another written by former lawmaker and ex-prisoner Shiu Ka-chun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boundary Bookstore also said it removed four titles from its booth, after receiving the same reminder from the HKTDC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have the absolute and exclusive authority to determine our participation in the book fair, and what kinds of books we can have in the booth.They're exercising their rights, but it's a bit too stringent. It's also a bit hasty, because they only ask us to remove those books verbally - without providing any documentation," Leanne Liu of Boundary Bookstore told RTHK on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to questions from RTHK, a spokesperson for the HKTDC said the council would handle any complaints regarding suspected violations of event regulations in accordance with procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added the HKTDC would request exhibitors to stop displaying and selling the items in question when necessary.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean officials said North Korea launched more balloons likely carrying trash towards the South on Sunday, days after Seoul restarted blaring anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts across the border in retaliation for the North’s repeated balloon campaigns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Cold War-style psychological battle between the two Koreas is adding to tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the rivals threatening stronger steps against each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North Korean balloons were flying north of Seoul, the South Korean capital, after crossing the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the public should be alert for falling objects and report to police and military authorities if they see any balloons on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea’s latest balloon-flying is the ninth of its kind since late May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has floated more than 2,000 balloons to drop waste paper, scraps of cloth, cigarette butts, waste batteries and even manure on South Korea, though they have so far caused no major damage in South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has said the balloons were launched in response to South Korean activists sending political leaflets to the North via their own balloons. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says three local exhibitions, including the book fair, have attracted a total of 760 exhibitors.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong should strengthen its online sales sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said online retail sales have surged nearly 60 percent between 2020 and 2023, reaching HK$32.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the growth, Chan noted that online sales in Hong Kong only accounted for eight percent of total retail sales, lower than the 28 percent seen on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was providing support to local small and medium enterprises to expand their business opportunities, by enhancing their popularity on mainland online platforms and gaining a deeper understanding of the online sales market in the rest of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the Trade Development Council would organise the first Hong Kong Shopping Festival next month, to help local enterprises enter the mainland market and revitalise Hong Kong brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 230 brands will have the opportunity to showcase their products, ranging from groceries to cosmetic items, on mainland online sales platforms during the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locally, Chan said three large-scale exhibitions - the book fair, sports and leisure expo, and a snack-themed exhibition - had attracted 760 exhibitors, serving as important promotion platforms for businesses in the city.

    Airports start to return to normal after global outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Planes were gradually taking off again on Saturday after global airlines, banks and media were thrown into turmoil by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Airport Authority said most systems are operating normally again, but contingency plans remain in place, and mainland state media said Beijing's airports had not been affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passenger crowds had swelled at airports on Friday as dozens of flights were cancelled after an update to a programme operating on Microsoft Windows crashed systems worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday, officials said the situation had returned virtually to normal in airports across Germany and France, as Paris prepared to welcome millions for the Olympic Games starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple US airlines and airports across Asia said they had resumed operations, with check-in services restored in Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand, and mostly back to normal in India, Indonesia and at Singapore's Changi Airport as of Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft estimated Saturday that 8.5 million Windows devices were affected in the global IT crash, adding that the number amounted to less than one percent of all Windows machines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services", it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft said the issue began at 1900 GMT on Thursday, affecting Windows users running the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Saturday blog post, CrowdStrike said it had released an update on Thursday night that had caused a system crash and the infamous "blue screen of death" fatal error message.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem, and the company's boss, George Kurtz, told US news channel CNBC he wanted to "personally apologise to every organisation, every group and every person who has been impacted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company also said it could take a few days for things to fully get back to normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's National Health Service was hobbled by the crash on Friday, preventing doctors from accessing patient records and booking appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "majority of systems... are now coming back online in most areas, however they are still running slightly slower than usual", an NHS spokesperson said, warning of disruption continuing into next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media companies were also hit, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its Friday morning news broadcasts. Australia's ABC also reported major difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian, British and German authorities warned of an increase in scam and phishing attempts following the outage, including people offering to help reboot computers and asking for personal information or credit card details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks in Kenya and Ukraine reported issues with their digital services, some mobile phone carriers were disrupted and customer services in a number of companies went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of this outage is unprecedented, and will no doubt go down in history," said Junade Ali of Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology, adding that the last incident approaching the same scale was in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some airports halted all flights, in others airline staff resorted to manual check-ins for passengers, leading to long lines and frustrated travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of US flights were grounded, although airlines later said they were re-establishing their services and working through the backlog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said Friday that "our understanding is that flight operations have resumed across the country, although some congestion remains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's largest airline Indigo said Saturday that operations had been "resolved", adding in a statement on X that the process of resuming normal operations would "extend into the weekend".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Low-cost carrier AirAsia said it was still trying to get back online and had been "working around the clock towards recovering its departure control systems".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said the issue was "not the result of or related to a cyberattack". (AFP)

Image: Courtesy of the HKO" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762502_1_20240721064733.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Monday morning said it expects the Standby Signal No 1 to stay in force until at least noon, though it's unlikely to issue a higher warning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number one signal was issued at 10.40pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of 4.45am on Monday, Tropical Storm Prapiroon was predicted to skirt more than 500 kilometres to the southwest of Hong Kong before moving away. It made landfall over Hainan Island at about 1.30am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unless Prapiroon intensifies significantly, the chance of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals will be rather low," the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with Prapiroon are affecting the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary, the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locally, winds were occasionally strong offshore and on high ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public have been advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile another tropical cyclone, Gaemi, is expected to move towards the seas east of Taiwan and intensify significantly in the next couple of days. It's expected to bring very hot weather with a few showers to Hong Kong in the middle of the week.

    Horschel leads Open one shot ahead of chasing pack

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Billy Horschel goes into the final day at Royal Troon just one shot in front. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762497_1_20240721041942.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American Billy Horschel leads the British Open at four under par heading into Sunday's final round after torrential rain and a swirling wind at Royal Troon blew the challenge for the Claret Jug wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Horschel leads by one from a group of six, featuring USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, South Africa's Thriston Lawrence and Americans Sam Burns and Russell Henley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler is just one shot further back at two under after battling to an even par round of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 12 players are within four shots of the lead for what promises to be a fascinating final round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader Shane Lowry had a day to forget as the 2019 champion crumbled in the sodden conditions to collapse from eight under par after seven holes to one under by the end of his round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Horschel was one of the big movers in a round that had allowed for lower scoring earlier in the day before the wind and rain picked up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting at two under, Horschel produced a sublime four-under 32 on the front nine thanks to birdies at four, six, seven and nine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bogey followed at 11 before another dropped shot at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown, ranked 272 in the world, had been set to lead heading into the final round until a double bogey at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he and Rose remain in the hunt to become the first English winner since Nick Faldo in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry began the day with a two-shot lead and extended that to three with a birdie at the par-five fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Irishman's round began to come off the rails with a double bogey at the 130-yard Postage Stamp eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worse was to come as five bogeys in eight holes on the back nine dropped Lowry back into ninth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh from his maiden major win at the USPGA, Schauffele is eyeing another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three moved to five under at one stage before bogeys at 11 and 18 knocked him back to three under after a round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll let myself dream tonight," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler is also right in the mix to win his third major and win for a seventh time in 15 starts this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A birdie at the third got the American off to a fine start but he then played the next 13 holes in two over before picking up a shot at the 17th to remain ominously poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The back nine, I think that was probably the hardest nine holes that I'll ever play," said Scheffler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence, Burns and Henley made the most of the benign early morning conditions to shoot through the pack to three under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence and Burns posted six-under 65s, while Henley made 66 to move into contention before the leaders had to face the worst of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time major champion Justin Thomas and former Masters winner Adam Scott also impressed to move to level par and remain on the fringes of the battle for the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the challenge from the big names on the breakaway Liv circuit failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jon Rahm slipped back to two over, while Brooks Koepka is back at eight over after a 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the loudest cheers of the week so far was reserved for Kim Si-woo after he produced the longest hole-in-one in British Open history on the 17th that brought him back to five over for the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was not doing very well, and then I was feeling terrible for my shots the last couple days. Then finally I got the best golf shot I've ever had this week," said the South Korean. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal reached his first final since winning the 2022 French Open, defeating Croatian qualifier Duje Ajdukovic in a three-set tussle in Bastad on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after his four-hour quarter-final victory, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was again tested to the limit by Ajdukovic, the world number 130 who had won just two tour-level matches before this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard rebounded from dropping the opening set to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, returning to the final of a tournament he won as a teenager in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will play Portuguese seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on Sunday as he goes in search of the 93rd singles title of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most recent triumph came two years ago at Roland Garros, when he won the tournament for a record-extending 14th time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal is using the event in Bastad as a tune-up for the Paris Olympics, where the tennis will be played on the clay at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old returned to action this week for the first time since losing in the first round of the French Open in late May. (AFP)

    Pogacar wins fifth stage on Tour as victory nears

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tadej Pogacar celebrates after winning stage 20 of the 2024 Tour de France. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762491_1_20240721013834.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall leader Tadej Pogacar won for a fifth time on this Tour de France on Saturday, moving to the brink of a third title, as defending champion Jonas Vingegaard came second and Remco Evenepoel dropped around a minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just Sunday's concluding time trial to come, two-time champion Pogacar has a five minute 14-second lead over Vingegaard as he effectively made sure of becoming the first man in 26 years to capture the Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's action culminated on the tough Col de Couillole climb where Evenepoel attacked Vingegaard in an attempt to take second place overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead he himself dropped around 53sec on the Dane, making it less likely the Belgian can claim second place after Sunday's time trial, where he is favourite for the stage win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel did however virtually guarantee third place overall and the white jersey as best young rider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic champion Richard Carapaz, regarded as the most combative rider on the 2024 Tour, will win the climb points jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carapaz came third on Saturday, won a stage and even took the yellow jersey for a day early in the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 3,498km on this 2024 Tour there remains just 34, a challenging run along the narrow, undulating corniche between the principality of Monaco, where many in the peloton live, and the French Riviera town of Nice. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli warplanes struck the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida on Saturday, a day after a Houthi drone attack killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, the rebels said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a "brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Axios news outlet cited US and Israeli officials as saying that Israel carried out the strikes in retaliation for a Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi attack on Friday penetrated Israel's vaunted air defences and killed a civilian in a Tel Aviv apartment building, drawing Israeli threats of retaliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi-run health ministry said there were deaths and injuries in the Hodeida strikes but it did not give a toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Al Masirah television, it said several people suffered "serious burns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage aired by Al Masirah, which has not been independently verified, showed a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness in Hodeida reported hearing several large explosions and seeing smoke over the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel pumps across the city closed following the attack, the correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hodeida has been hard hit by a series of strikes carried out by Britain and the United States since January in response to attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis have attacked at least 88 commercial vessels since November in a campaign they say targets Israeli-linked shipping in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza war. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris claimed pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday ahead of Oscar Piastri as McLaren celebrated their first front row lock-out in over a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen took third in qualifying to start Sunday's race on the second row with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz for company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's under pressure teammate Sergio Perez crashed out in the first session, triggering a red flag and increasing pressure on his job as the Dutch driver's number two at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Ricciardo, a former winner at the circuit, produced a late flash of speed once Q1 resumed to top the times in his RB from Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes with the seven-time champion's teammate George Russell the big name absentee from Q2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris led the pack into the top-10 shoot out, with Hamilton, who broke his lengthy winless run at Silverstone last time out, sneaking through with the slowest time of the middle leg of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuki Tsunoda ended up in a wall in his RB, forcing a second red flag with just two minutes left and Norris and Piastri provisionally locking out the front row for McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen had to sit out the conclusion of qualifying when it resumed after Tsunoda's stricken RB was removed due to an issue with his car as McLaren sealed the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton is on the third row after the fifth fastest time ahead of Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari, Aston Martin duo Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll, with Ricciardo and Tsunoda completing the top 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen leads Norris by 84 points going into Sunday's race at the Hungaroring. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 at 10.40 pm, as the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remains rather loose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tropical depression is expected to strengthen slightly and adopt a more northwesterly track during the day. The Standby Signal No 1 will remain in force at least until 5 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is now centred within about 700 kilometres of Hong Kong and may still affect us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with it and the southwest monsoon are covering the central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the present forecast, the tropical cyclone will intensify and gradually take a more northwesterly track, moving in the general direction to the vicinity of Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under its influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later tomorrow. There will be swells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.

    Bangladesh army on streets as police shoot protesters

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The military has been deployed to enforce a nationwide curfew. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762476_1_20240720212531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Soldiers were patrolling Bangladeshi cities on Saturday to quell growing civil unrest sparked by student demonstrations, with riot police firing on protesters who defied a government curfew.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's violence has killed at least 123 people so far, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, and poses a monumental challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government curfew went into effect at midnight and the premier's office asked the military to deploy troops after police again failed to subdue widespread mayhem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The army has been deployed nationwide to control the law and order situation," said armed forces spokesman Shahdat Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The curfew will remain in effect until at least 10:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday, private broadcaster Channel 24 reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Streets in the capital Dhaka were almost deserted at daybreak, with troops on foot and in armoured personnel carriers patrolling the sprawling megacity of 20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But thousands returned to the streets later in the day in the residential neighbourhood of Rampura, with police firing at the crowd and wounding at least one person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our backs are to the wall," protester Nazrul Islam, 52, said at the scene. "There's anarchy going on in the country... They are shooting at people like birds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals have reported a growing number of gunshot deaths since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of thousands of people" had battled police across the capital on Friday, said police spokesman Faruk Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At least 150 police officers were admitted to hospital. Another 150 were given first aid treatment," he said, adding that two officers had been beaten to death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protesters torched many police booths... Many government offices were torched and vandalised."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said that another two police officers were killed on Saturday, while four people admitted to intensive care succumbed to their injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more protesters were killed in the industrial town of Savar on Dhaka's outskirts, a major centre of Bangladesh's garment exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enam Medical College Hospital spokesman Zahidur Rahman confirmed the latter deaths, adding that "nine people came here with bullet wounds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, said that two of its leaders had been arrested since Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a planned diplomatic tour but abandoned her plans after a week of escalating violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has cancelled her Spain and Brazil tours due to the prevailing situation," said her press secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits families loyal to Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the first deaths on Tuesday, protesters have begun demanding Hasina leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not about the rights of the students anymore," said business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, at the scene of the Rampura protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are here as the general public now," he added. "Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre Prakash of Crisis Group said the lack of competitive elections since Hasina took office had led to mounting public frustration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With no real alternative at the ballot box, discontented Bangladeshis have few options besides street protests to make their voices heard," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rising death toll is a shocking indictment of the absolute intolerance shown by the Bangladeshi authorities to protest and dissent," Babu Ram Pant of Amnesty International said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities imposed a nationwide internet shutdown on Thursday that remains in effect, severely hampering communication in and out of Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government websites remain offline and major newspapers including the Dhaka Tribune and Daily Star have been unable to update their social media platforms since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh Television, the state broadcaster, also remains offline after its Dhaka headquarters was set on fire by protesters the same day. (AFP)

    Former world snooker champion Reardon dies aged 91

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world champion Ray Reardon, the coal miner who dominated snooker in the 1970s, has died at the age of 91.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Welshman Reardon had previously been diagnosed with cancer and passed away on Friday night, his wife Carol confirmed on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91," a World Snooker Tour statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jimmy White, one of snooker's most popular players, said on X: "Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978, earning an MBE in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed 'Dracula' after playing a session of the 1974 World Championship final in a cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket, Reardon rose to prominence as snooker became a popular sport in Britain thanks to the Pot Black television programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most," Reardon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He battled the flamboyant Alex Higgins in a long-running rivalry with the "Hurricane" that included an epic 18-15 defeat in the 1982 World Championship final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number one worked as a coal miner and was also a police officer for eight years before taking snooker by storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was fortunate to survive a mining accident when a 12-foot girder and a deluge of rubble crashed down on him while he was building a pit lane, leaving him trapped for three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right," he wrote in his autobiography.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon retired in 1991 at the age of 58 but remained in the snooker world, helping Ronnie O'Sullivan as a consultant during his run to the 2004 world title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Welsh Open trophy was named in Reardon's honour in 2016. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said young people from Hong Kong can play a key role in the nation's technological development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong said people in Hong Kong now had a better understanding of the country, as patriotic education had been integrated into their daily lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hoped the territory's young people can use their knowledge of technology to offer more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a relatively strong foundation in technology, and has many high-quality tech talents who love the country and Hong Kong," he said at an awards ceremony honouring the work of teenagers in aerospace innovation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an important driving factor in the country's development into an innovative nation... I hope Hong Kong teenagers can reach the peak of technology through their hard work and ambition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the country had high hopes that Hong Kong would develop into an international innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authorities will continue their efforts to nurture the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology is the primary productive force; talent is the primary opportunity; and innovation is the primary driving force," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government attaches great importance to the development of innovation and technology, making every effort to cultivate local talent and increase investment in the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that a Hong Kong resident had been selected for the national manned space programme, and he hopes more young people can aim to join developments in the national aerospace industry.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn has welcomed a decision by town planners to approve zoning plans for San Tin Technopole, a project that will see the creation of an information and technology hub in an area that now contains fish ponds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Linn said the administration was now looking at ways to speed up the development process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Town Planning Board gave its approval on Friday, saying the decision was made after considering the views of various stakeholder groups, government responses, as well as hours of internal discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the majority of its members agreed the technopole is strategically important for development of the SAR’s technology sector, given its proximity to the Shenzhen IT zone.

  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Linn said the administration may speed up the work by selling plots at the same time as carrying out land formation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why is it beneficial if we can sell the land while land formation is under way? The developers who buy the land can immediately start working on building plans. This eliminates the need for everyone to wait for each other," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the administration will apply for funding from the Legislative Council's Finance Committee, saying that if land formation work can commence by the end of this year, the first batch of formed land could be ready in 2026.

  Asked about what conservation work would be conducted, given that some 90 hectares of fish ponds will need to be reclaimed under the development plan, Linn said the impact is less significant than it seems, saying that more than half of the fish ponds affected are already abandoned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development minister reiterated that the administration will stick to its promise and build a 338-hectare wetland conservation park alongside the technology hub as compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Science Park also welcomed the Town Planning Board's decision, saying the technology hub will provide additional space for research and collaboration between Hong Kong and the rest of Greater Bay Area.
