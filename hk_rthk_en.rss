    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police and the Monetary Authority say there were over 2,700 fraud cases of swindlers pretending to be workers of online service or social media platforms during the first half of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are stepping up publicity efforts against fraud after the number of deception cases in Hong Kong went up by 6.2 percent to nearly 20,000 in the first half of the year, incurring losses of $4.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But instead of the elderly, the force is now actively reaching out to young people after noticing a demographic shift in victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all fraud cases between January and June, 1,605 involved victims who fell prey to swindlers claiming to be customer service representatives of online platforms such as Taobao and WeChat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That number shot up to 1,111 in July alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-fifth of those victims were aged between 18 and 29, compared to only seven percent who were 70 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's because WeChat Pay and Taobao are commonly used by young persons, and they are the tech-savvy generation," said senior superintendent Tsang Nga-sze of Commercial Crime Bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the cases, a 50-year-old clerk lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to a swindler posing as a WeChat representative last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was told by the fraudster that he had subscribed to an insurance scheme with an annual fee of $70,000, and the plan would be renewed automatically if he didn't complete the cancellation process within that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the scammer's instructions over the phone, he transferred a "guarantee payment" to the swindler, in a bid to verify his identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the process, the scammer sent me some links with bank logos on it, and also [showed me] their staff card, which made me believe that the fraudster was a genuine WeChat representative," the victim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He only realised he had been conned after he was ordered to set up a virtual bank account, apply for a loan and then transfer the all money to a designated account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police warned that September and October are peak months for mainland students to get scammed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, scammers will use the excuse that their visas have some issues because they are involved in some investigations," said superintendent Theodora Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As they are new to Hong Kong, and really want to study or work here ... they will believe that they are the true officials from mainland China ... and make relevant transfers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force emphasised that the public should ignore calls and messages involving money, or asking for personal details.

    Ernesto restrengthens into Atlantic hurricane

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Swells from Ernesto are affecting parts of the Bahamas, Bermuda, the US East Coast and Atlantic Canada. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766687_1_20240819064816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ernesto restrengthened into a hurricane on Sunday as it travelled well off the shore of eastern United States, threatening wind and rain along the US and Canadian coasts after pummelling Puerto Rico and Bermuda.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hurricane, whose centre is forecast to pass near southeastern Newfoundland, Canada late on Monday into Tuesday, was creating dangerous conditions for residents and vacationers along the North American Atlantic seaboard, the US National Hurricane Center said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beach goers should be aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards," the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ernesto brushed past Puerto Rico earlier in the week leaving more than 600,000 customers without power, then hit Bermuda directly on Saturday, causing more than 70 percent of customers to lose electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Weeks, Bermuda's minister of national security, reported on Sunday that the island "made it through Hurricane Ernesto without any injuries or major incidents," according to The Royal Gazette newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres per hour, Ernesto was a Category 1 storm on the five-level Saffir-Simpson scale as of the NHC's latest advisory at 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) on Sunday, with some increase in speed expected overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swells from Ernesto are affecting parts of the Bahamas, Bermuda, the US East Coast and Atlantic Canada, the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, with the storm located some 520 miles south of Halifax in Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warmer-than-normal Atlantic waters threaten to supercharge this year's hurricane season, scientists have warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on. (AFP)

    Putin arrives in Azerbaijan for state visit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Vladimir Putin is greeted by Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766680_1_20240819043411.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Azerbaijan's capital Baku on Sunday for a two-day state visit, Russian news agencies reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russian television broadcast images of the Russian president's plane as it arrived in Baku in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit to the Caucasus country, a close partner of both Moscow and Turkey but also a major energy supplier to Western countries, comes against the backdrop of an unprecedented Ukrainian military offensive on Russian soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is due to hold talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on bilateral relations and "international and regional problems," the Kremlin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders were dining on Sunday evening at the Azerbaijani president's official residence, local official news agency Asertac said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Aliyev and Putin will sign joint documents and make statements to the press, said Russian agency Ria Novosti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin will also lay a wreath on the tomb of Heydar Aliyev, father of the current leader, who was president from 1993 to 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Kremlin said they would also discuss "the question of settling (the conflict) between Azerbaijan and Armenia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan reconquered the mountainous enclave in September 2023 from the Armenian separatists who had held it for three decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia accused Russia of inadequate support in its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Armenia has sought to deepen its ties with Western countries, especially the United States, much to the annoyance of Moscow, which considers both former Soviet republics to be in its sphere of influence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan is a major producer of natural gas, to whom many European countries turned to make up for the sharp reduction in Russian deliveries after the start of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also hosting the COP29 climate conference in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's last visit to Azerbaijan was in September 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has been under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court since March 2023 for the "deportation" of Ukrainian children to Russia, an accusation the Kremlin denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the threat of arrest has limited Putin's travels abroad, Azerbaijan is not a signatory to the Rome Statute treaty that established the ICC. (AFP)

    Man City beat Chelsea to start title defence

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former Chelsea favourite Mateo Kovacic, (centre), beats Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez at his near post. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766678_1_20240819022912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City got their Premier League title defence off to a winning start as goals from Erling Haaland and Mateo Kovacic inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Enzo Maresca in his first match in charge of Chelsea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haaland marked his 100th appearance for the club with his 91st goal before Kovacic struck on his return to Stamford Bridge to give Pep Guardiola's men the perfect start to their attempt to win a record fifth consecutive English top-flight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were shorn of all four of their Euro 2024 finalists – Rodri, Kyle Waker, John Stones and Phil Foden – from the start as Guardiola opted to give them extra time off to recover from their summer exertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the champions were still able to lay down a marker against one of the few sides they failed to beat in the league last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca has the tough task of moulding a functioning team unit from a bloated Chelsea squad that has 43 players and over 50 on the books including those on loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consequences of those difficult decisions played out even before kick-off as Raheem Sterling's camp released a statement expressing his dismay at being left out of the matchday squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Chilwell was another to face the cull, while Conor Gallagher and Romelu Lukaku are among those not to have been handed squad numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  None of Chelsea's nine summer signings to date were included in Maresca's starting line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even more surprisingly, Enzo Fernandez was named captain despite being embroiled in a race row for a post on social media after Argentina's Copa America victory last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, by contrast, are a model of continuity and consistent excellence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland was one of City's few stars to have had a summer off from international tournaments and took just 18 minutes to make his mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku's low cross was deflected by Bernardo Silva into the Norwegian's path and he coolly dinked over Robert Sanchez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne curled inches wide and Sanchez leapt high to turn over Doku's deflected shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chelsea ended the first half in the ascendency and should have been level before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ederson spilled Cole Palmer's tame shot but was bailed out by Nicolas Jackson's straying needlessly offside before he turned in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden was forced into action earlier than Guardiola would have hoped at half-time as the lively Savinho was forced off injured on his Premier League debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of pre-season minutes for many on show was apparent in the more pedestrian pace than normal for a major Premier League clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea did most of the pressing for an equaliser but offered City chances to extend their lead in doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made a fine save to deny Haaland a second before De Bruyne again fired inches off target when unmarked at the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Chelsea goalkeeper was at fault for the goal that sealed their fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kovacic was allowed to burst through the midfield unchallenged and took aim for the top corner, which he found thanks to a weak hand from Sanchez. (AFP)

    Blinken in Israel as Netanyahu calls Hamas 'obstinate'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Antony Blinken arrives in Tel Aviv for his ninth trip to the Middle East since war broke out in October. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766674_1_20240819005215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's prime minister, under pressure at home and from abroad to reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas, on Sunday accused the militants of obstinance in Gaza truce talks as top US diplomat Antony Blinken landed in Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Making his ninth trip to the Middle East since the Gaza war began when Hamas attacked Israel in October, the US secretary of state is to meet Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders in a renewed bid to seal a deal that could help avert a wider conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken is later set to travel on Tuesday to Cairo, where ceasefire talks will resume in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday reiterated that it is Palestinian Islamist group Hamas that must be pressured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas, up to this moment, remains obstinate. It did not even send a representative to the talks in Doha. Therefore, the pressure should be directed at Hamas and (Yahya) Sinwar, not at the Israeli government," Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting, referring to the Hamas chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order that an agreement be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to his governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Blinken's visit, the foreign ministers of Britain and France were on Friday also in Israel to stress the urgency of a Gaza deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, US President Joe Biden laid out a framework which he said was proposed by Israel. The UN Security Council later endorsed the proposal, which would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks as Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters the besieged Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the truce talks in Doha last Thursday and Friday, Hamas called on mediators to implement the Biden framework rather than holding more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas also announced its opposition to what it called "new conditions" from Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, Netanyahu's office in a statement said Israeli negotiators have expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a Gaza truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have also reported progress and a US official said remaining gaps were "bridgeable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after Biden said "we are closer than we have ever been" to a deal, Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed as "an illusion" such optimistic talk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous announcements that a deal was close during the months of on-off truce negotiations proved unfounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the stakes have risen since the late July killings in quick succession of Iran-backed militant leaders, including Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, and as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, deepened with a feared polio outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli evacuation orders have "reduced the safe zone" in the south of the territory, leaving "no more space" for displaced Palestinians, said Samah Dib, 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people "are sleeping on the street" while clean water is scarce and "there's food at the markets, but it's very expensive and we have no money left," said Dib, who like almost all Gazans is among the displaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As efforts towards a long-sought truce continued, so has the violence in Gaza but also in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war. They did so again on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence rescuers in Hamas-run Gaza reported seven killed in Israeli bombardment of Deir el-Balah and four others in air strikes on the northern Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest killings helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death toll to 40,099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops continued operations in central and southern Gaza and "eliminated" militants in Rafah, on the territory's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the Israeli-designated safe zone in southern Gaza's Al-Mawasi, Lina Saleha, 44, said she could hear "constant artillery shelling" and the rumble of tanks "getting closer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's not a good sign and we're terrified and afraid," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the West Bank, Israel said late on Saturday it had killed "two senior Hamas officials" in Jenin. Hamas's armed wing confirmed the deaths of two militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lebanon, the UN said three peacekeepers were lightly injured in a blast in the country's south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and its regional allies have vowed retaliation for Haniyeh's death in Tehran – which Israel has not claimed responsibility for – and for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees," the US State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club watchdog said that since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces have detained "more than 10,000 Palestinians" in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in 1967.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in the Israeli city of Haifa on Saturday, Guri Lotto, 51, said he was protesting to "put pressure on the government" to secure a hostage release deal and end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US official travelling with Blinken said on condition of anonymity that "the feeling is... that various sticking points that existed before are bridgeable, and that work's going to continue."

    Toney-less Brentford get the better of Crystal Palace

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brentford shrugged off the absence of Ivan Toney to get their Premier League season off to a flying start with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa got the goals for the Bees, who had left out England international Toney over speculation surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toney has less than a year left to run on his contract with the London club and is attracting interest from Saudi clubs after his role in helping England to the Euro 2024 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford boss Thomas Frank said pre-match his side had shown last season they can cope without Toney – who missed much of last term due to a betting ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guehi did captain Crystal Palace despite the interest in him shown by Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England defender had an outstanding Euros but a moment to forget for Brentford's opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbeumo raced onto Wissa's pass and cut inside Guehi before firing into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palace ended last season in sensational form under Oliver Glasner and will feel hard done by not to have earned at least a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eberechi Eze had a brilliantly executed near post free-kick harshly ruled out for a foul by Will Hughes when the score was still level at 0-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bright Palace start to the second half was rewarded when Ethan Pinnock turned Daniel Munoz's header into his own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seconds later, Odsonne Edouard slotted home Eze's pass only to be denied by a marginal offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was Brentford who grabbed the vital third goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dean Henderson could only parry Nathan Collins' shot straight into the path of Wissa, who bundled home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eze was twice denied by Mark Flekken in the closing stages but Brentford held out for an impressive three points. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine said on Sunday it had struck a second key bridge in the Kursk region, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes as Kyiv's unprecedented incursion on Russian soil stretched through its second week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia meanwhile ramped up pressure in east Ukraine, claiming to capture another village just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minus one more bridge," Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram, publishing an aerial video of a blast tearing through a bridge near the Russian town of Zvannoye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precision air strikes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear when Ukraine carried out the attack. Oleshchuk did not give a date and Russian military bloggers shared photos of destruction from what appeared to be the same bridge dated on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6, in its biggest attack on Russian territory since the Kremlin launched its assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Ukraine announced it had destroyed a separate bridge in the neighbouring town of Glushkovo, both of which lie on the river Seym that winds through the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on both bridges have left Russia with limited options to cross the river in the area, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said the destruction of one of the bridges had hindered evacuation efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian defence ministry said in a briefing it was pushing back against Ukraine's forces near several villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 120,000 people have fled the region since fighting began, according to Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia said on Sunday its forces had captured Svyrydonivka, another frontline settlement some 15 kilometres away from Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for the Russian army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of active operations, units of the Centre grouping of troops have liberated the village of Sviridonovka," Moscow's defence ministry said, using the Russian name for the village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian forces have been inching towards Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned earlier this week that Russia was a little over 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian forces earlier on Sunday announced they had thwarted a Russian missile attack on the capital Kyiv where air raid sirens sounded before dawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the third ballistic missile attack on the capital in August with a clear interval of six days between each attack," the Kyiv City Military Administration posted on Telegram after the early morning barrage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No damage or casualties were reported from the attack, which the administration said likely involved "North Korean ballistic missiles of the KN-23 type."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region early on Sunday morning, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos published on social media showed thick black smoke and bursts of flames coming from the site of the blaze, which the governor said was in the town of Proletarsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the southeast of the Rostov region, air defences repelled a drone attack. As a result of falling debris on the territory of industrial storage facilities in Proletarsk, a diesel fuel fire broke out," Governor Vasily Golubev said on Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At 05:35 (0235 GMT), firefighting at the industrial facility in Proletarsk was suspended due to a second drone attack," he added in an update to the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one was injured and firefighting efforts resumed shortly after, he said in a later post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Proletarsk is some 250 kilometres from the Ukraine border and some 350 kilometres from Kyiv-held areas of fighting on the eastern Ukrainian front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, in what it has called "fair" retaliation for attacks on its energy infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of trafficking and manufacturing dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, who claimed to be jobless, was detained as part of a police raid at an industrial unit in Tsuen Wan on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing the press on Sunday, senior inspector Chan Yu-wing from the Narcotics Bureau believed the suspect received instructions remotely from a syndicate on how to manufacture drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers have also confiscated 2kg of suspected ketamine, and 6kg of raw materials, with a total street value of $960,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also discovered a large quantity of corrosive substances. In fact, during storage or heating, these chemicals could easily catch fire or explode," Chan warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore, these drug syndicates are completely neglecting public safety. Their actions are extremely irresponsible. If members of the public or security guards in a building smell something suspicious coming from a unit, like a pungent chemical smell, they should contact the police immediately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect will appear before the West Kowloon Magistracy on Monday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has pledged to actively consider a proposal to set up a third medical school in Hong Kong to address the shortage of healthcare professionals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event honouring doctors on Sunday, Lo said the government will bolster the training of local doctors and retain medical personnel in public hospitals to tackle the staffing shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent years, the government has allocated over $30 billion to fund the construction of medical training facilities at universities," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, the SAR government will continue to support the two existing medical schools by enhancing their teaching capabilities, boosting admission quotas and sources. The government will also actively consider a proposal to establish a third medical school."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently only the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong offer medical programmes in the SAR, with the schools producing a combined 590 graduates each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Nancy Ip, told the media in February that she hoped to launch the city's third medical school by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She revealed the initial intake of 50 students would be gradually ramped up to 150 per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo also said in the mean time, the government will continue to introduce non-locally trained doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects more than 250 doctors who were trained overseas will have joined the public healthcare system by the end of this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday the city's economy is expected to improve next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a two-hour public forum in Tai Po to solicit views for the upcoming Policy Address, the SAR leader heard numerous appeals from the audience to prop up certain industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A securities worker said he had never seen so many brokerage firms shut down. While acknowledging efforts by the SAR administration to lure investment from abroad, he felt the sector has yet seen any material impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lee admitted "difficulties" and "challenges" in the current environment. He believed investors are taking a cautious approach, citing factors such as the upcoming US presidential election, the interest rate development, as well as geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, "those bet against Hong Kong in the long run will be the first to lose", Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the global economic axis is shifting to the East. We should focus on Asean countries and the Middle East, which are the new engines for global development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader was also urged to provide more support to the cultural, sports, and tourism sectors, fresh off stellar performances by Hong Kong's Olympians at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, culture, sports and tourism have been emphasised as a whole. We have had great news recently with the birth of the twin panda cubs, while two more giant pandas are on their way as a gift from the central authorities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More consultation forums will be held in the coming weeks, before Lee delivers his third annual policy blueprint in October.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government announced on Sunday that a delegation of national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics will visit Hong Kong at the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The elite athletes will arrive in the SAR by plane on August 29. Fans will have a chance to greet them at three public events - a gala show on the evening of August 30, and two concurrent demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park Swimming Pool on the morning of August 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will depart the city on the same afternoon and make their way to Macau, where they will stay another three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also meet local athletes at the Sports Institute, and attend a reception and banquet hosted by the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who exactly will be coming remains unknown, but the Leisure and Cultural Services Department confirmed there will be badminton and table tennis stars, as well gymnasts, divers and swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has expressed gratitude to the General Administration of Sport of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office for arranging the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong people will be able to share the national team's joy and triumphs, thereby strengthening their patriotic passion and national spirit, especially among the youngsters," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE noted past visits by the national team had "always been a craze", and hoped the athletes will share their journey of perseverance and success and promote the spirit of Chinese sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 tickets for the events will go on sale from 10am on Thursday. Each person can buy no more than two tickets, priced at $20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some seats have also been reserved for the underprivileged free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identity checks will be enforced at the door to weed out scalping activities, and the government urged spectators to arrive ahead of time.

    French actor Alain Delon dies aged 88

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Delon in the 1967 gangster film "Le Samourai". Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766641_1_20240818145229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French actor Alain Delon, who melted the hearts of millions of film fans whether playing a murderer, hoodlum or hitman in his postwar heyday, has died, French media reported on Sunday. He was 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delon had been in poor health since suffering a stroke in 2019, rarely leaving his estate in Douchy, in France's Val de Loire region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With striking blue eyes, Delon was sometimes referred to as the "French Frank Sinatra" for his handsome looks, a comparison Delon disliked. Unlike Sinatra, who always denied connections with the Mafia, Delon openly acknowledged his shady pals in the underworld.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a 1970 interview with the New York Times, Delon was asked about such acquaintances, one of whom was among the last "Godfathers" of the underworld in the Mediterranean port of Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most of them the gangsters I know ... were my friends before I became an actor," he said. "I don't worry about what a friend does. Each is responsible for his own act. It doesn't matter what he does."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon shot to fame in two films by Italian director Luchino Visconti, "Rocco and His Brothers" in 1960 and "The Leopard" in 1963.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He starred alongside venerable French elder Jean Gabin in Henri Verneuil's 1963 film "Melodie en Sous-Sol" ("Any Number Can Win") and was a major hit in Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 "Le Samourai" ("The Godson"). The role of a philosophical contract killer involved minimal dialogue and frequent solo scenes, and Delon shone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon became a star in France and was idolised by men and women in Japan, but never made it as big in Hollywood despite performing with American cinema giants, including Burt Lancaster when the Frenchman played apprentice-hitman Scorpio in the eponymous 1973 film.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1970 film "Borsalino", he starred with fellow French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, playing gangsters who come to blows in an unforgettable, stylised fight over a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowning moments also included 1969 erotic thriller "La Piscine" ("The Swimming Pool"), where Delon paired up with real-life lover Romy Schneider, in a sultry French Riviera saga of jealously and seduction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born just outside Paris on November 8, 1935, Delon started life on the back foot: he was put in foster care aged four after his parents divorced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran away from home at least once and was expelled several times from boarding schools before joining the Marines at 17 and serving in then French-ruled Indochina. There too he got into trouble over a stolen jeep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in France in the mid-50s, he worked as a porter at Paris wholesale food market, Les Halles, and spent time in the red-light Pigalle district before migrating to the cafes of the bohemian St. Germain des Pres area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There he met French actor Jean-Claude Brialy, who took him to the Cannes Film Festival, where he attracted the attention of an American talent scout who arranged a screen test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his film debut in 1957 in "Quand la femme s'en mele" ("Send a Woman When the Devil Fails").
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SULPHUROUS FRIENDS
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon was a businessman as well as an actor, leveraging his looks to sell branded cosmetics and dabbling in race-horses with old underworld friends. He invested in a racehorse stable with Jacky "Le Mat" Imbert, a notorious figure in a thriving Marseille crime scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's more louche friendships exploded to the surface when a former bodyguard-cum-confidant, a young Yugoslav called Stefan Markovic, was found dead in a bag, with a bullet in his head, discarded in a rubbish dump near Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor was interrogated and cleared by police but the "Markovic Affair" snowballed into a national scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man police charged with the Markovic murder - he was later acquitted - was Francois Marcantoni, a Corsican cafe owner and friend of Delon who thrived in the hustle and bustle of the Pigalle district in the aftermath of World War Two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon was outspoken off-stage and courted controversy when he did so - notably when he said he regretted the abolition of the death penalty and spoke disparagingly of gay marriage, which was legalised in France in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He publicly defended the far-right National Front and telephoned its founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, an old friend, to congratulate him when the party did well in local elections in 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's lovers included Schneider and German model-turned-singer Nico, with whom he had a son. In 1964, he married Nathalie Barthelemy and fathered a second son before ending the marriage and embarking on a 15-year relationship with Mireille Darc. He had two more children with Dutch model Rosalie van Breemen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a January 2018 interview, Delon told Paris Match he was fed up with modern life and had a chapel and tomb ready for him on the grounds of his home near Geneva, and for his Belgian shepherd dog, called Loubo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I die before him I'll ask the vet to let us go together. He will give the dog an injection so he can die in my arms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's last major public appearance was to receive an honorary Palme d'or at the Cannes film festival in May 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his last years, Delon was the centre of a family feud over his care, which made headlines in French media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April 2024 a judge placed Delon under "reinforced curatorship", meaning he no longer had full freedom to manage his assets. He was already under legal protection over concerns over his health and well-being. (Reuters)

 Former chief executive CY Leung said on Sunday he hopes more young people can join the country's global charitable drive, saying Hongkongers have an advantage in such work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the GX Foundation, which he set up six years ago, has been helping seven countries in three different continents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes performing surgery for some 15,000 cataract patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's now a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said when he visited those places, the conditions reminded him of China's past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I go around these places, I see situations worse than how our country was some 40-plus years ago. The medical and public health conditions were rather bad," Leung spoke on a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we utilise the strength of our Chinese community and provide help, do something. And we've got some good results. Such initiatives also help to connect Chinese and overseas peoples."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charity now plans to provide water filtering services to needy countries, on top of educating young people about the Belt and Road Initiative and public health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hongkongers have unique advantages in joining these charitable drives for China, such as the convenience of visa-free travel with an SAR passport, and the city's role as a global aviation and logistics hub.

    URA hits back at homeowners over maintenance needs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wai Chi-sing said it is wrong for homeowners to think that they should no longer pay for maintenance works after their
buildings have been earmarked for redevelopment. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766630_1_20240818124905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority on Sunday criticised homeowners who complained about their buildings being earmarked for redevelopment just after they had started maintenance work on their buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statutory body's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, said it is wrong to think that it is a waste of money to repair dilapidated structures, saying it is a matter of public safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the URA announced redevelopment plans for a tenement block in To Kwa Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The building, which is more than half a century old, was already undergoing repair works with scaffolding erected across the facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The media cited  flat owners as saying that they'd rather not continue with the rest of the works - now that their block would most likely be knocked down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Wai reminded owners it takes quite a long time for a redevelopment project to be completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's a maintenance need for buildings earmarked in renewal plans, or they have received mandatory inspection or repair orders from the government, the homeowners really should not delay the procedures and think that they can just wait for the URA's acquisition," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because in the event that during the wait, a lack of repairs leads to an accident that causes injury or even death, it is possible homeowners will have to shoulder relevant legal responsibilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said if homeowners kept relevant records and receipts for the maintenance works, they would be able to apply for ex gratia reimbursements from the URA after they accept an acquisition offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He explained that redevelopment projects must be kept confidential before their launch, because they involve acquisition and compensation.

    Thai king formally appoints Paetongtarn Shinawatra

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paetongtarn is the third Shinawatra to be prime minister. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766631_1_20240818125558.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Thai king on Sunday formally appointed Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 37-year-old daughter of controversial billionaire ex-premier Thaksin, as Thailand's new prime minister.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn, the kingdom's youngest ever PM, comes to office after a court sacked the previous premier and disbanded the main opposition party, throwing Thailand's ever-febrile political scene into a new round of turmoil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is the third Shinawatra to be prime minister, but will hope to avoid the fate of her father and aunt Yingluck, both of whom were thrown out of power in military coups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn received King Maha Vajiralongkorn's official written command to form a government in a ceremony at the headquarters of a former pro-Thaksin TV station soon after 9:30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called on all Thais to work together to help revitalise the country's sluggish economy, which has struggled to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As head of the government I will work with parliament with an open heart, open to all ideas to help develop the country," she said after the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fellow Thais, this duty cannot be done by the prime minister alone. I hope I will be able to coordinate the power of all generations, all talented people in Thailand -- from the cabinet, the coalition, civil servants, private sector and the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, 75, was a prominent attendee at the ceremony, standing alongside Paetongtarn's husband in the front row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has to work hard. Her strong point is that she is young, she can ask anyone for help -- she is humble," Thaksin told reporters after the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Twenty-three years ago she was standing behind my back but today I was standing behind her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn heads a coalition government led by her Pheu Thai party -- the latest incarnation of the political movement founded by her father in the early 2000s -- but including some pro-military groups long opposed to Thaksin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her elevation to the top job came about after the kingdom's Constitutional Court sacked previous premier Srettha Thavisin on Wednesday for breaching ethics rules by appointing a cabinet minister with a criminal conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand has been dominated for more than 20 years by a tussle for dominance between Thaksin and his allies and the kingdom's conservative pro-military, pro-royalist elite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties linked to the former telecoms tycoon and one-time Manchester City owner have repeatedly won elections, only to find their governments upended by coups and court rulings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is a relative newcomer, running the hotel arm of the family business until late 2022 when she entered politics ahead of last year's general election where Pheu Thai was unexpectedly beaten into second place by the upstart progressive Move Forward Party (MFP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite winning most seats in last year's election, MFP was blocked from forming a government by conservative junta-appointed senators spooked by its promise to reform royal insult laws and break up powerful business monopolies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That allowed Pheu Thai to strike an uneasy coalition deal with pro-military parties once staunchly opposed to Thaksin and his followers, leading to Srettha's ascension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a year later, he became the third prime minister from a Thaksin-backed party to be kicked out by the Constitutional Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn will be watched closely for signs of influence exerted by her father, who is the most influential but controversial politician in modern Thai history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked Sunday if he would take an official role as her advisor, Thaksin said: "Not neccessary. I am old. I am 75 years old, She can ask me anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He transformed the kingdom's politics in the early 2000s with populist policies that won him and his party enduring loyalty from the rural masses -- and two election victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that success came at a cost: he was despised by Thailand's powerful elites and conservative establishment, who saw his rule as corrupt, authoritarian and socially destabilising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ousted as prime minister by the army in 2006, Thaksin went into exile two years later but never stopped commenting on national affairs -- or meddling in them, according to his critics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned last year on the day Srettha became PM, and was immediately jailed on graft and abuse of office charges dating back to his time in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his eight-year sentence was quickly cut to one year by the king, and he was then soon granted parole because of his age and poor health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday he was granted a royal pardon, making him a free man two weeks before his parole was due to end. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A search is continuing on Lantau Island for two stray dogs who were allegedly abused by workers of the Po Lin Monastery last Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police confirmed they have arrested two men, aged 65 and 46, on suspicion of animal abuse yesterday. Both have been granted bail pending an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, who worked as chefs at the Buddhist institution, allegedly removed the canines from the quarters, before setting them free at a remote location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monastery said it has arranged staff to look for the stay dogs near Sham Wat Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement online, it said "the monastery has always been kind to stray dogs around Ngong Ping, providing them a shelter, arranging sterilisation, vaccination and basic medical treatment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprawling monastery on Ngong Ping is home to the Big Buddha, one of the main tourist attractions of Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD on Saturday announced plans to open a car production plant in Pakistan, where it will also start selling three models through a partnership with Mega Motors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BYD is the first major new electric vehicle entrant in the Pakistani market, where there is a lack of charging infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entry into the Pakistani market is not just about bringing advanced vehicles to consumers," said Liu Xueliang, BYD's general manager for Asia Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about driving a broader vision of environmental responsibility and technological innovation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD also plans to open three "flagship stores and experience centres" in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, the company said at a launch event in Lahore, adding it plans to start selling two SUV models and a sedan from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mega Motors is a unit of Pakistan's largest private utility Hub Power Co Ltd, known as Hubco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will establish Pakistan's first NEV assembly plant... dedicated to producing BYD's cutting-edge new energy vehicles," said Hubco Chief Executive Kamran Kamal, who described the deal as a "landmark investment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new plant will begin operations in 2026, Kamal told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hubco will setup fast-charging stations across major cities, motorways and highways to enhance Pakistan's charging infrastructure. (Reuters)

 The Observatory on Sunday cancelled the Amber Rainstorm Warning at 9 am, after it had been in place for about three hours.

  <br/>
  It is the second day in a row that the Observatory has issued the amber warning, as Hong Kong continues to be hit by heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government called on members of the public to report any flooding and warned employers, contractors and workers to be aware of electrical safety at work.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maria Corina Machado stands on a truck in Caracas to address her supporters. Machado has called for mass gatherings in more than 300 cities in Venezuela and abroad. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766603_1_20240818022148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has mostly been in hiding since July 28 presidential polls, led a "Protest for the Truth" in Caracas on Saturday against Nicolas Maduro's disputed claim of having won reelection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atop an opposition campaign truck, and surrounded by motorcyclists and cars waving the national flag, she joined hundreds of supporters gathered in the capital in response to her call for mass gatherings in more than 300 cities in Venezuela and abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Machado had called for the anti-Maduro movement to "remain firm and united" in the face of threats and violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're trying to scare us, to divide us, to paralyze us, to demoralize us, but they can't because they are absolutely entrenched in their lies (and) violence," she wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many protesters waved printed copies of election records from their voting stations, which they say prove the opposition won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) proclaimed Maduro the winner of a third six-year term until 2031, giving him 52 percent of votes cast on July 28 but without providing a detailed breakdown of the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition says polling-station-level results show its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia took more than two-thirds of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia replaced Machado on the ballot after she was ruled out of running by institutions loyal to the regime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we keep quiet, this makes no sense," said demonstrator Adriana Calzadilla, a 55-year-old teacher in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a criminal government that wants to hold on to power. I smell freedom, I have nothing to fear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-Maduro protests have claimed 25 lives so far, with nearly 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested since election day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early on Saturday, a heavy security presence took shape in the capital, with two armoured vehicles and 40 motorcycle-mounted troops controlling access to the low-income Petare neighborhood, a few miles from the opposition's gathering point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media reported similar deployments in other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one of the first overseas demonstrations to get under way Saturday, more than 100 Venezuelans in Australia rallied in Sydney, waving national flags and balloons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a strong message to our people in Venezuela. We are with you, and we want the world to listen what we are saying," said protest organizer Rina Rivas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear if Gonzalez Urrutia, also in hiding, will attend Saturday's march. He last appeared in public at a protest on July 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro had called for Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia to be arrested. He accuses them of seeking to foment a "coup d'etat." (AFP)

    Liverpool brush aside Ipswich, Arsenal beat Wolves

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Liverpool manager Arne Slot and first team individual development coach Aaron Briggs watch the game. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766596_1_20240817223239.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot got off to a winning start as Liverpool manager with a 2-0 win at newly-promoted Ipswich on Saturday as Arsenal began their Premier League title challenge by beating Wolves by the same scoreline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newcastle defied an early red card for Fabian Schar to edge past Southampton 1-0, while Brighton ran riot under new manager Fabian Hurzeler in a 3-0 victory at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot has huge shoes to fill at Anfield after the departure of Jurgen Klopp, who restored the Reds to the top of the English game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman was left less than impressed by his side's first 45 minutes at Portman Road as Ipswich flew out of the traps on their return to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Liverpool were a different side after the break as goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah barely reflected their dominance to get Slot off to the perfect start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We as a team made a big change at half-time because we came out totally different to how we had come out in the first half," said the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second half, we won more duels, we won more second balls and we played more balls in behind because if the other team takes the risk of playing one-v-one and you have the likes of Luis Diaz, Mo Salah and Diogo Jota then use them, play the balls in behind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have finished second to Manchester City in each of the past two seasons and are highly-fancied to be the champions' closest challengers again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kai Havertz opened the scoring at the Emirates from Bukayo Saka's cross to reward the Gunners' early dominance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men needed a vital save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen and Matheus Cunha missed a huge chance to level before Arsenal made the points safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The roles from the first goal were reversed as this time Havertz teed up Saka to lash home.

  <br/>
  Newcastle's hopes of a winning start to the season looked to have been undone when Schar was sent off after just 28 minutes for what the referee deemed a headbutt on Ben Brereton Diaz despite limited contact between the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton had dominated even the early exchanges against the Magpies' full compliment but failed to convert from 19 shots and nearly 80 percent possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Newcastle were clinical as Alexander Isak teed up Joelinton for the only goal just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's final season at Goodison Park got off to a nightmare start as 31-year-old Hurzeler enjoyed a dream start to life in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaoru Mitoma fired Brighton in front on his return from injury that saw the Japanese international miss much of last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Welbeck added a second after the break before Everton were reduced to 10 men when Ashley Young saw red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Adingra made it 3-0 late on and only a VAR review denied Brighton a fourth through Yasin Ayari.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Semenyo stepped into the void left at Bournemouth by the departure of Dominic Solanke with a late equaliser to salvage a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest.

  City begin their defence of the title in the standout fixture of the weekend at Chelsea on Sunday.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Infectious diseases expert Professor Ivan Hung says the chances of the mpox virus spreading to Hong Kong is very low. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766586_1_20240817180654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Saturday were told not to panic about the more deadly and transmissible clade 1b strain of the mpox virus, but those belonging to the high-risk groups, should stay vigilant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advice from infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung came after the World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency - the highest level of alarm that can be issued by the world body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox were reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in a single week, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit country, the Democratic Republic of Congo has reported 222 confirmed and 783 suspected cases, as well as 24 deaths in one week, the African union health agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Hung told RTHK that the chance of the virus spreading to the SAR was very low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he urged those belonging to high-risk groups - such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, bisexuals, and laboratory workers - to get vaccinated and watch out for symptoms. They include a rash, a fever, coughing, and a stuffy nose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But important, of course, is that you have to take extra precaution if you belong to the high-risk groups and also those who are immunocompromised, then of course you should be cautious and consider taking the vaccines,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong professor also urged people to avoid travelling to high-risk areas in Africa, and not to touch wild animals so as to reduce the risk of catching the viral disease. (with additional reporting by AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New Zealand’s Ardie Savea is tackled during the match in Auckland. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766577_1_20240817171721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand thumped Argentina 42-10 on Saturday as Will Jordan grabbed two of their six tries in The Rugby Championship to avenge last week's shock defeat by the Pumas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Damian McKenzie scored 17 points in Auckland as the All Blacks defied wet conditions in a skilled attacking display to maintain their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was vast improvement on the 38-30 loss in Wellington last week, with an explosive first-half performance pushing the hosts 35-3 ahead through five converted tries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was built on a dominant display from the forwards, who heeded the call for "redemption" issued to them by coach Scott Robertson after they were outplayed a week earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina's scrum was overpowered and they weren't the same force at the breakdown in a performance punctuated by mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their lone try came late in the match to fullback Juan Cruz Mallia, meaning the second half was drawn 7-7, helped by tighter defence from the visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was New Zealand's best performance under first-year coach Robertson in his fifth match in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory continued New Zealand's remarkable record in Auckland, where they've won 50 Tests since their last defeat, against France in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed all his six conversion attempts and his general play was superior to the first Test, mixing an astute long kicking game with some clever chips to counter the Pumas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The playmaker also opened the scoring with a try after pouncing on a chip from Jordie Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santiago Carreras responded with a Pumas penalty goal before New Zealand captain Ardie Savea powered over for his 27th Test try -- lifting him level with former skipper Richie McCaw for the most by an All Blacks forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Caleb Clarke and Jordan were both put into space for tries -- the latter capitalising on a blindside break from scrum-half TJ Perenara.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie's sweetly timed pass put Beauden Barrett across just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan continued the rout soon after the break, lifting him to 33 tries in as many Tests in his first starting appearance since last year's World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game entered a lull before Mallia's try and a late yellow card was shown to All Blacks hooker Asafo Aumua for a high tackle. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tobacco and Control Office on Saturday said it launched a crackdown on the smoking of waterpipes, also known as shishas or hookahs, in Tsim Sha Tui on Friday night, issuing 11 fixed penalty notices at one bar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers including those in plain clothes raided the bar, handing out the notices which carry a penalty of HK$1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also said the bar's operators may be prosecuted under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance, and for aiding and abetting smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tobacco and Control Office spokesman said due to deeper inhalation a waterpipe smoker usually inhales more toxins and that a typical one-hour session exposes the user to 100-to-200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also flagged the carbon monoxide poisoning risk of charcoal burning and the unhygienic smoking apparatus

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A typhoon that blasted parts of Japan with more than 200-kilometre-per-hour winds moved out to sea on Saturday, mostly sparing the capital and allowing trains and some flights to resume.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tokyo and its surrounding areas had been on high alert on Friday for Ampil's approach, with transport services, trips, events and school classes cancelled en masse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm was packing gusts of 216 kilometres per hour on Saturday morning when it veered away from the archipelago and headed northeast into the Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, the Japan Meteorological Agency warned that "some areas in the northern part of Japan are experiencing heavy rain due to warm, humid air around the typhoon".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please be advised that the risk of landslides has been significantly elevated by the heavy rain so far in some areas", the weather agency said in an advisory on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although a severe hit on Tokyo never came, some minor injuries and damage were reported, including broken windows, toppled trees and broken utility poles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most parts of Japan's bullet train network went back to normal on Saturday after the Central Japan Railway Company closed a busy section between Tokyo and Nagoya the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "JR Central bullet trains are business as usual today," the railway firm said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airlines were still being affected to a degree, with broadcaster NHK saying All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines had together scrapped 68 flights as of Saturday morning, after hundreds of cancellations the day before. (AFP)

    Sports Institute head defends athlete sponsorship

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) chief executive Tony Choi says the institute provides the city's athletes with an overall package, which includes some financial sponsorship, but athletes are not its employees.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments come after Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary general of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, said local athletes didn't have a need to spend much as they were allocated with accommodation, training, and medical support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But online criticism continued following the SAR's success at the Paris Olympics, with athletes chiming in and saying they had to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Choi said entry-level full-time athletes get around HK$7,000 a month, so they could focus on training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSI and the athlete are not employer and employee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But also we are including overseas training, local training, coaching support, accommodation, meals, and also education support. It's an overall package for the elite athletes... They are not our staff."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi denied that the limited subsidy provided had led to potential athletes dropping out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see many athletes dropping out... We tried our best to help, in terms of other expenses, which included study, career planning. We hope to give athletes motivation... If many potential athletes dropped out, Hong Kong wouldn't have achieved good results," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi added that "only the fittest will survive", and resources given to athletes were inevitably hinged on their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-chairman of the HKSI, Vincent Cheng, said a review on a direct subsidy scheme for local athletes will be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have to review every four years. We're going to have this review starting from September and October, and hopefully we can finish it earlier next year. We will review... especially on their subsidy support," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong saw heavy rain on Saturday morning with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning for about five-and-a-half hours until just before 11 am. There were no reports of any damage, although there was some flooding in Ma On Shan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government put out a call for the public to report any flooding and for employers, contractors, and employees to be aware of electrical safety at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rainfall comes less than a day after the Drainage Services Department outlined seven projects to cope with the increasingly frequent extreme weather conditions, with the Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok signing five contracts relating to the projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new projects follow the extreme rainstorms last September and a commitment to implement them by the Chief Executive John Lee in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include six underground flood storage tanks in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City, Shek Kip Mei, Sha Tin, Tai Po, and Kwun Tong along with drainage improvement works in those districts and in Eastern District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage tanks, which have a total capacity of more than 200,000 cubic metres, will be at Shek Kip Mei Park, Morse Park, Hoi Bun Road Park, Argyle Street Playground, Tai Po Old Market Playground, and Sha Tin Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work will be completed in phases over the next three-and-a-half years to six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five contracts signed on Friday totalled HK$6.4 billion.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joshua Zirkzee made himself a Manchester United hero on his debut with a late winner to beat Fulham 1-0 in the opening match of the Premier League season on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, lacking match fitness after his move from Bologna last month, came on only for the final half hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch international saved the Red Devils from a frustrating evening at Old Trafford when he poked in Alejandro Garnacho's cross on 87 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better," said Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been told (scoring at the Stretford End) is one of the best feelings at Manchester United. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United boss Erik ten Hag survived at the end of last season, despite finishing eighth in the Premier League, thanks to winning the FA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether that shock victory over rivals and English champions Manchester City in May could be a springboard remains to be seen after a performance that was eerily reminiscent of many last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said on the eve of the game that his side were "not ready" for the new campaign with key players missing through injury or a lack of match fitness, and it showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Fernandes started in a centre-forward role in the absence of Rasmus Hojlund, while Zirkzee was on the bench after returning to pre-season late following Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noussair Mazraoui was thrown straight into the starting line-up at left-back after joining from Bayern Munich this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was no place in the squad for Jadon Sancho even though the winger and Ten Hag appeared to have settled their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fulham won at Old Trafford last season for the first time in 20 years in February during a torrid campaign for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little seemed to have changed in the opening 20 minutes as the visitors started confidently and Andre Onana did well to prevent Kenny Tete's dipping effort finding the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fulham were nearly masters of their own downfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro pounced on Bernd Leno's sloppy pass and teed up Fernandes, who could only fire straight at Fulham's German goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro's struggles played a large part in United's problems last season, but the Brazilian started the new campaign more like his old self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An incisive through ball from the former Real Madrid midfielder created another brilliant chance for Fernandes, who again could not beat Leno from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's lack of a predatory striker continued to haunt them after the break as Leno spread himself brilliantly to this time deny Mason Mount a rare goal since his move from Chelsea just over a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag turned to Garnacho and Zirkzee from the bench in the search of a winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In doing so United left themselves open and Fulham could have secured another famous three points at the Theatre of Dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreas Pereira's poor pass cost Alex Iwobi the chance to run clean through on goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later Lisandro Martinez produced a goal-saving clearance from Pereira's dangerous low cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was the home side that snatched all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho's ball from the right was not the best, but Zirkzee managed to get a toe on it to divert it beyond Leno into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United should have had a second in stoppage time when Garnacho somehow skewed wide with an open goal to aim at from Marcus Rashford's unselfish pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But United held on to give Ten Hag the winning start he badly needed. (AFP)

    Harris woos middle classes with economic package

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, has promised to champion an "opportunity economy," and build up the middle class. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766526_1_20240817044608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris unveiled an economic blueprint on Friday heavy on popular measures to cut costs for Americans, while attacking powerful companies for price gouging, as she fleshed out her election platform ahead of the Democratic National Convention.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The speech in North Carolina -- a vital battleground state -- was the first time Harris, who jumped into the race against Donald Trump less than a month ago, laid out a vision for combating the inflation which soured voters on her boss President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promising to champion an "opportunity economy," she said "building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an effort to connect with voters angry at Biden, Harris recounted her modest background, noting that she'd worked in a McDonald's during university studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And she acknowledged that while "by any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world..., many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking a leaf from Trump's populist playbook, she threw out the idea of hefty tax breaks for families with children, help in accessing government-subsidized health care, and support for first-time homebuyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This came on top of an announcement Thursday that the White House has negotiated reduced prices for retirees purchasing common medicines from major drug manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also called on Congress to pass a first federal ban on so-called "price-gouging" by food companies that unfairly increase prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the convention starting in Chicago on Monday, the proposals were meant to flesh out a come-from-behind campaign that has seen Harris spark huge enthusiasm in the Democratic Party, but offer little detail on how she'd govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice president, vying to become the first woman president, hopes the headline-grabbing proposals will distance her from Biden's unpopular management of price surges that hit ordinary Americans in the wake of the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump and the Republicans are trying to tie Harris to 81-year-old Biden, who abruptly dropped his re-election bid on July 21 and endorsed his vice president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kamala Harris has had three-and-a-half years in office and all she's done is break the economy. Kamala can't shake the stench of Bidenomics," the Trump campaign said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trump campaign referred to an "inflation nightmare for American families" and claimed "Harris's vision is a Soviet-style communism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In reality, inflation is on a steady downward trend, while the US economy has avoided a much-feared recession, with strong job growth and record stock markets. However, the lingering effects from the Covid-related upheaval continue to be felt for regular consumers, ranging from prices on some food items to high interest rates for home buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What's not yet clear is how the generous Harris tax breaks would be paid for. The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that Harris's measures would cost more than US$1.7 trillion over the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, has mirrored some of Trump's populist strategy, including a proposal to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Harris is drawing a contrast with 78-year-old Trump's economic vision, painting him as being pro-millionaires and risking sharply increased costs for Americans through his proposal to slap tariffs of 10-20 percent on global imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations... I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans," Harris said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off an early slump to close higher on Friday, ending a positive week for the major indices on Wall Street, as gold prices hit a record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We had very big moves over the past two weeks, off the low," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments. "And now we are only five percent below the all time high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That shows us that there is still a lot of demand for stocks at lower prices," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.2 percent at 40,659.76, the S&P 500 finished 0.2 percent higher at 5,554.25 and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.2 percent higher at 17,631.72.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold hit a new record on Friday as investors snapped up the precious metal amid increasing confidence that US rates will fall in September, weakening the US dollar. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also increased market appetite for safe haven investments like gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders are now looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes of its most recent interest rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also be closely scrutinizing comments from Fed officials around the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers next weekend, according to Sarhan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have expectations that the Fed is going to cut, the question now becomes how many times they will cut," he said. "Nobody knows, not even the Fed. It's data dependent once again." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kyiv said on Friday its incursion into Russian territory had advanced, claiming it aimed to force Russia to negotiate on "fair" terms, as Moscow's troops announced new gains in eastern Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv's troops last week launched a major counter-offensive into Russia's Kursk region, sending more than 120,000 people fleeing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the Ukrainian military Oleksandr Syrsky told President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday that "the troops continue to fight and have advanced in some areas from one to three kilometres (0.6 to 1.8 miles) towards the enemy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said in his evening address: "We see that the occupier is suffering losses, and this is useful, very useful for our defence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky's aide Mykhailo Podolyak said earlier Friday that Ukraine wanted to negotiate "on our own terms" by inflicting "significant tactical defeats on Russia".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have absolutely no plans to beg: 'Please, sit down to negotiate', he wrote on X, saying that Kyiv in the Kursk region is using military means to "persuade Russia to enter a fair negotiation process".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Vladimir Putin has said Russia would declare a ceasefire only if Kyiv withdraws from the four regions that Russia claims to have annexed but only partially controls -- Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine meanwhile claims to have seized more than 1,100 square kilometres of Russian territory, in the biggest attack by a foreign army on Russian soil since World War II. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gold hit a record high on Friday as global stock markets diverged, with profit-taking on Wall Street while European and Asian markets gained on reassuring data about the health of the world's biggest economy and likely US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Expectations of US interest rate cuts weakened the dollar, while oil prices tumbled as weak Chinese demand expectations offset turmoil in the Middle East, according to traders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold rose to a record high of US$2,500.16 an ounce as investors snapped up the haven investment in the face of an increasingly likely US interest rate cut in September and heightened geopolitical risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sharp drop in bond yields amid expectations of rate cuts by the Fed" have pushed gold prices higher, said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's major indices dipped at the start of trading after rallying on Thursday following stronger-than-expected retail sales data that dispelled fears the US economy is heading for a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These aren't big moves at all relative to the gains that have preceded them, yet buyers aren't rushing in to buy the dip just yet knowing the market has come a long way in a short amount of time," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the S&P 500 is up more than eight percent from its August 5 low and the Nasdaq Composite has gained 12 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices slumped more than 1.5 percent, Brent North Sea crude falling under US$80 per barrel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The significant price recovery on the oil market has run out of steam in recent days," said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For one thing, the feared retaliatory strike by Iran (on Israel) has so far failed to materialise, which has probably favoured a partial pricing out of the risk premium. In addition, new demand concerns are weighing on the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major oil producer Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for last month's killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. (AFP)

    We will ensure panda cubs' survival: Ocean Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Friday said it is sparing no effort to ensure the survival of the newborn giant panda twins in Hong Kong, with experts keeping a watchful eye on the cubs around the clock.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing a day after their birth, the park reassured that the twins' survival rate is higher in captivity, compared to those born in the wild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Howard Chuk, the head of Zoological Operations and Conservation at Ocean Park, noted that experts from the mainland are also playing a role in ensuring the baby pandas’ survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the cubs are actually being handled by the experts from Wolong [National Nature Reserve]. We make sure the cubs could [reach] a more stable status," he said, adding that they hope the mother panda, Ying Ying, can raise them later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, we do hope that Ying Ying can learn it and experience it, and not jeopardise her welfare management."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying gave birth to the twins on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Ocean Park's chairman, Paulo Pong, confirmed that the new cubs will stay in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Luckily at the same time we're actually receiving two new pandas. So it's perhaps the double gold from the Olympics, perhaps it's the double bronze from the Olympics that gave us even more luck," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope this will bring great fortune to Hong Kong and we hope to continue our journey in our works of conservation and education," Pong added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Friday said he expects the public could meet the two new giant pandas gifted by the central authorities in December.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Yeung visited Sichuan where he attended a cooperation agreement signing ceremony on the arrival arrangements for the two giant pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up his visit, he said the two giant pandas are expected to arrive in the SAR by late September. But he said the pair would have to undergo one month of quarantine and that they would need another month to adapt to their new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that Ocean Park may need new facilities to accommodate giant pandas, as the city's panda Ying Ying gave birth to two cubs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, in the future, may have six giant pandas... Newborn giant panda babies can live in the same environment with their mum until they are two to three years old," he told reporters at the airport here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still have time. In the next one or two years, we can plan for long-term arrangements regarding the living environment of the six giant pandas."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the two newborn giant pandas are currently in a stable condition, and that the twins would continue to stay in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Newborn giant pandas need special care because of their small size, such as in terms of their body temperature or how they take in milk," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But people don't have to worry about that. Experts from the mainland and Ocean Park are closely monitoring their situation. We are providing the most professional and the best care for the cubs."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's job market remained steady, with the latest government data showing the unemployment rate at three percent between May and July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure has been unchanged since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a government spokesperson warned the labour market could be under pressure in the short term, as changing spending habits of locals and visitors would dent consumption-related industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the jobless rate remained consistent, around 3,100 people still lost their jobs in July, joining more than 114,000 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, the labour force expanded by 8,400 to roughly 3.83 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weak domestic demand continued to weigh on consumption-related industries. The jobless rate for the retail sector worsened by 0.4 percent to 4.3 percent, while food and beverage industry hit five percent after going up three-tenths of a percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other sectors improved, notably trade and wholesale, accommodation services, transportation, insurance sector and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market "should remain tight in the near term", according to labour and welfare minister Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Statistics from the Labour Department suggest job hunters have much less choice. There were around 71,700 private-sector vacancies in July, a 31 percent decline from a year ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the three-month period ending in June, according to revised figures released by the government on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth followed a 2.8 percent increase in GDP in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, government economist Adolph Leung said he expects the economy to continue to expand, driven by strong export demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year. Exports of goods should sustain a positive performance if external demand holds up, though trade conflicts would present risks,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials kept this year's projected economic growth unchanged at 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It downgraded the projected inflation rate from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent for the year.

    China backs Myanmar's democratic transition: Wang Yi

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi shakes hand with Eksiri Pintaruchi, Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Thailand, during the 9th Mekong-Lancang Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Chiang Mai. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766452_1_20240816163414.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China supports a plan by Myanmar's military government to hold fresh elections and return the country to a "democratic transition".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Thailand to attend a regional meeting, Wang said that China also supports a peace plan agreed to by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), known as its five-point "consensus".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We support Myanmar in achieving domestic political reconciliation within the framework of its constitution... and restarting the process of democratic transition through elections," the foreign minister said at the meeting in Chiang Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country has been in turmoil ever since the military deposed the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coup upended a 10-year experiment with democracy and a subsequent military crackdown has sparked fighting with established ethnic minority armed groups and newer pro-democracy "People's Defence Forces".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is an ally of the military government, but analysts say it also maintains ties with ethnic groups fighting the military in Myanmar's northern Shan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar's government has promised to hold fresh elections but has repeatedly delayed a timetable for polls as it struggles to crush opposition to its coup across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week Wang met military chief Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw and "discussed and exchanged views openly regarding free and fair multi-party general elections".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar is deeply divided by conflict, with civilians caught up in near-daily bomb blasts, targeted killings and clashes between the military and opponents of its coup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has acknowledged it does not fully control swathes of the country and in February activated a long-dormant conscription law to replenish its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has said it will hold polls next year after conducting a nationwide census. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

    Thaksin's daughter becomes new Thai PM

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766441_1_20240816132529.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paetongtarn Shinawatra won the backing of parliament to become Thailand's youngest prime minister on Friday, only a day after she was thrust into the spotlight amid an unrelenting power struggle between the warring elites.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old daughter of divisive political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra won easily with 319 votes, or nearly two-thirds of the house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was not present in parliament and watched the vote from her Pheu Thai Party's headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn now faces a baptism of fire, just two days after ally Srettha Thavisin was dismissed as premier by a judiciary central to Thailand's two decades of intermittent turmoil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At stake could be the legacy and political future of the billionaire Shinawatra family, whose once unstoppable populist juggernaut suffered its first election defeat in over two decades last year, and had to do a deal with its bitter enemies in the military to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn will immediately face challenges on multiple fronts, with the economy floundering and the popularity of her Pheu Thai Party dwindling, having yet to deliver on its flagship cash handout programme worth 500 billion baht.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn has never served in government and will become Thailand's second female prime minister and the third Shinawatra to take the top job after aunt Yingluck Shinawatra, and 75-year-old father Thaksin, the country's most influential and polarising politician. (Reuters)

    China to screen arrivals for mpox symptoms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China announced on Friday it would begin screening people and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, just two days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global health emergency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People travelling from countries where virus outbreaks have occurred, who have been in contact with mpox cases or display symptoms, should "take the initiative to declare to customs when entering the country", China's customs administration said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vehicles, containers and items from areas with mpox cases should also be sanitised, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden on Thursday announced the first case outside Africa of a more dangerous variant of mpox, with the WHO warning that further imported cases of this new strain in Europe was likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO on Wednesday had sounded its highest possible alarm over the worsening mpox situation in Africa, calling it a global public health emergency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just a day before, the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the intensifying outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox has swept through the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970, and spread to other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals, but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions. (AFP)

    'Raygun' hits back at critics of her Olympic routine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael Gunn said the backlash to her much-ridiculed Olympic performance has been “devastating,” adding she took the competition seriously and gave her best effort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old b-girl, known as "Raygun", said in a video posted to social media that she wasn’t prepared for the level of negative attention she has received since judges awarded her zero points in her Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) criticised an anonymous online petition attacking the Paris Games competitor, saying it was “vexatious, misleading and bullying.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympic debut in Paris, and one of the lasting images was the performance of Gunn, a 36-year-old university professor from Sydney — who did a “kangaroo dance” among other questionable moves during her routine — and did not receive a single point from any of the nine judges in either round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn was subsequently mocked for her efforts, including a parody on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in the United States. In the video, she said she was subjected to abuse that went beyond criticism of her dance moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’d really like to ask the press to please stop harassing my family, my friends, the Australian breaking community and the broader street dance community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn, who has not yet returned to Australia, received strong support from Australian Olympic team leader Anna Meares while in Paris. On Thursday, the AOC went a step further, taking aim at what it called erroneous material published online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief executive officer Matt Carroll said the the AOC had written to Change.org, which had published a petition criticising Gunn and the AOC, demanding that it be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 people had signed the petition claiming Gunn had “manipulated” Olympic qualification processes. The petition appeared to have been removed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carroll said the petition “contained numerous falsehoods designed to engender hatred against an athlete who was selected in the Australian Olympic team through a transparent and independent qualification event and nomination process.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking at the Olympics might have been one-and-done in Paris. The sport is not on the competition list for Los Angeles in 2028, and also is unlikely to appear in 2032 at Brisbane, Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online criticism of Gunn this past week has included suggestions the Oceania qualifying event held in Sydney last October was set up to favour her, and questioned the judging that allowed Gunn to qualify .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AOC said Thursday the Oceania qualifying event was conducted under the Olympic qualification system determined by the international governing body, the World DanceSport Federation, and approved by International Olympic Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unattributed social media comments also suggested Gunn and her husband, fellow breaker Samuel Free, had held positions within Australian breaking organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Rachael Gunn holds no position with AUSBreaking or DanceSport Australia in any capacity,” the AOC said Thursday. “She is simply an athlete who competed in the qualifying event which she won.” (AP)

 Immigration officials on Friday said they had arrested three people on suspicion of working illegally in the SAR as photographers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department said it believes the trio – a man and two women – had advertised wedding and street photography services on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they pretended to be customers and arrested the three suspects after they entered Hong Kong from the mainland as tourists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea broke a century-old weather record with the 26th so-called tropical night in a row -- when the temperature stays above 25 degrees Celsius, according to official data released Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Much of the world is enduring a summer of extreme heat, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning last month of an "extreme heat epidemic", and calling for action to limit the impact of heatwaves intensified by climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight temperatures in the South Korean capital Seoul have sizzled above 25 degrees Celsius for 26 days in a row, officials said, marking the longest streak since modern weather observation began in 1907.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record ties a streak set in 2018, but the weather agency counts the most recent as the benchmark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The intense heat in Seoul is expected to continue, according to Seoul's Office of Metrology, setting a new record every day until next week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck 34 kilometres off Taiwan's eastern city of Hualien on Friday, with no immediate reports of damage from what was the second strong tremor to hit the island in less than a day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The quake also shook buildings in Taipei. Authorities said subway services in the city continued at lower speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quake had a depth of 9.7 kilometres, the weather administration said, and followed a 5.7 magnitude earthquake that struck off Taiwan's northeastern shore on late Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather officials have warned of the risk of landslides in mountainous areas following days of rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, Hualien was hit by the biggest earthquake to affect the island in at least 25 years. Nine people were killed and more than 900 injured. (Reuters)

    Make HK a hard liquor trading centre, says lawmaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB's Kennedy Wong said if Hong Kong didn't lower or scrap hard liquor duty, it would lose out to Hainan Island and Macau. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766395_1_20240816093031.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong says Hong Kong should scrap its 100 percent levy on strong alcohol so it can match the wine industry and become an international trading centre for hard liquor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Wong said the wine trade had boomed since duty was scrapped in 2008 and revenue from sales of alcohol with a strength of over 30 percent was only HK$700 million. He also said Hong Kong needs to compete with Hainan, which will be tax free by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look at this issue from a trade perspective. If we don't lower or scrap the duty we are already losing out to Macau and the surrounding areas and at the end of this year, when Hainan turns into a free trade zone, a lot of the whisky, brandy promotions - because they are all aimed at the mainland China market - they'll all move to Hainan. Hard liquor from mainland China, like the Moutai, the Wuliangyee, they won't use Hong Kong to tap the international market, they might as well use Hainan," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong had the highest liquor duty in the region with Macau only charging 10 percent. He said Hong Kong also charged more than Taiwan and Japan, although the duty here was about the same as South Korea. He said Hainan, which caters mainly to the mainland domestic tourist market, had been declared a tax free area by the State Council in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said if Hong Kong followed the same route as the wine trade here, it could be an attractive place for companies wanting to sell top-of-the range hard liquor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You scrapped the duty so a lot of aged or vintage wine moved to Hong Kong and because Hong Kong also had first-class storage facilities - and because of our close proximity to the mainland China market, which is a big, big market you know for the wine industry - a lot of wine merchants created off-shoots here including a lot of French vineyards, chateaux that I know," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think likewise for liquor: for vodka, for whisky, for brandy, for the Moutai and so on. If they all create more trading companies here and then they are willing to move some of their vintage - the nice liquor - to Hong Kong, then Hong Kong will gradually climb back to the top of the world in this particular field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month the DAB called on the Chief Executive John Lee to scrap the duty on hard liquor as part of its proposals for Lee's upcoming policy address.

 Hungary's Blanka Vas won the fifth stage of the Tour de France Femmes on Thursday with Dutch teammate Demi Vollering losing the race lead after being caught up in a big crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma finished second to take the leader's yellow jersey from defending champion Vollering who dropped to ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pile-up with six kilometres to go involving 10 riders including Vollering decimated the peloton in the run to Amneville in northeastern France.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly agreed terms to become the new coach of the United States national team, according to multiple reports on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Athletic and ESPN reported that unnamed sources confirmed Pochettino, who parted ways with English Premier League side Chelsea in May, would replace Gregg Berhalter as boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino, 52, would arrive as the United States prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino left Chelsea after finishing sixth in the Premier League in his only season in charge, after previous stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports said the deal was struck after multiple conversations with US Soccer Federation technical director Matt Crocker, and that no contract has been signed nor has the federation's board of directors agreed a deal with Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentinian cannot sign a contract with US Soccer until a pay situation with Chelsea is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino would be expected to take over the US squad in time for a friendly against Canada on September 7 at Kansas City. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-ranked defending champion Coco Gauff crashed out in her opening match at the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Open, falling to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The second-round shock to America's Paris Olympic flag-bearer stunned a partisan crowd in the US heartland in the final major tuneup for the US Open on August 26, where Gauff is defending champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva, ranked 34th, has made a recent habit of upsets, knocking off world number one Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon third round barely a month ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really proud of myself," said Putintseva. "Even if the crowd was cheering for Coco, they were fair with me. "These courts are so fast, you have to just play on instinct. That's what I did."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff became the youngest winner at Cincinnati a year ago at age 19 and carried that success into her first Grand Slam triumph at the US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva will next face Spain's Paula Badosa, who defeated Anna Kalinsyaka 6-3, 6-2. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 2 percent after July US retail sales data signaled resilient consumer spending, allaying fears of an imminent recession in the world's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Retail sales increased 1.0 percent after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent drop in June, easing fears of a sharp economic slowdown fanned by a jump in the unemployment rate last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail bellwether Walmart rose 6.58 percent after raising its annual profit forecast for the second time this year as Americans flocked to its stores for inexpensive essentials. Rivals Target and Costco also advanced 4.35 percent and 1.69 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate reading also showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wall of worry is beginning to crumble as sentiment is improving and the fundamentals support a risk-on bias," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. "Retail sales were above expectations, Consumer Price Index numbers came in at a tolerable level, so the fundamental backdrop is consistent with rising equity prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors have cautiously eyed this week's economic data releases, the last set before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivers a much-awaited speech at Jackson Hole next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39 percent, to 40,563. The S&P 500 gained 1.61 percent, at 5,543. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.34 percent, to 17,595.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other movers, Cisco Systems rose 6.8 percent after it forecast better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and said it was cutting 7 percent of its global workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike climbed 5.07 percent as billionaire investor William Ackman built new stakes in the sportswear company. Ulta Beauty jumped 11.17 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a stake in the cosmetics store chain. (Reuters)

    Biden says he "beat Big Pharma" with drug price deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has negotiated down the prices of 10 top-selling prescription drugs used by Medicare by as much as 79 percent, hoping to save US$6 billion in the first year as part of a plan hailed on Thursday by President Joe Biden with the aim to ease anger about high prices ahead of November elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, was the first to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most costly drugs that the programme covers for 66 million people. The new prices will go into effect in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We finally beat Big Pharma," Biden said at an event in Largo, Maryland, alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration hopes the savings will ease Americans' anger about high prices, an issue they frequently say is their top concern headed into the closely contested November 5 presidential election between Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs," Harris said. "Medicare can use that (collective bargaining) power to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new prices represent cuts to individual list prices that do not reflect any rebates and discounts the government may already be getting for the drugs, although the government's estimated savings from the negotiations do take those discounts into account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' tie-breaking Senate vote passed the law that allows for the drug-price negotiations, which no Republicans supported. In a statement, she also pointed to her work as California attorney general holding "big pharma accountable for their deceptive and illegal practices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said people covered by Medicare, which mostly serves Americans aged 65 and over, would also save US$1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs for the prescription medicines in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merck & Co's diabetes drug Januvia faces the steepest percentage price cut of the drugs on the list, decreasing 79 percent, while Novo Nordisk's insulin aspart products will face the second steepest of 76 percent, according to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other eight drugs on the list face cuts of between 68 percent and 38 percent.

 Sweden confirmed its first case of the viral infection mpox on Thursday, which was also the first case outside Africa, a day after the WHO declared the disease a global public health emergency for the second time in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The person was infected while staying in a part of Africa where there was a large outbreak of the disease, Olivia Wigzell, director-general at the Swedish Public Health Agency, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation made its announcement over mpox, which spreads through close contact, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries of a more serious type of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I," Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed told the press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigzell said the person who was infected had received care and instructions in line with the health agency's recommendations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The case is the first caused by Clade I that has been diagnosed outside the African continent. The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade I," she said. (Reuters)

    Five charged over death of 'Friends' actor Perry

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Criminal charges have been filed against five people in connection with the death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry nearly a year ago, law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defendants include two doctors and an assistant to Perry who were part of "a broad underground criminal network" that distributed large quantities of the prescription drug ketamine to the actor and others, US Attorney Martin Estrada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These defendants took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves," Estrada said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry died at age 54 from "acute effects" of ketamine, a powerful sedative, in addition to other factors that caused the actor to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub last October, an autopsy said. For months, Los Angeles homicide detectives and federal agents have been investigating how Perry obtained the prescription drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A December 2023 autopsy report concluded Perry died from the "acute effects of ketamine," which combined with other factors caused the actor to lose consciousness and slip below the water in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toxicology tests found Perry's body contained dangerously high levels of ketamine, a short-acting anaesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Typically, people with that much ketamine in their systems are in general aesthesia during surgery, and being monitored by professionals, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other contributing factors in his death were drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of the opioid-addiction medicine buprenorphine, which was also detected in his system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of drug and alcohol abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends." He had been sober for 19 months with no known relapses before his death, according to interviews cited in his autopsy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witness interviews in the autopsy report said he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, so the ketamine found in his system by medical examiners would have been introduced since that last infusion, the autopsy said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda pair of Ying Ying and Le Le have finally produced babies, after they successfully mated in March this year at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After five months of pregnancy, Ying Ying gave birth to one female and one male in the small hours of Thursday. Ocean Park, where the giant panda lives, said she spent much of her time lying on the ground and twisting, and that she was in labour for more than five hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ocean Park Hong Kong is thrilled to welcome the birth of the first-ever giant panda twins in Hong Kong," the amusement park said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This birth is a true rarity, especially considering Ying Ying is the oldest giant panda on record to have successfully given birth for the first time," the park said, adding that she gave birth just one day before her 19th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilise, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth. Currently, both babies are under 24-hour intensive care by the park’s animal care and veterinary team, as well as experts from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee called the birth of the panda twins a very special occasion, and thanked the nation for having gifted Ying Ying and Le Le to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Ocean Park's team for taking good care of the city's giant pandas and experts from the research centre for their support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested the driver of a tram involved in a fatal crash that killed a three-year-old girl in Western District on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tram was travelling along the eastbound track of Praya, Kennedy Town at 10.40am, officers said. But when it approached the pedestrian crossing near Des Voeux Road West, it reportedly knocked down four people who were crossing the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year-old girl was trapped under the tram and was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital in an unconscious state. She was certified dead at about 12.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A six-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man also sustained injuries and were sent to the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 48-year-old male driver on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and that he is currently being detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For their part, Hong Kong Tramways said that according to their preliminary understanding, the tram was operating as usual when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that they suspended the driver after the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it is very concerned about the incident and that it has asked the tramway operator to investigate it in detail and submit a report as soon as possible.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s populist Pheu Thai party on Thursday nominated its party chief, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, in a Parliament vote for the country’s new leader after former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was removed by a court order over an ethical violation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn said she was ready to work for the country to move it forward and promised give her best, after securing her candidacy for prime minister by the governing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined, together and will push the country forward," she told a press conference ahead of Friday's parliamentary vote on a new premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is seen as force behind Pheu Thai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the first Thai politician ever to win an overall majority of seats. The residual popularity of Thaksin is a factor in the support for Paetongtarn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Paetongtarn is approved by Parliament's vote she would become Thailand’s second female prime minister, and the country’s third leader from the Shinwatra family after her father and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra. (Agencies)
