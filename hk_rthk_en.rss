<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It would be unrealistic to try to stop people from spending their free time across the border and abroad, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, amid complaints from local retailers and restaurants over flagging business as more Hongkongers choose to spend their money elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee advised the retail industry to acknowledge the structural change in consumption patterns, and address the problem by seeking reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a joint radio phone-in programme, one day after delivering his third Policy Address, Lee said the SAR is undergoing a period of transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It’s time to stop dwelling on the past success, he told businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall speaking, the retail industry isn’t doing really well. Even as we boost inbound tourism, we must first acknowledge the structural change of their consumption pattern," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone needs to keep improving – not just the one in front of you or next to you. Start with yourself. Of course the government will try to help, but there will be ups and downs," he said, adding that he aims to compress this "transition period" as much as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Hong Kong retailers and restaurants also say they are struggling to compete for customers against rivals in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one and half million Hong Kong residents left the city via various land borders over the Chung Yeung Festival long weekend, dealing a fresh blow to local businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee said this is only normal market behaviour, and the government will do its best to help local businesses, including looking at ways to tackle high rent and costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that being as Hong Kong’s economy is undergoing a period of change, one of the government’s roles is to look for new growth areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities will now look into building a commodity trading ecosystem, leveraging on Hong Kong’s safe and free environment, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A “global trader” has signalled its intention to establish a metal warehouse in Hong Kong, Lee said, describing this as the perfect starting point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, the chief executive pledged to forge full speed ahead with a plan to regulate subdivided homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has proposed a bill which will set a minimum size and other conditions for the units, and landlords which don't register their properties will be prosecuted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With an estimated 110,000 such units, Lee said one headache would be deciding how long the registration period should last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm an impatient man...I said, how about 12 to 18 months? But with 110,000 units to deal with, and divided by 12 months, we have to register about 9,000 each month. Is this pragmatic? I would need to discuss this with my colleagues," he said.

    China boosts credit to shore up property market

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Housing and Urban-Rural Development Minister Ni Hong leaves at the end of a press conference on China's property sector. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774941_1_20241017114222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a "white list" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million "urban villages" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun," Ni told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, China announced a plan for a "white list" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Approved loans for the "white list" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)

    'New HOS rules help people climb housing ladder'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says the Housing Authority will allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774925_1_20241017101330.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst at a local think-tank has welcomed this year's Policy Address as one focused on improving the quality of people's lives, saying the increased chances for young people to attain an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme would motivate them to climb up the housing ladder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jason Leung, the Head of Land and Housing at the Our Hong Kong Foundation, made the comment on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme on Thursday after Chief Executive John Lee said the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, if we are talking about Home Ownership Scheme flats, the numbers offered for sale each year is very low. It's about 3,000 to 4,000 a year perhaps. Now it's getting more and more and moving to about 8,000 to 9,000 per year. So it's slightly easier to get a flat in the balloting right now and especially with the new mechanism that people who previously were unsuccessful in the balloting could get you know more ballots," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Youths could get a more preferential treatment as well. So the Home Ownership Scheme flats, these are more accessible to these people right now, and I think that this will be a positive direction for people to attain home ownership."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Leung said residents living in subdivided units that do not meet the minimum standards could potentially be moved to transitional housing given its flexible conditions, after Lee said the government would propose a new set of standards which include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the distribution of transitional housing, actually there are quite a number of them that are in the urban areas as well, and as the government constructs more light public housing and public rental housing in the coming few years, existing tenants in the transitional housing could move on to these government-run housing programmes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The space in these transitional housing in the urban areas can then be released and hopefully used to house these people that could be affected by these subdivided units."

    China's lab seeks answer to scientific riddle

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This photo taken during a media tour shows the exterior view of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Kaiping, in southern China's Guangdong province. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774928_1_20241017102501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far beneath the lush landscape of southern China, a sprawling subterranean laboratory aims to be the world's first to crack a deep scientific enigma.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China has emerged as a science powerhouse in recent years, with the country's leadership pouring billions of dollars into advanced research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its latest showpiece is the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno), a state-of-the-art facility for studying the minuscule subatomic particles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project is an "exciting" opportunity to delve into some of the universe's most fundamental -- but elusive -- building blocks, according to Patrick Huber, director of the Center for Neutrino Physics at the American university Virginia Tech, who is not involved in the facility's research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International media was recently given a tour of the observatory in Kaiping, Guangdong province, organised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's national science agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lab is reached by a funicular train that travels down a tunnel to a cavern built 700 metres underground to limit radiation emissions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inside stands the neutrino detector, a stainless steel and acrylic sphere around 35 metres in diameter, crisscrossed by cables.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one has built such a detector before," Wang Yifang, Juno's project manager and director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, said as workers in hard hats applied the finishing touches to the gleaming orb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can see from the scale, it was technologically complicated," Wang said as he waved a laser pen over different parts of the installation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Started in 2014, Juno has cost around 2.2 billion yuan to build and is due for completion next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It aims to solve a fundamental physics puzzle about the particles' nature faster than scientists in the United States, a world leader in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its research could also help us better understand planet Earth, the Sun, and other stars and supernovas. (AFP)

    Alcaraz to face Nadal in Six Kings Slam semis
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alcaraz in action against Denmark's Holger Rune at the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774910_1_20241017082310.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz admitted Wednesday it will be a "difficult moment" facing "idol" Rafael Nadal when the Spanish superstars clash for the final time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadal, the winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, announced last week that he will retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, however, the 38-year-old will take on Alcaraz for a place in the final of the "Six Kings Slam" exhibition event in Riyadh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since I started to play tennis, I'm watching his matches. I look up to him and I grew up watching him. He was my idol, he is still my idol," Alcaraz said on court after defeating Holger Rune 6-4, 6-2 to set-up an emotional meeting with Nadal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A really important person for my life, for my career and he was one of the reasons that I wanted to become a professional tennis player. Knowing he is going to retire is pretty tough for everyone, for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion, added: "I will try to enjoy sharing the court with him once again, but I think it is really difficult for everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal and Alcaraz have met three times on the main ATP Tour with the soon-to-be retired veteran holding a 2-1 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish pair played doubles together at the Paris Olympics this year and they are expected to team-up again at the Davis Cup Finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal also made his last singles appearance at the Games on the same Roland Garros courts where he won 14 French Open titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His Olympic singles campaign was ended by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Thursday's other semi-final in Riyadh sees Djokovic tackle Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Sinner eased past Daniil Medvedev 6-0, 6-3 on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The semi-final against Novak will be a different match than the ones we played in the past," said Sinner who defeated the 24-time Grand Slam title winner in the Shanghai Masters final last Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know each other quite well and we know what to expect from each other," the 23-year-old added. "I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I am just trying to play the best possible tennis, and we will see how it goes." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paul Pogba is adamant that he wishes to return from his reduced doping ban with Juventus even if it means accepting a pay cut, the French World Cup winner told La Gazzetta dello Sport in an interview Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I'm willing to give up money to be able to play again with Juve, I want to come back with this club," said Pogba in an interview published on the Italian sports daily's website. "The reality is that I am a Juve player and I am preparing to play for Juve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogba's contract with the Italian giants expires in June 2026 and is currently worth US$8.6 million a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his ongoing suspension, the midfielder receives only the minimum salary stipulated in the Serie A collective agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, since Pogba's ban was reduced, Italian press have reported that Juventus are nonetheless seeking to terminate his contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will be a new Pogba, a hungrier, wiser and stronger one – I just want to play football," added the former Manchester United star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to be ready to train and play for Juve, I'm a Juve player," he added. "In my mind, that's all there is at the moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogba had his four-year ban for doping reduced to 18 months earlier in October by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and can return to action from March 11 next year, four days before his 32nd birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogba tested positive for testosterone in August 2023 after a match between Juventus and Udinese in Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was provisionally suspended in September of the same year, and then banned for four years by the Italian National Anti-Doping Tribunal the following February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogba's representatives said the testosterone came from a food supplement prescribed by a doctor he consulted in the United States. (AFP)

 British singer Liam Payne, a former member of the group One Direction, died on Wednesday aged 31 after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Argentina, police in Buenos Aires said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Liam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Palermo," a police statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boy band sensation One Direction emerged in 2010 when then-teenagers Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik appeared on the British television contest "The X Factor."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2016, the group announced it was going on an indefinite hiatus, but not splitting up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Payne announced he was working on a solo album that same year, following in the footsteps of other band members. (AFP)

 US stocks bounced back on Wednesday after retreating a day prior, while earnings season was off to a relatively positive start.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones gained 0.8 percent to 43,077, while the S&P 500 Index added 0.5 percent to 5,842.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq advanced 0.3 percent, closing at 18,367.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks picked up towards the end of the day as investors sought to "buy the dip," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also, the nuclear stocks are going crazy on the Amazon announcement," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech giant Amazon announced significant investments in nuclear energy on Wednesday, joining other major companies in aiming to meet the high electric power demands of artificial intelligence using atomic energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its shares closed 0.4 percent lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among companies that reported financial results this week, Morgan Stanley beat estimates with its third quarter report on Wednesday – after quarterly results from Goldman Sachs showed a jump in profits a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick said the bank saw a "strong third quarter in a constructive environment," and its shares closed 6.5 percent up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "not a lot of conviction after yesterday's chipmaker-led declines," noted Briefing.com on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dutch tech giant ASML saw its shares plunge after it unveiled a cut to its 2025 guidance and slump in sales bookings, sending share prices of other firms falling on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Nvidia recovered some ground on Wednesday, with its shares up 3.1 percent, ASML and AMD both logged declines still. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Wednesday further relaxed visa rules for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents, allowing for more people to apply for multiple-entry visas that allow individual visits of up to six months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Back in July, mainland authorities announced a five-year card for non-Chinese permanent Hong Kong residents, allowing them to travel to the mainland. The card allows stays of up to 90 days and use of the speedier e-gates at immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said that with immediate effect, both permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong who are non-Chinese can apply for the visas of up to five years, with each trip lasting a maximum 180 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[This is] to facilitate personnel exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, [and] support Hong Kong’s integration into the overall development of the country," the office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that this applies to applicants going to the mainland for business, travel, visiting family members, as well as cultural and academic exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants will not need to submit a receipt for return transport tickets and hotel bookings. They also will not have to get their fingerprints recorded again if they underwent the procedure during a previous visa application.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office added that the new policy does not apply to foreign domestic workers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday proposed closer three-way ties with Russia and Mongolia at a meeting with counterparts from the neighbouring countries on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said the nation is willing to make contributions to the development and revitalisation of the two countries and the prosperity and stability of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told Mishustin that China was willing to strengthen trade and energy ties with Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li added that enhancing cooperation and promoting deeper and practical trilateral cooperation with Russia and Mongolia would better benefit the people of the three countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mongolia is not a member of the SCO, having chosen instead to be an observer state since 2004. The landlocked nation is on the planned route of a major pipeline that Russia wants to build to carry 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year from its Yamal region to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Eurasian leaders have gathered in the Pakistani capital Islamabad for the SCO summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the event, Li said the SCO is an important platform for safeguarding regional peace and stability and promoting the development and prosperity of all countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his opening remarks, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the expansion of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan economic corridor, which is in its second phase and the international north south transport corridor, should be expanded focusing on developing road, rail and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also in attendance was India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan in nearly a decade with ties between the nuclear-armed rival neighbours continuing to be frosty. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has captured two more villages in different parts of eastern Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Wednesday, as Russian forces continue their steady advance in the region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Moscow has been claiming gains in Ukraine's embattled east regularly since the summer, advancing towards the city of Pokrovsk, from where thousands have fled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its defence ministry said troops had captured the village of Krasnyi Yar, south of the town of Myrnograd, which lies close to Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has rushed evacuations of tens of thousands of people from Pokrovsk and Myrnograd as Russian troops advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further north, Moscow also said it had captured the village of Nevske, which lies in the Lugansk region, near the border with the Donetsk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It published images of a village with one main road, lined with heavily destroyed houses, and a Russian soldier flying Moscow's flag through a window of a badly damaged house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aerial footage showed the small village to be almost entirely destroyed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow made the claims as Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky presented his vision of how to end two years of fighting to parliament in Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In it, he rejected any territorial concessions and urged for ramped-up Western backing, including an invitation to join Nato. (AFP)

    Principal moratorium will help SMEs: chamber

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Patrick Yeung of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce says the measures unveiled in the Policy Address will help small and medium enterprises address their financial challenges. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774834_1_20241016173752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday welcomed the measures unveiled in the Policy Address to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think most important to note is that the proposal to revive the mortgage moratorium, to allow the SMEs to repay the interest rather than the capital for the month borrowed for the mortgage," the chamber's CEO Patrick Yeung told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a way to help them to address the current financial challenges."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee announced in his policy blueprint that SMEs can apply for a principal moratorium for up to 12 months to ease their cash-flow pressure, if they borrow money under government-backed loan schemes. Authorities will also offer partial principal repayment options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On government plans to kick-start the city's low-altitude economy by exploring the use of aerial technology, such as drones, Yeung said officials need to overcome technical challenges if they are to make use of low-altitude airspace for economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to look into the infrastructure, then where will be the good place to put up a space, and where to put up charging facilities, et cetera," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, it's a good idea, but definitely not an easy one to tackle with all those technical challenges possible facing this low-altitude economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government will set up a cross-departmental task force led by the deputy financial secretary to explore the use of technologies at the airspace within an altitude of up to 1,000 metres.

    'Liquor duty cut won't have big effect on prices'
   </title>
   <link>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The wine and spirits industry on Wednesday said Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits won't have a huge effect on the sector, or the public.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong General Chamber of Wine and Spirits welcomed the move, but said the change will only be noticed when it comes to luxury products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's not easy for the industry, also for the catering sector to slash prices at this moment. I think it only benefits those expensive items, for example, [those with a] retail price of over HK$1,000," Raymond Luk, who chairs the chamber's economic policy and social affairs committee, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Man, general manager at Wai Shing Wine and Spirits, said only around 20 percent of customers buy spirits that are priced over HK$1,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We originally hoped that citizens would be able to use around HK$500 to HK$800 to buy and enjoy liquor of better quality. But the policy now... consumers will still have to increase their budget to get better spirits, it is hard to tell whether they will be willing to do that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Man said he would like to see the HK$200 threshold for the duty cut reduced by half, so more kinds of liquor would be covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luk added that such a move would increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong's liquor market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the current rates under the new policy, we are still the highest in East Asia. But in the long term, I think it's possible that we'll gain an increased appeal as a high-end spirit destination due to the reduction in taxes, as well as the speeding up of the development of activities related to high-end prestige spirits like trading, distribution and auctions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said officials moved to slash the tax on hard liquor because they saw market opportunities similar to the ones that followed after the duty on wine was abolished in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press conference, Lee said officials made the decision considering that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the objective was to boost the trade in high-end liquor and hoped it would have a similar effect to the abolition of wine duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted the import and re-export value of red wine last year rose by 375 percent compared to 2007, the year before the product became tax free in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over one year after wine duty has been reduced, we saw an increase of about 350 operators of wine, and an increase of about 1,000 jobs. The income for that sector increased by about 35 percent," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee stressed the government isn't encouraging people to drink, saying it has struck a balance between public health and the need to develop the hard liquor market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Licensed Bar and Club Association, meanwhile, said that though bar operators support the tax cut, it might not bring immediate benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's founding president, Ben Leung, said he thinks the measures can boost Hong Kong's competitiveness in the global liquor market in the long run, because more brands and different types of spirits would enter the local market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But bars cannot benefit immediately because above them [in the chain], there are importers and agents, they themselves might need some time to digest [the news] and make adjustments. They might not have room to lower prices immediately," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also called on the Chief Executive to review how to better promote the local night economy, saying that would "expand the room for survival" for small to medium enterprises.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli strikes have killed at least 15 people in the southern Lebanese town of Qana while the Israeli military attacked Beirut's southern suburbs early on Wednesday for the first time in nearly a week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes in Qana late on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lebanon's Civil Defence said 15 bodies had been recovered from the rubble of a building and that rescue efforts were still underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the strikes on southern Beirut were the first in six days, and came after Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the United States had given him assurances that Israel would curb its strikes on the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate word on casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has a strong presence in southern Beirut, known as the Dahiyeh, which is also a residential and commercial area home to large numbers of civilians and people unaffiliated with the militant group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said it targeted an arms warehouse under a residential building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It posted an evacuation warning on the X platform ahead of the strike, saying it was targeting a building in the Haret Hreik neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A year of low-level fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border escalated into all-out war last month , and has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 2,300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since last October, more than three-quarters of them in the past month, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reactions to the government’s plan to eradicate poor quality subdivided units (SDUs) were largely supportive, although there were also calls for the administration to ensure adequate follow-up actions to support affected tenants during the transition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proposed new laws require each unit to be at least eight square metres, or 86 square feet in size and have its own toilet and windows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A concern group said it estimates that 20 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units would be affected under the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenny Ng from the Concerning Grassroot Housing Rights Alliance called on the government to come up with ways to make sure affected tenants had a place to live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government didn't mention how to relocate those residents who are living in subdivided flats who will be affected under this scheme."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will they be arranged to some other housing for their relocation, or will they just let them rent other private housing themselves? If so, I think those deprived groups will rent some other subdivided flats which will be illegal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng said the government could consider using unused public housing or transitional housing units to settle affected residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, an NGO that connects deprived groups with landlords said the government should establish a clear timeline for when the law will be in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai Kin-kwok from the ComHome Social Housing Platform also called for more detailed criteria regarding the minimum living standards for subdivided units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can't find the timeline, especially when the law will be established and then how long the grace period is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think from the information now, we don't know whether the windows can be opened or not... And regarding the eight square metres, I think that's the minimum standard, but it depends on how many residents are inside the eight square metres,” Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He anticipated that landlords of subdivided flats not affected by the proposed laws would consider increasing rents, saying he was disappointed the Policy Address did not address the need for a rent cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said a two-month consultation will take place in December, with the aim of submitting related legislative proposals to Legco next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in a media briefing after the Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said it would take a few years to root out the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First of all, we'll have to pass the legislation, which I think the earliest will probably be next year. Then, we will introduce the registration period. My suggestion is either 12 months or 18 months," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Then we'll introduce the tolerance period for adjustments, structurally, to be made. That may be one year, two years, again subject to discussion by Legco."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the sources, penalties for landlords who fail to make improvements after the grace period would include possible imprisonment and fines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for a subdivided tenant surnamed Au, the law enforcement actions might not pose a deterrent effect to her landlord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pays a monthly rent of HK$2,500 for 20-square-foot room with no individual toilet and kitchen, a space that falls in the sub-standard SDU category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In this flat, if they combine two rooms and provide more than 90 [square] feet, I’m fine. They have a window, I’m fine. I don’t mind if there is no air conditioning. But I think my landlord will not change, he'll just pay the penalty without doing anything if the government penalises him,” Au said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The environment I have now, if I have to be honest, what difference is there from sleeping on the streets? It’s bad that there is no air con on the streets and dust and dirt is emitted from cars, but at least you feel more comfortable and have more space,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au said she had doubts about whether the government could carry out its plan successfully and would stay in her unit until she gets allocated public housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow. Like if tomorrow I buy a lottery ticket, I don’t know if I will win,” she said.

    Property sector welcomes mortgage rules relaxation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The property sector is happy about the relaxation of mortgage restrictions, saying it will boost the property market and overall economy. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774800_1_20241016155146.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The property sector on Wednesday welcomed the government's move to ease mortgage restrictions, saying it will significantly boost the property market and the overall economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his third Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee announced that the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for homes will be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) will be raised to 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, from real estate services firm CBRE, said she thinks the relaxation will boost transaction volumes, especially in the luxury market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will give a better liquidity for the homebuyers, the people who are looking for the upgrading demand, or they want to enter the market [for the] first time given the good discount offering from the developers. And their down payment amount has been reduced by utilising this LTV ratio increase," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this improvement will affect, in a possible way, the luxury residential [market] more, because previously it was only 60 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joseph Tsang, chairman of real estate services company JLL, said the LTV move will boost transaction volumes for new residential projects, but it won't be strong enough to reverse the downward trend in housing prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The future trend of Hong Kong housing prices will largely depend on the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures introduced by the mainland government," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real estate and construction sector lawmaker Louis Loong also welcomed the changes, adding that he is happy to see the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit back to pre-2009 levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This sends a very positive message to the entire property market. We have always told the government that a weak property market is not beneficial for Hong Kong's overall economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe this will have a very positive effect on Hong Kong's entire property market and even on the economy as a whole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the founder and chief executive of Centaline Property Group, Shih Wing-ching, said some remained concerned about potential declines in property values despite the relaxation in mortgage rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What now worries people is no longer the difficulty to get a mortgage loan. People worry about the risk of further declines in property value. So quite a lot of people now choose to rent rather to purchase. If they choose to rent, the relaxation of this ratio could not do them any good," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This policy of course can help a little bit, but the property market is more complex. You need to also look at interest rates, supply and demand. The problem now is that people have not really established their faith in the future, so they are not willing to commit too much at this moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shih added the move alone is not enough to boost developers' appetite for land because it also depends on improvements in transaction volumes and inventory levels in the primary market.

    Govt to subsidise care-home spots in Guangdong
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is launching a new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in care homes in Guangdong, while it will also expand an existing subsidy programme to include more facilities in the province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address that a three-year pilot programme will allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The existing Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong, meanwhile, will be expanded, with seven more residential homes joining the programme in November 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government is also providing more help to needy elderly people who want to remain in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said there will be a 20-percent increase in the number of vouchers given out to elderly people in need of care, but are still waiting for a subsidised spot in a home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six-thousand vouchers will be given out to allow beneficiaries to be admitted to homes of their choice without the need to wait further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive also announced other poverty-alleviation measures in his Policy Address, including more than doubling the number of schools offering after-school care services for primary students to allow their parents to work; and expanding its existing “Strive and Rise” programme, where underprivileged children are matched up with mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The School-based After-School Care Service Scheme will increase from 50 to over 110 schools, Lee said, and more schools will be encouraged to join, such that there’s no planned cap to the number of students who can benefit from the programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An additional 100 day child care services will be provided at new child care centre, and service places under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project will be increased by 25 percent, to 2,500.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that the government will step up its support for young people hoping to buy subsidised flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He announced in his Policy Address that the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40, to increase their chances of getting an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that starting from the next White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) exercise, the quota for those flats will increase by 1,500 -- all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants under the age of 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in a bid to encourage more public housing tenants to buy Home Ownership Scheme units, the government said it will revise the allocation between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants from its current ratio of 4:6 to 5:5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, as part of efforts to crack down on tenancy abuse, the Housing Authority will launch the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" in January next year, offering rewards to anyone providing intelligence that helps to identify such cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said the government hopes to cut the average waiting time for public rental housing from the current 5.5 years to 4.5 years in 2026-27.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The principal moratorium scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be relaunched as part of efforts to help businesses as Hong Kong undergoes economic restructuring.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said in his Policy Address on Wednesday that firms will be allowed to apply for principal moratorium for up to 12 months under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum loan guarantee periods of the 80 percent and 90 percent guarantee products will be extended to 10 years and eight years respectively, while the partial principal repayment options will be offered to new loans under the two guarantee products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures to support SMEs include a HK$1 billion injection into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales to help them upgrade their operations and develop new markets, as well as fresh efforts to further promote Hong Kong brands.

    Loan-to-value ratio for mortgages to be relaxed: CE
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The loan-to-value ratio will be relaxed to 70 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774730_1_20241016122657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In a bid to encourage more people to purchase a home and to stimulate the city's property market, Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government would relax the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of mortgage loans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This would allow people to borrow more against the value of a property they want to buy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outlining the proposal in his Policy Address, Lee said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would adjust the maximum LTV ratio for homes to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) would be adjusted to 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For non-residential properties, the maximum LTV ratio and the maximum DSR would be adjusted to the same levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA said the adjustments apply to provisional sale and purchase agreements signed from Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the latest market developments, the HKMA has decided to adjust the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans and revert the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced," HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even with these adjustments announced today, the Hong Kong banking sector has ample buffers to cope with any challenges from a sharp correction in property prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to remind the public that buying a property is a long-term financial commitment. Prospective buyers should carefully assess the risks involved and their ability to afford a property."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also announced that the government will relax a policy granting residency to people who invest a minimum of HK$30 million in different forms of assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting from Wednesday, purchases of property worth HK$50 million or more will be counted as fulfilling a third of the requirement for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme. The amount of real estate investment to be counted towards the total capital investment is capped at $10 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV forum, Lee brushed off concerns that the relaxation could lead to an overheating of property prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because their investment will not affect the willingness of our citizens to buy houses. We only allow them [investors] to buy properties valued over HK$50 million," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now, the property market is starting to stabilise. We are not worried that will result in any negative impact. I think that will attract more investment while benefiting the growth of our real estate market."

    Culture, sport and pandas to bring visitors to HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government is working on a series of measures to enhance Hong Kong's status as a cultural, sports and tourism magnet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his Policy Address, Lee said the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) will release a blueprint later this year on promoting Chinese culture, the development of arts and culture with an international perspective, fostering arts and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world, and driving industry development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency is incubating cultural and creative projects with a potential for industrialisation and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and leveraging market resources to help the sector explore business opportunities, the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turning to the West Kowloon Cultural District, Lee said the authority running the arts hub will take a leading role in building Hong Kong's strengths in arts trading and the restoration and exhibition of high-end private art collections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority will promote the district as a prime destination for major international cultural events, while also curating arts programmes and exhibitions to be staged on the mainland and overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government will continue to foster sports development by enhancing the development of athletes and coaches, and promoting sports in the community by providing more facilities, including a swimming complex suitable for international competitions and a sports arena with fencing facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government will develop a "host city economy" in the sports industry, so local athletes can compete in international events on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE noted that Kai Tak Sports Park will open in the first quarter of next year and said the site will "boost sports development and inject impetus into related industries such as recreation, entertainment and tourism and also mega-event economy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On tourism, Lee said the government will develop Hong Kong into a premier destination through innovative thinking and by making better use of rich and unique resources such as Victoria Harbour, the outlying islands, rural areas, cultures, cuisine, lifestyles and historic buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These elements, combined with our edges in technology, animation and comics, the performing arts, film and television culture and more will help to instil the concept of 'tourism is everywhere'", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CSTB will publish a blueprint for the tourism industry later this year, which among other things will cover developing eco-tourism such as "island-hopping tours", and attracting tourists from the Middle East and Asean members with measures such as information in Arabic at the airport, a list of halal restaurants, and encouraging hotels to provide worship facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other plans include the promotion of "yacht tourism", "panda tourism", "horse-racing tourism" and a gourmet guide covering all 18 districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A working group led by the chief secretary is also going to be set up to identify and develop tourist hotspots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said Beijing is studying SAR government proposals to enhance visas for visitors from the mainland, including the resumption of a multiple-entry arrangement for Shenzhen residents, while the criteria for multiple-entry visas will be relaxed for people from Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive said in his Policy Address on Wednesday the government would introduce legislation for a system to govern the renting of subdivided flats, with the goal of helping people improve their conditions by insisting on standards that ensure the health and safety of those that live in these types of units.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sub-divided units (SDUs) which meet the required living standards would be named as Basic Housing Units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Lee said the government would propose the standards of Basic Housing Units should include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said current SDUs differ significantly in standards and it was necessary to set a minimum standard to eradicate subdivided flats which are not fit to live in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under appropriate regulation, the market demand for SDUs would be satisfied by introducing these revamped Basic Housing Units which meet the required standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SDUs that are of poor quality must be converted into Basic Housing Units that meet the required standards. Upon conversion, certified professionals must give their approval to ensure the conversion meets the minimum standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Owners who continue to rent out substandard SDUs under the new system would be held criminally liable, while tenants would not be held liable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government would allow time for owners of existing SDUs to carry out the necessary renovation works to meet the new standards. A grace period would be implemented during which enforcement action would not be taken against the illegal renting of subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Secretary for Housing would be empowered by law to decide, upon expiry of the grace period, when to take enforcement action against sub-standard SDUs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deputy financial secretary and secretary for housing would announce further details and seek the views of Legco and other stakeholders for drawing up the legislative proposals and related measures.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Aaron Judge smacked his first home run of the Major League Baseball playoffs and the New York Yankees beat Cleveland 6-3 on Tuesday, seizing command of the American League Championship Series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Judge broke open a tight game with his two-run blast in the seventh inning as the Yankees grabbed a 2-0 lead in the best-of seven series, which continues on Thursday in Cleveland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've got to keep things the same," Judge said. "It's going to be a loud environment, a fun environment. We've got to go out there and keep playing our game – feed off the energy and go from there."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The series winner advances to the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yankees slugger Judge, whose 58 regular-season homers led MLB, crushed a blast over the centerfield wall to give New York a 6-2 lead with his 14th career playoff homer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was good to add two more runs there," Judge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guardians stranded 11 base runners as four Yankees relief pitchers baffled Cleveland after starter Gerrit Cole went only 4 1/3 innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These guys came in, they're healthy, they're feeling great, some great performances from quite a few guys at the back end," Judge said of New York's relievers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yankees are seeking their first trip to the World Series since winning it for the record 27th time in 2009, while Cleveland has not reached the event since 2016 and last won a World Series in 1948. (AFP)

    Rape probe in Sweden after reports Mbappé is suspect

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Swedish media on Tuesday reported that Mbappé was the target of a rape investigation. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774657_1_20241015233253.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Swedish prosecutor on Tuesday said – without mentioning Kylian Mbappé – that a rape investigation had been opened, after media reported that the Real Madrid and France star was the suspect during a visit to Stockholm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In response to media reports about a suspected rape in Stockholm, the prosecutor can confirm that a criminal report has been submitted to the police," Sweden's Prosecution Authority said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the alleged incident occurred at a hotel on October 10, but did not name a suspect and said no further information could be shared for the moment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swedish newspapers Aftonbladet and Expressen, as well as public broadcaster SVT, on Tuesday reported that 25-year-old Mbappé was the target of the investigation, following his two-day visit to the Swedish capital last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French international visited Stockholm with a group of people last Thursday, as he was not selected for his country's latest round of Nations League matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Aftonbladet, the group dined at a restaurant before going to a nightclub, and left Sweden last Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the complaint was filed last Saturday after the alleged victim had sought medical attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expressen reported on Tuesday that police had seized some clothing as evidence, saying it consisted of women's underwear, a pair of black trousers and a black top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, citing anonymous sources, Expressen identified Mbappé as the suspect, while Aftonbladet and SVT said on Tuesday they had also had obtained information confirming Mbappe was the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Mbappé on Monday posted on X that there was a link between the Aftonbladet report and his hearing before a French league committee on Tuesday, in his dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain over what he says are unpaid wages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "FAKE NEWS !!!!. It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance," Mbappé said in the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé claims he is owed US$60 million by the Qatari-owned French champions. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee has outlined proposals to attract more overseas students to study in tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774725_1_20241016122037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to develop Hong Kong into an international tertiary education hub in his Policy Address with various measures such as creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government will encourage local post-secondary institutions to enhance collaboration with their counterparts around the world in promoting the "Study in Hong Kong" brand on a global scale, with an aim to attract more overseas students to study here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added Hong Kong will strive to host international education conferences and exhibitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also announced the setting up of the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies from the 2025/26 academic year, offering scholarships each year to up to 1,200 local students enrolling in designated postgraduate programmes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a projected shortage of 180,000 workers across different sectors in Hong Kong in the next five years, Lee said the government will reform its talent admission schemes to try to attract more staff from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It'll add 13 top mainland and overseas universities to the list of institutions under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, raising the total to 198, and the validity period of the first visa of high-income talent will be extended from two to three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures is the introduction of a new mechanism under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, inviting top talent to come here for development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government will set up a new committee – the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents – to coordinate the integrated development of those fields. It'll be led by the chief secretary.

    Harris mocks Trump after rally turns into dance-a-thon

    <![CDATA[<img alt="On Monday two medical emergencies in the crowd turned into a bizarre 39 minutes of music and dancing as Donald Trump played nine of his favourite songs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774708_1_20241016120547.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris went after her US presidential election rival Donald Trump's mental state and fitness for office on Tuesday after the 78-year-old Republican's televised town hall veered into a surreal, impromptu music session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three weeks ahead of the US election, Harris's campaign has begun to focus aggressively on Trump's health and mental stability, and was quick to weigh in, saying the ex-president appeared "lost, confused, and frozen on stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For about half an hour, Monday's event in Oaks near Philadelphia was standard fare ahead of the November 5 election, as Trump took friendly questions from supporters on the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a pause for two medical emergencies in the crowd turned into a bizarre 39 minutes of music and dancing as Trump abandoned the discussion of the election to put on his favourite hits, swaying awkwardly on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?" he said, bringing the Q&A section to an abrupt end and telling his people to crank up the volume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has made a brief, jerky dance his signature at the end of rallies for years, nearly always to his exit song – the Village People's 1978 disco anthem "YMCA."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, however, he stayed on stage for nine songs, ranging from opera to Guns N' Roses and Elvis, with the ex-president alternating his dance moves with standing in place and staring into the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hope he's okay," Harris opined dryly on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undeterred, Trump was bopping to the Village People again on Tuesday at a rally in Atlanta, where he turned up 90 minutes late and didn't mention the previous night's events or the criticism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering his usual stump speech focusing on illegal immigration, Trump pushed his now-customary falsehoods and exaggerations about migrant crime in Colorado and Ohio and referred to the country as "occupied" by foreign criminals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But if he was trying to draw a line under Monday's strangeness, he didn't succeed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump called the two world wars "beautiful" and claimed to have invented the word "caravan." Explaining how he was going to make America great again, he lurched into an aside about his wealthy friends, beachwear and President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a lot of rich friends. They go here. They go there. They're boring as hell," he began, apropos of nothing in particular. "Nobody cares. They put on their bathing suit. They don't look a lot better than Biden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris and Trump are locked in a dead heat, according to polls, and the election is set to be decided by seven swing states where the margins could come down to a few thousand votes each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican is the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate that sparked fears about his own age.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has not released a recent comprehensive report on his state of health, prompting fierce criticism from Harris, 59, who has increasingly been homing in on Trump's age and physical and mental condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the topic of her closing argument as she sat down with popular radio host Charlamagne tha God in an effort to boost her messaging to black male voters – a part of the electorate where Trump has made gains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After setting out her policies for improving the lives of African American men, she turned to Trump's rallies and repeated a claim that riled him during their September debate – that bored supporters were leaving his rallies early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This man is weak and he is unfit," Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump had begun the day with a less freewheeling tone at an Economic Club of Chicago event, where he said he was for slapping "obnoxious" tariffs on trading partners like Mexico so that companies move factories to the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff," Trump said. (AFP)

    Hong Kong cuts duty on hard liquor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Duty on spirits has been reduced to help promote the liquor trade, Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The government has made reference to the successful experience of driving the wine trade through exemption of wine duty and will, starting today, reduce the duty rate for liquor with an import price of over HK$200 from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move applies to liquor with an alcoholic strength of more than 30 percent, and the duty on spirits with an import price of HK$200 or below remains unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, industry representatives had called for a reduction in the duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the cut will boost the development of high value added industries including tourism and logistics and storage, as well as high-end food and beverage consumption.

    Govt sets sights on developing low-altitude economy
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is looking to kick-start Hong Kong’s low-altitude economy by launching a new working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services from transporting goods and people, to assisting in rescue work and providing high-resolution surveys.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said “formulating a management system for low-altitude economy will help drive development in areas such as telecommunication technologies, AI and the digital industry, unlocking the low-altitude airspace as a new production factor for our economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group will be led by the deputy financial secretary and focus on kick-starting projects with good prospects, as well as develop broader strategies and action plans, and work out regulatory issues and infrastructure needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be tasked with launching pilot projects to explore the best applications – including drones for delivery, surveys, building maintenance, aerial photography, performances as well as for search and rescue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many mainland cities have been working to develop low-altitude economies – encompassing services like delivery drones or flying taxis and other aerial vehicles within airspace below 1,000 metres – and Hong Kong has been under pressure to keep up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another group led by the deputy chief secretary will bring various government departments together, and leverage community efforts to identify and develop “tourist hotspots of high popularity and with strong appeal in various districts”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other groups will focus on promoting the “integrated development” of education, technology and talents, and accelerate the development of the “silver industry” to help meet the daily needs of the elderly.

    John Lee starts Policy Address with call for change

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee started his third Policy Address on Wednesday morning with a call to embrace change, noting Beijing’s support for Hong Kong’s development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sporting a green tie designed by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University showcasing Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, Lee opened his speech at the Legislative Council by noting the resolution adopted at the third plenum of the Communist Party in July to further deepen reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Resolution calls on Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ while consolidating and enhancing its status aas an international hub for high-calibre talents, to exert a greater role in our country’s opening up to the world, and to deepen collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area through better harmonisation of rules and mechanisms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said from the time he was running for the top job, he has been emphasising the need to embrace reform, and had put in place a series of measures to tackle issues such as enhancing district services, cutting waiting times for public housing, and addressing intergenerational poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that we must maintain our development momentum and self-renewal, and that we must embrace changes while staying principled, innovative and flexible in meeting challenges and opportunities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE had earlier said his latest policy blueprint will focus on lifting the economy and on livelihood issues. The official theme for the address is “Reform for Enhancing Development and Building Our Future Together.”

 President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States. This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world," Xi said in remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National Committee on US-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi pointed out that China-US relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world, which have a bearing on the future and destiny of mankind, according to the letter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has always handled China-US relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and has always believed that the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other," Xi said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's government warned on Wednesday against "escalation" on the Korean peninsula, after North Korea blew up sections of deeply symbolic roads and railways connecting it to the South.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "These North Korean activities could increase tensions between the South and the North, and it is important that this does not lead to an escalation," said Kazuhiko Aoki, deputy chief cabinet secretary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North blew up the roads and railways on Tuesday, Seoul's military said, adding it had conducted a "counter-fire" operation in response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang's military last week vowed to permanently seal its southern border after spending months laying mines and building anti-tank barriers in the wake of leader Kim Jong-un declaring the South his country's "principal enemy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North also accused Seoul of using drones to drop anti-regime propaganda leaflets on the capital Pyongyang, with Kim convening a security meeting to direct a plan of "immediate military action" in response, state media reported Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government will do its utmost to collect, analyse and monitor necessary information on future developments in North Korea," Aoki told a regular briefing in Tokyo. (AFP)

    Trump's crypto platform falters on first day of sales

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former US president Donald Trump's cryptocurrency platform had a faltering sales launch on Tuesday, with only a fraction of its digital tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Republican candidate announced in mid-September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch the platform named World Liberty Financial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 20 billion digital tokens, priced at 1.5 cents each, were offered by the company – a total value of US$300 million – but just three percent had been purchased by Tuesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tokens can be used as cryptocurrencies and give buyers a vote on the platform's governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many observers blamed the low sales on technical problems, as the company's website suffered outages earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Liberty Financial will enable users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies to or from one another, a service already offered by many platforms, one of the best-known of which is Aave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, presenting himself as a "pro-bitcoin president" if elected in November. (AFP)

    Tuchel set to be unveiled as new England manager

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel is set to be named England's new manager after agreeing a deal with the Football Association (FA), multiple British and German media outlets reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Times, Sky Sports, the BBC and German newspaper Bild said that Tuchel, 51, will be named as the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee Carsley was put in temporary charge of England in August following Southgate's resignation shortly after losing the final of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FA declined to comment on the reports but said that CEO Mark Bullingham will provide an update on Wednesday at Wembley Stadium when the appointment is expected to be confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German, who has been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season, would become just the third foreign manager of the Three Lions after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky Germany reported he will sign an 18-month deal from January 1, 2025 until the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former coach of Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern, Tuchel has the trophy-winning pedigree that the FA is seeking to help end a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the move has drawn criticism over the FA's unwillingness to trust an English coach with its top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off. (AFP)

    Brady to become part-owner of NFL's Las Vegas Raiders

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady was approved as a member of the Las Vegas Raiders ownership group on Tuesday by NFL team owners.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brady, who played 23 NFL seasons before retiring in 2022, will hold a 5 percent stake in the Raiders, who are off to a 2-4 start this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The approval at an owners meeting in Atlanta ends an 18-month saga since the first reports of Brady seeking a share of the partnership group that owns the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delays in the deal reportedly included figuring out an exact percentage for Brady and issues around his current role as an NFL television analyst for Fox Sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two months ago, the NFL put some restrictions on Brady's broadcast access because of his possible involvement with the Raiders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brady is banned from attending in-person or online broadcast production meetings and is not allowed access to players, coaches or team facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While he is permitted to broadcast Raiders contests, Brady must follow NFL rules banning criticism of other teams or officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brady, 47, spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, leading them to six NFL titles, and captured his last crown with Tampa Bay in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He set NFL career records with 7,753 completions from 12,050 attempts for 89,214 yards and 649 touchdowns. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The interview will offer Kamala Harris an opportunity to make her case to his followers, as she works to shore up support with male voters and black men in particular. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774656_1_20241015232757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris could sit down for an interview with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, whose audience leans heavily towards young men, as she works to shore up support with male voters, sources said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the final stretch of the US presidential campaign, Harris campaign officials met with Rogan's team this week but an appearance has not been confirmed yet, said two of the sources, who have knowledge of the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rogan, who runs the most popular podcast in the United States, has a highly coveted and devoted following that numbers in the tens of millions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The interview will offer Harris an opportunity to make her case to his followers, as she works to shore up support with male voters and black men in particular. Numerous public polls suggest Republican nominee Donald Trump could outperform among young men of all races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris has recently lost ground in particular among black men, a key demographic that helped Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020, and on Monday she launched a new economic plan to court them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her "opportunity agenda" is designed to give them "tools to achieve financial freedom, lower costs to better provide for themselves and their families, and protect their rights," her campaign said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her campaign is also ramping up outreach to the typically Democratic voting group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare move, Harris on Wednesday will sit for an interview with Fox News – to reach out to undecided right-leaning voters put off by the former president and counter Republican claims that she is avoiding media scrutiny.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fox News' day-to-day programming is heavy on conservative punditry that often explicitly supports Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Trump said he also plans to go on Joe Rogan's podcast before Election Day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump and Rogan have sparred in the past. As recently as August, Trump took a shot at Rogan on his social media platform Truth Social but later called him a "good guy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Rogan said he is not a Trump supporter and in August said he preferred Robert F Kennedy Jr, for president. Kennedy has since dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors assessed a series of earnings reports, and with chipmaker equities weakening on news the United States may introduce export curbs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones slumped 0.8 percent to 42,740, as did the S&P 500 to 5,815.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq retreated 1.0 percent to 18,315.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks saw a mixed performance at the start of the day, with traders responding mostly positively to earnings reports, but eventually they lost ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chipmakers in particular struggled as markets reacted to reports that President Joe Biden's administration was considering a cap on exports of advanced AI chips to some countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dutch tech giant ASML, which supplies chip-making machines to the semiconductor industry, also saw its shares dive in Europe after unveiling a cut to its 2025 guidance and seeing a disappointing slump in sales bookings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The selloff is because of ASML suggesting that demand is not as strong" as anticipated for chips and AI, said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ASML mentioned that demand is down from China. That's one of the biggest markets. There's chatter that the US government could start perhaps curbing chip sales even more," Krosby added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, ASML shares plunged 16.3 percent in the United States, while chip titan Nvidia lost 4.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AMD, another major chip company, was down 5.2 percent. (AFP)

    Conker champion investigated for cheating

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Conker Championships said on Tuesday it was investigating allegations of cheating after this year's men’s winner was found to have a steel chestnut in his pocket.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 200 enthusiasts of the traditional game entered the annual competition on Sunday in the small village of Southwick in central England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game involves players using conkers – the glossy brown seeds from the horse chestnut tree – threaded onto a string to try and smash their opponent’s chestnut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each player takes three alternate strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran player Dave Jakins, 82, won the men's tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But organisers said they launched an investigation after claims that he may have used a steel chestnut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The allegations were raised by Alastair Johnson-Ferguson, who lost in the men’s final against Jakins after his conker “disintegrated in one hit," The Telegraph newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers confirmed a steel conker was found in Jakins' pocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigations were ongoing, but they said that it appeared unlikely that he was able to cheat under the scrutiny of judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jakins has denied the allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He was very closely watched by four judges. It looks like it was absolutely impossible for him to cheat,” St. John Burkett, chair of the event's organising committee, told Sky News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The title of World Conker Champion went this year to Kelci Banschbach, originally from Indianapolis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old was crowned “queen conker” after beating Jakins in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was the first American to win the title since the World Conker Championships began in 1965. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China unveiled an ambitious mid to long-term development plan for its space science programme on Tuesday, which will guide the country's space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The programme, the first of its kind at the national level, was jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the China National Space Administration and the China Manned Space Agency at a press conference on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It outlines the development goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, as well as a three-phase roadmap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five key scientific themes include the extreme universe, space-time ripples, the panoramic view of the Sun and Earth, the search for habitable planets, and the study biological and physical sciences in space. This includes examining black holes and finding signs of extraterrestrial life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our country’s space science research in general is still in an initial stage,” Ding Chibiao, a vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s a weakness that must be addressed on the path of building an aerospace power.”

 Organisers on Tuesday confirmed that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka will compete in the Hong Kong Open tennis championships later in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Osaka, who won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021 and the US Open in 2018 and 2020, is the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam and the first player from Asia to hold the singles' top ranking, claiming the World No. 1 spot in January 2019, which she held for 21 weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will be joined by Russia's Diana Shnaider and Anastasia Potapova, who is ranked 37th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-year-old Shnaider is the youngest player currently ranked in the world's top 16, and has won three titles this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the 2024 Olympic Games, she partnered with Mirra Andreeva to capture the silver medal in the women's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other international stars already confirmed to compete in the event include defending champion Leylah Fernandez of Canada, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1 Simona Halep of Romania and Britain's highest-ranked player Katie Boulter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Paris Olympic mixed doubles silver medalist Wang Xinyu, and rising stars Yuan Yue and Wang Xiyu will also feature in the field competing for a total prize purse worth US$250,000. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel has issued military evacuation orders affecting more than a quarter of the country, the UN refugee agency said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figures underscore the heavy price Lebanese are paying as Israel steps up its campaign to defeat Hezbollah and destroy its infrastructure in their one-year conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN refugee agency's Middle East Director Rema Jamous Imseis told a press briefing in Geneva that new Israeli evacuation orders to 20 villages in southern Lebanon meant that over a quarter of the country was now affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are heeding these calls to evacuate, and they're fleeing with almost nothing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli strikes have killed at least 2,309 people over the last year, the Lebanese government said, and more than 1.2 million people have been displaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The majority have been killed since late September when Israel expanded its military campaign. The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed, according to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says its operation in Lebanon aims to secure the return of tens of thousands of its residents forced to flee their homes in northern Israel due to Hezbollah attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Tuesday, Hezbollah said it had launched a barrage of rockets towards the northern Israeli city of Haifa, adding it was "in defence of Lebanon and its people" and in response to Israeli attacks on cities, villages and civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel expanded its bombing campaign in Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 22 people - most of them women - in an airstrike in the north on a house where displaced people were seeking refuge from Israeli strikes further south, health officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue workers were still pulling bodies out of the rubble in Aitou on Tuesday, local media reported, following one of the deadliest strikes on displaced families in Lebanon, after strikes earlier this month on the southern Lebanese town of Ain Deleb that left more than 30 dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has not commented on the Aitou strike, but has repeatedly said it takes all possible precautions to avoid civilian casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far the main focus of Israel's military operations in Lebanon has been in the Bekaa Valley in the east, the suburbs of Beirut, and in the south, where UN peacekeepers have said that Israeli fire has hit their bases on numerous occasions and wounded peacekeepers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Security Council on Monday expressed strong concern after several peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon again came under fire amid clashes between the Israeli military and Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting a military base in central Israel where four soldiers were killed on Sunday by a Hezbollah drone strike, said Israel would continue to attack the movement "without mercy, everywhere in Lebanon – including Beirut".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah resumed a year ago when the militant group began firing rockets at Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Middle East remains on high alert for Israel to retaliate against Iran for an October 1 barrage of missiles launched in response to Israel's assaults on Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu's office said Israel would listen to the United States but would decide its actions according to its own national interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement was attached to a Washington Post article which said Netanyahu had told President Joe Biden's administration that Israel would strike Iranian military, not nuclear or oil, targets - suggesting a more limited counterstrike aimed at preventing a full-scale war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar's emir accused Israel on Tuesday of exploiting "international inaction" on the Middle East crisis to move beyond its "aggression" in Gaza to build more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and send troops into Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar, the United States and Egypt have repeatedly mediated in an attempt to end the war in Gaza, which broke out a year ago when fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas burst into Israel from Gaza and killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's offensive has killed more than 42,000 people in Gaza, turned the enclave into piles of cement and twisted metal and created severe shortages of food, water and fuel. (Agencies)

    SCO summit to boost economic opportunities: expert

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Regional leaders on Tuesday arrived in Pakistan's capital Islamabad to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Security in the city is tight for the 23rd SCO summit, with Pakistan deploying 10,000 security personnel, including the army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SCO is the world's largest regional bloc in terms of geographic scope, and covers more than 40 percent of the world's population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, CEO of the Asian Institute of Eco-Civilisation Research and Development, said enhancing economic opportunities will be high on the summit's agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is creating economic linkages through trade and establishing special economic zones," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last few years, China has increased its trade with SCO members, it's around US$383 billion right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another topic that will likely top the agenda, according to Ramay, is regional cooperation to combat terrorism, which has been a big issue for host Pakistan, with the country suffering the recent deadly attacks in Karachi in early October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramay also said that more countries, like Saudi Arabia, are looking to join the SCO, but he underscored the difference between the SCO and other regional groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SCO is a partnership organisation, not an alliance or a bloc, like BRICS, thus leaves it more to its members to decide to what extent they want to enhance cooperation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, ahead of the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sharif and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under the Belt and Road Initiative.

 Police said dozens of turtles were stolen from an industrial building in Tsuen Wan on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers received a report at 10am that the front door of a unit had been forced open and there were signs the interior had been ransacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They estimated about 50 eastern box turtles were missing.
  <br/>

    North Korea blows up roads connected to the South

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People watch a news report on North Korea blowing up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774615_1_20241015165124.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In a symbolic display of anger, North Korea on Tuesday blew up the northern section of unused roads that once linked it with the South, with the rivals exchanging threats days after the North claimed that its rival flew drones over its capital Pyongyang.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The roads’ choreographed demolition underlines North Korea’s growing anger against South Korea’s conservative government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to sever relations with South Korea and abandon the goal of achieving peaceful Korean unification.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observers say it’s unlikely Kim will launch a preemptive, large-scale attack on South Korea because of fear that an almost certain massive retaliation by the more superior forces of the United States and South Korea would threaten Pyongyang's survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the explosions, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said its military fired within southern sections of the border as it bolstered its readiness and surveillance posture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement did not give details, but the move could have been an attempt to avert cross-border fire by North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn't immediately known whether North Korea responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles affairs with North Korea, separately condemned the North’s detonations as a “highly abnormal” and “regressive” measure that violates previous inter-Korean agreements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video provided by South Korea’s military showed a cloud of white and grey smoke emerging from the explosion at a road near the western border town of Kaesong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korean trucks and excavators could be seen clearing out debris. Another video showed smoke emerging from a coastal road near the eastern border. (AP)

    Gym chain customers urged to be wary of new deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged former members of the now-defunct gym chain Physical Fitness to think carefully before signing a new agreement with perFIT, the operator who took over the business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gym chain is offering former Physical Fitness members free access to reopened locations in Mong Kok and Wan Chai, along with any remaining private training sessions they had paid for, provided that they sign an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the clauses state that the free period only lasts for up to three years and there will be a monthly fee afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consent form also requires members to grant perFIT access to their previous contracts and personal information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief executive, GIlly Wong, said about 10 percent of complaints regarding the closing down of Physical Fitness involved losses exceeding HK$100,000, adding that those affected should consider their personal situation and legal rights before deciding whether to sign the consent form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously we spotted that because of the diverse range of packages, classes, terms, expiry period of membership, the situation of every individual could be quite different. But in general, for those with shorter terms and also lesser amount, it’s more easy for them to accept the new proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On the other hand, for those customers who have a bigger amount with a much longer duration and have many private classes, that may require review on every individual,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said the council will continue to hold talks with perFIT and work on a mutually agreeable solution for everyone involved.

    Keep an eye out for 'shrinkflation': watchdog
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774588_2_20241015143038.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged consumers to stay vigilant when shopping in supermarkets, noting retailers are taking advantage of downsized products to effect price hikes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it surveyed 62 supermarket products, including food, daily necessities and pet food with volume or weight changes over the past 3.5 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that nearly all of them had seen weight or volume reduction ranging from about one percent to as much as 30 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 40 percent of products showed a de facto price increase, with the highest reaching 26.2 percent based on the average per-unit recommended retail price, the council noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong said while it is reasonable for retailers to seek profit-making measures, they should also be fair to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because usually for this kind of little change, consumers may not easily spot it except you follow the product for a long, long time. You are so loyal to that, then you follow," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, when there's a modest change, like this time, [a drop of] only three grams of instant noodle or maybe 20 grams of body lotion, it's really hard for consumers to keep track of that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that while some countries, like South Korea, have implemented legislation to increase transparency regarding changes in product size, such as listing the unit price, this may not be the optimal solution for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reason is Hong Kong is a very open market. We import a lot of products worldwide. We don't have our self-production that much. So, if we ask the government to legislate according to what other markets have been doing right now, we have to consider whether it is the most effective measure," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council advised consumers to pay close attention to a product's volume or weight, and compare products using unit pricing, if they want to objectively assess their expenses.

 The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged people to select beauty products carefully after it found inconsistencies in some products boasting vitamin C content.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it tested 17 serums and 10 of them had a lower concentration of vitamin C than the manufacturer claimed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While one actually had more vitamin C than advertised, another one had none whatsoever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said they have referred their findings to the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have already shared this report to the Customs and Excise Department. So if there is any alleged infringement of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, they would take an independent enforcement action on that,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog urged manufacturers to improve their labelling practices, noting that five of the products tested failed to list the vitamin C concentration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the label for one serum didn't mention an expiry date, while six others didn't have a list of ingredients in either English or Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council also discovered that seven of the serums contained fragrance allergens with restricted use in the EU, saying eczema sufferers or individuals with allergies could develop contact dermatitis or rashes from overexposure to the products.

    Officials getting to the bottom of monkey deaths: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that officials need to make sure that parts of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens are properly sealed off, following the deaths of nine monkeys there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials have been investigating the mysterious deaths, as they held a meeting on Monday chaired by Kevin Yeung, the culture, sports and tourism minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee told reporters that officials need to focus on several things, and one of them is ensuring the affected area of the zoo doesn't expand further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The relevant section has been closed off. Disinfection has been conducted. So we have contained the area," he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second step is to control. Apart from the cleaning and disinfection, we have to continue monitoring the situation to ensure that the problem will not spread."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said autopsies, tests and toxicology analyses should be completed as soon as possible so that experts can find out the reasons behind the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers need to wear protective gear properly, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said Yeung is in charge of the issue, and officials will provide an update once there is a new development.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the number of mainland visitors during the recent Golden Week holiday showed a "good increase".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Talking to reporters ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said 1.22 million visitors came to Hong Kong during the holiday period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was up 27 percent compared with the Golden Week last year, and it was also an increase of 13 percent compared with the Golden Week in May," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were... over 1,000 mainland tourist groups visiting Hong Kong. The actual figure is 1,050. Eighty percent of these tour groups actually stayed overnight."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing industry figures, the chief executive said restaurants saw increased turnover during the week, as they also benefited from events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The catering business was doing quite well because the association indicated that there was about 2 billion dollars of business during Golden Week, which was a five percent increase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A lot of representatives of different sectors and businesses have indicated that during the Golden Week, there were larger numbers of visitors, customers, and also there was an increase in the business turnover."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the National Day fireworks display attracted over 330,000 people, and about 190,000 movie-goers took advantage of half-price tickets that day, up 22 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said 60,000 people visited museums and art spaces managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department on October 1, when admission was free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that 4.43 million people also enjoyed free or discounted journeys that day on a number of modes of transport.

    Li Qiang inaugurates Beijing-funded Pakistan airport

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After arriving in Islamabad, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's capital was under strict security lockdown as Li landed in the city ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the premiers held delegation-level talks. Sharif's office said that he and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They both also inaugurated virtually the CPEC-funded Gwadar International Airport in southwestern Balochistan province in a ceremony telecast live by Pakistan's state run TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li hailed the new international airport as a vivid illustration of the special friendship between China and Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and Pakistani leaders, the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership has been continuously deepened, and the China-Pakistan ironclad friendship, which has stood the test of changes in the international situation, is unbreakable, Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Premier also met with the country's top military officials including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Army Sahir Shamshad Mirza, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and Pakistan have always respected and supported each other, Li said that the two countries are good brothers and good partners who have stood the test of the changing international landscape and truly shared weal and woe and helped each other.

    Green Policy Address cover shows sustainability: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that carrying out reforms together is among the themes of this year's Policy Address, which he will deliver on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the cover of the blueprint's hard copy will be in green again, because this reflects the sustainability of government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that the colour can also mean harmony, vitality and prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that everybody's very keen to know about the content of the Policy Address. The theme of the Policy Address is we will reform for enhancing development and building our future together," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that there will be a supplement in place of a document on policies implemented in the past couple of years, which he hopes people don't overlook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's predecessor, Carrie Lam, introduced supplements for her blueprint in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lee said new amendments that Beijing and local officials signed as part of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) last week didn't come easy, as he once again thanked the central government for making it happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the idea to amend the agreements, which cover various service industries, was led by the Ministry of Commerce and was backed by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.

    Two pandas depart China for US capital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Giant Panda statues are seen at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774560_1_20241015110842.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two giant pandas on Tuesday departed the mainland for a zoo in the US capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bao Li, a male panda, and female Qing Bao, both three years old, were headed to the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington under a decade-long breeding and research agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and the United States have made orderly arrangements... to ensure that the two giant pandas will arrive at the Washington National Zoo safely and smoothly," the China Wildlife Conservation Association said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu Yongbin, party secretary of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda committee, said at the farewell ceremony in Sichuan that the new round of China-US cooperation will boost bilateral collaboration in endangered species and biodiversity protection and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and American people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bao Li and Qing Bao were accompanied by an experienced breeder and a veterinarian to help them adapt quickly to their new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only a few of the beloved black-and-white bears remain in the US after almost all were returned to China in recent years under pre-arranged contracts – including all three of the National Zoo's pandas last November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping said after meeting his counterpart Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In August, San Diego Zoo welcomed two new giant pandas, the first to be sent by the nation to the US in 21 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anticipation for the pandas' arrival in Washington was high, with the National Zoo's website emblazoned with a banner that read: "The pandas are coming."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Something "giant" is "coming to Washington", the zoo said in a post on X, adding that it would be closed on Tuesday but that for "the safety of the pandas and staff, we will not disclose any additional timing".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Preparations were well underway at the zoo, where pandas have been star attractions for decades. Renovations have been undertaken at the panda habitat "to enhance the safety of the facilities and maximise space for the bears to roam", according to the zoo's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new structures constructed for the pandas include shallow pools to allow them to bathe and bamboo stands that require the bears to mimic the foraging techniques they would use in the wild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bears will not, however, be available to the public for more than a month after their arrival, as they will need to be quarantined and to acclimate to their new habitat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While en route, the pandas' in-flight meals will include bamboo shoots, carrots and Chinese cornbread, the China Wildlife Conservation Association said. (AFP/Xinhua)

    Australia vows ban on some swipe and tap surcharges

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia took aim at firms charging consumers for tap or bankcard payments on Tuesday, targeting "hefty" fees in a billion-dollar industry dominated by Visa and Mastercard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's centre-left government said it would "ban debit card surcharges" from 2026 and work to lower the cost of other types of electronic payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australians now use cash for less than 16 percent of transactions, spelling boom times for electronic payment providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They take a cut of almost every transaction, charging retailers a fee of between one and two percent to run each payment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's central bank estimates merchants paid more than US$4 billion in transaction fees from 2022-2023 alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many small shops pass along these costs to the consumer. But some larger companies – such as global retail chains – are often able to negotiate substantial discounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have said it was determined to bring costs down and to stop small vendors from being gouged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers shouldn't be punished for using cards or digital payments, and at the same time, small businesses shouldn't have to pay hefty fees just to get paid themselves," said economy minister Jim Chalmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, Visa and Mastercard this year agreed to limit transaction fees and pay US$30 billion to end an anti-trust investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A court has since threatened to reject that deal as overgenerous to Visa and Mastercard. The European Union has longstanding caps on fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Credit and debit card companies have previously warned that regulation would mean less competitive markets and only mask the cost for consumers. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Captain Ben Stokes was named in the England team for the second Test against Pakistan starting in Multan on Tuesday after recovering from a hamstring injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stokes suffered the injury two months ago and missed the three-match home series against Sri Lanka and last week's first Test, which the visitors won by an innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durham seamer Matthew Potts also returns to the side for the first time since the Lord's Test against Sri Lanka at the end of August. Seamers Gus Atkinson and Chris Woakes are rested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Look, it's obviously got to be sensible," said talismanic all-rounder Stokes on Monday after he was declared fit, having been bowling in the nets since before the first Test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm obviously playing as a third seamer," he added. "I'm available to bowl and obviously when I sense the time is right for me to maybe come on and make an impact there won't be any doubts in my mind that I can come on and bowl."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England won the first Test, also in Multan, by an innings and 47 runs on Friday, with Ollie Pope leading the side in Stokes's absence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England rode on a brilliant 317 from Harry Brook and 262 from Joe Root for a stunning victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan became the first team in Test cricket's 147-year history to lose by an innings after posting a 550-plus total in their first knock. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Vientos smashed a grand slam and Francisco Lindor homered as well as the New York Mets beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 on Monday to level their Major League Baseball playoff series at one game apiece.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vientos's four-run home run in a determined second inning at-bat helped the Mets rebound from a 9-0 drubbing in game one on Sunday in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lindor led off the game with a 395-foot home run off Dodgers hurler Ryan Brasier, ending the Dodgers pitching staff's record-equalling streak of 33 scoreless innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dodgers hurlers hadn't surrendered a run since the second inning of game three of their division series against the San Diego Padres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One inning later, Vientos got the better of Dodgers reliever Landon Knack, fouling off five pitches before crushing the ninth pitch he saw – a 95 mph fastball – over the center field seats for a grand slam home run that pushed the Mets' lead to 6-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starling Marte had opened the inning with a single off Knack and scored on Tyrone Taylor's double that left runners at second and third. Lindor was intentionally walked to load the bases and bring up Vientos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old admitted he "took it personally" when the Dodgers walked Lindor to bring him to the plate but said he "wasn't trying to do too much."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mets will host games three and four on Wednesday and Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're in a great spot," Vientos said. "I like the momentum we got. I like the energy we brought in this day game and we've got to keep it going.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Max Muncy hit a solo homer for Los Angeles in the fifth, but the Dodgers' vaunted lineup was largely silenced. Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts and two walks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner of the series will advance to the World Series against either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Yankees, fueled by home runs from Giancarlo Stanton and Juan Soto, beat the Guardians 5-2 to open their American League Championship Series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland pitcher Alex Cobb walked three of the next five batters before he was replaced by Joey Cantillo, who threw a couple of wild pitches into the dirt against the next two Yankees batters, allowing Aaron Judge and Stanton to score for a 3-0 New York lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yankees, owners of 27 World Series titles, are chasing their first appearance in a World Series since they beat Philadelphia for the crown in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guardians are seeking their first World Series appearance since 2016 and their first title since 1948. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Russian court on Monday sentenced a French researcher to three years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of breaching a "foreign agent" law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trial of Laurent Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO, comes amid tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 48-year-old was arrested in Moscow in June and charged with gathering information on Russia's military without being registered as a "foreign agent".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Natalya Cheprasova at Moscow's Zamoskvoretsky district court ruled that Vinatier was guilty and sentenced him to three years in a penal colony, two years less than the maximum possible sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Pavel Mamonov told journalists: "We consider the sentence harsh and will definitely appeal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Frenchman had acknowledged violating Russian law, saying he was unaware he should have registered as a "foreign agent".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor had requested a sentence of three years and three months, saying Vinatier "repented" but the case involved "significant threats connected to Russia's security".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another lawyer for Vinatier, Oleg Bessonov, had asked the judge to issue him with a fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron had demanded Vinatier's release, saying the "propaganda" against him "does not match reality".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vinatier was charged over a requirement introduced in 2022 that people who gather information on Russia's military and arms that could harm the country's national security, must register as "foreign agents".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions between Moscow and Paris are running high after France charged Russian-born Telegram founder Pavel Durov in August over illegal content on the popular social media platform, with the Kremlin warning against "political persecution". (AFP)

    India, Canada expel top envoys

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New Delhi said it was withdrawing its six diplomats from Canada, but Ottawa said it had served them notices of expulsion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 India and Canada each expelled the other's ambassador and five other top diplomats, after New Delhi said its envoy had been named among "persons of interest" following the killing of a Sikh separatist leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New Delhi said it was withdrawing its six diplomats from Canada, but Ottawa said it had served them notices of expulsion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Subsequent to those notices, India announced it would withdraw its officials," a statement from the Canadian foreign ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2023 murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar crashed the country's diplomatic relations with India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were "credible allegations" linking Indian intelligence services to the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expulsion of the diplomats -- including the most senior envoys on both sides -- is a major escalation in the row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India "decided to expel" Ottawa's acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler, his deputy and four first secretaries, ordering they leave before midnight on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ottawa announced similar measures in return, with Canadian police saying they had "evidence pertaining to agents of the government of India's involvement in serious criminal activity" in Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said that India had refused to cooperate in the investigation, or to lift diplomatic immunity for its envoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision to expel these individuals was made with great consideration and only after the RCMP gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case," she said in a statement, referring to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder, which took place in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023. (AFP)

    NASA probe Europa Clipper lifts off for Jupiter's moon

    <![CDATA[<img alt="NASA probe is set to reach Europa, one of Jupiter's many moons, in five and a half years. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774510_1_20241015025222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NASA probe Europa Clipper lifted off from the US Kennedy Space Center on Monday, bound for an icy moon of Jupiter to discover whether it has the ingredients to support life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lift-off took place aboard SpaceX's powerful Falcon Heavy rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe is set to reach Europa, one of Jupiter's many moons, in five and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission will allow the US space agency to uncover new details about Europa, which scientists believe could hold an ocean beneath its iced-over surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With Europa Clipper, we're not searching for life on Europa, but we're trying to see if this ocean world is habitable, and that means we're looking for the water," said NASA official Gina DiBraccio, ahead of the launch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're looking for energy sources, and we're really looking for the chemistry there, so that we can understand what habitable environments might be throughout our whole universe," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If life's ingredients are found, another mission would then have to make the journey to try and detect it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe is the largest ever designed by NASA for interplanetary exploration. Europa Clipper is 30 metres wide when its immense solar panels -- designed to capture the weak light that reaches Jupiter -- are fully extended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission will look to determine the structure and composition of Europa's surface, its depth, and even the salinity of its ocean, as well as the way the two interact -- to find out, for example, if water rises to the surface in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aim is to understand whether the three ingredients necessary for life are present: water, energy and certain chemical compounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If these conditions exist on Europa, life could be found in the ocean in the form of primitive bacteria, explained Bonnie Buratti, the mission's deputy project scientist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the bacteria would likely be too deep for the Europa Clipper to see.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe will cover 2.9 billion kilometres during its journey, with arrival expected in April 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main mission will last another four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe will make 49 close flybys over Europa, coming as close as 25 kilometres above the surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 4,000 people have been working on the US$5.2 billion mission for around a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NASA says the investment is justified by the importance of the data that will be collected. (AFP)
