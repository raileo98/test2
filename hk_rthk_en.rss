<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department on Thursday ordered contractors linked to a fatal accident at the Kai Tak Sports Park to suspend the use of an elevating work platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the construction worker, 52, was trapped between the platform and a metal structure as he was inspecting on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said officials immediately started an on-site investigation once they were notified about the accident, and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned to suspend the use of the platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The contractors cannot resume the work until the department is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added it would complete a probe into the case as soon as possible, find out if any party was liable and take legal actions if necessary, while recommending improvement measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was saddened by the death and expressed its deepest sympathy to his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The worker was found unconscious on Wednesday morning and was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will welcome thousands of civil aviation leaders next year to explore business possibilities and open new air routes to the SAR, as the city prepares to host a major global airline route convention for the first time in September 2025.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The event - Routes World 2025 - will be organised by the Airport Authority, in collaboration with Routes, which operates global airline and airport networking events and conferences, with a particular focus on world aviation routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a signing ceremony to mark the collaboration, Steven Small, Director of Events at Routes, expects the event will attract attendees from 150 countries and 250 airlines who seek to expand their global airline route networks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These, he noted, could bring significant economic benefits to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A typical Routes World event can exceed over US$590 million of economic impact over a three to five year period. That only can take place if it’s part of a strategic plan of growth, and Hong Kong is a fantastic example of that strategic plan,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Its location, superb infrastructure, and exciting tourism offerings means that Hong Kong international airport is already recognised as one of the best international aviation hubs globally,” Small added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Vivian Cheung, chief operating officer of the Airport Authority, noted the timing of this event is very "ideal" as the city is expected to complete the third runway expansion project by the end of this year, which will enable the city’s airport to serve 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition, we are progressing at full speed with the development of what we call ‘the airport city’ to showcase attendees the city’s enormous business potential,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airport city is an area under development that would eventually comprise entertainment, retail, and dining facilities, as well as convention and exhibition venues and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also noted the authority would take the opportunity to explore the potential for opening new long-haul flights, especially to countries involved in the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to the event in 2025, the city will also host a major aviation event — the CAPA Airline Leader Summit, Asia & Sustainability Awards — in November this year.

    'Waste charging should start in August at govt venues'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Green Earth says government departments taking part in the scheme should aim to cut waste by 10 percent within a year. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752465_1_20240509160436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A green group has suggested that Hong Kong's much-delayed waste charging scheme should begin as planned on August 1, but only at government-run premises and facilities, other than public housing estates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government earlier conceded that there are still problems with the pay-as-you-throw scheme, which has been tested at 14 locations since last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an open letter to Legco's environmental affairs panel on Thursday, the Green Earth said officials should start the first phase of the scheme in August, covering government offices, parks and public schools, among other venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Participating government departments should propose clear waste reduction targets, cutting waste by 10 percent within 12 months, while disclosing the manpower expenditure and management costs of relevant premises to the public," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also said the administration should encourage the industrial and commercial sectors, non-governmental institutions and residential estates to participate during the six-month period after the scheme takes effects, and consider offering them free designated rubbish bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On promoting the scheme, the Green Earth said authorities should consider setting up a response team to gauge public opinion and use social media to make clarifications.

    Revised helper agency rules target 'job-hopping'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Labour Department said agencies risk losing their licence if they don't comply with the revised code. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752463_1_20240509155512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday published a revised code of practice for employment agencies, partly to try to deter foreign domestic helpers (FDH) from "job-hopping".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move comes after complaints about helpers switching employers within a short period of time during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration regulations regarding changes of employer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said some of the changes will also better protect employers as consumers, such as requiring agencies to set out in agreements the fees for each service category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[They need to] clearly state whether a refund or arrangement for a replacement FDH will be provided where their services are not delivered in full, or the employment contract has been prematurely terminated by the FDH within the two-year contract period," the department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised code also bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said agencies will be at risk of losing their licence if they or their employees fail to follow the revised code.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students at Ireland's Trinity College Dublin (TCD) on Wednesday ended a five-day protest against Israel's actions in Gaza after they said their demands were met by the university.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on its website, the university said "an agreement was reached" after "successful talks between the university's senior management and the protesters".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the institution's student union, said TCD's statement was a "testament to grassroots student-staff power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCD said the university "will complete a divestment from investments in Israeli companies that have activities in the occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN blacklist in this regard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters had demanded the university end any relationships it had with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security staff had closed the campus gates -- which are usually open to the public -- during the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student activists began their action last Friday as a "solidarity encampment with Palestine" echoing similar protests in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pro-Palestinian protests have rocked US campuses for weeks, spreading to countries in Europe as well as Australia. (AFP)

    Hospital Authority Convention to be held next week

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said more than 7,000 medical professionals will gather at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for an annual conference next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 160 speakers will share their views on telemedicine, smart hospitals and artificial intelligence during the HA Convention on May 16 and 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Loletta So, who chairs the convention’s scientific programme committee, said this year's edition will be the largest ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the scale, it’s actually much larger than last year. I think it’s more than last year. And it’s actually the highest number of all the previous years. So it’s going to be a very big meeting for us,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We mainly focus on the core values of the HA, which is about the people-centred care, professional service, etc. Another main point is about the innovation in our healthcare. So we have something like artificial intelligence, and then we have the telehealth and smart initiatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Hospital will also report on its latest developments regarding new innovation technologies, such as using artificial intelligence to detect strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Samuel Lam, a neurosurgery consultant at the hospital, said the technology saves time for doctors because they don't have to go through image scans one by one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will help us to streamline the whole workflow. For example, when the AI software identifies those high-risk patients, then the intervention team will be alerted immediately in the fastest way," he said.

    Stock market rebound helps more IPO listings: HKEX

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.

 China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports in April surged 8.4 percent – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports from the United States jumped by nine percent, while exports fell by nearly three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$72.35 billion from US$58.55 billion in March. (Agencies)

    Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's best friend: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The friendship between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia has blossomed since SAR officials visited the Middle Eastern country two years ago, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Capital Markets Forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong and Saudi bourses, Wong said the two territories are discussing an investment promotion and protection deal and a number of organisations have signed memoranda of understanding on issues ranging from dispute avoidance and resolution to artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pointed out that the SAR provides a fundraising platform for Saudi Arabian businesses to expand, serves as a springboard to access the mainland Chinese market, and offers opportunities to allocate offshore renminbi assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong stressed that the SAR and Saudi Arabia can help each other achieve their "ambitious goals in finance and well beyond".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Saudi Arabia has clear and ambitious goals for the development of its financial markets, and it's cultivating a diversified and efficient financial sector that contributes to realising the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, meanwhile, is an international financial centre, with a highly open and internationalised market and a regulatory regime that is aligned with major overseas markets. We adopt the best practices in the world... With our advanced capital markets, Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's partner and best friend."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed that the SAR administration is considering setting up an economic and trade office in Saudi Arabia, and that Cathay Pacific will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh in the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Bonnie Chan, told the same event that the SAR and Saudi Arabia have been working closely together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKEX has been playing its role by building more connectivity between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital markets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have signed a [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Tadawul Group. We have added the Saudi exchange as one of our recognised stock exchanges. We listed the world's largest and Asia's first Saudi ETF on our markets, an important first step in enabling Hong Kong investors to get to know to the Saudi market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Minister of Investment Development in Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Khabti, said Hong Kong could be more involved in the kingdom's development, as Riyadh aims to invest US$3.2 trillion into its economy by 2030.

  "One thing that's very important is I believe we don't see enough participation from the Hong Kong financial sector and the role it can play to facilitate for China and the rest of Asia, becoming part of that beautiful story we have," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana exploited Brunson's absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm's length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana's scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday were investigating a fatal accident at Kai Tak Sports Park involving a construction worker.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, 52, was found unconscious on Wednesday morning on a platform. He was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sports park officials said they have offered their condolences to the family of the man, who was an aerial work platform operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that the contractor and sub-contractor involved will provide all the help they can to the family and will cooperate with police and Labour Department investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it was the second fatal accident in less than three months involving the same contractor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the firm should thoroughly review its safety management system in order to protect the lives of its workers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lo Wai-fung has made history by becoming the territory's first taekwondo athlete to make the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He's headed to Paris this summer in the under 68kg class because an opponent he lost to in a qualifying tournament in March was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Taekwondo Association said originally, only the two athletes who made the final of the Asian qualifier would reach the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lo, 22, is now taking the spot because Ali Reza Abbasi from the Refugee Olympic Team was deemed ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the male and female tournaments have four weight categories, with 16 fighters in each weight class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic taekwondo competition begins on August 7.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Hungary on Wednesday evening, state media said, in the last leg of his European tour after visiting France and Serbia earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Broadcaster CCTV said Xi "arrived in Budapest by special plane and began his state visit to Hungary, at the invitation of Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written speech upon his arrival, Xi said China and Hungary are good friends and good partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to pay a state visit to the beautiful country of Hungary at the gracious invitation of President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban," he said, extending heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the Hungarian government and people on behalf of the government and people of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years, the two sides have seen frequent high-level exchanges, and fruitful outcomes in Belt and Road cooperation, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we have set a fine example of building a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation," he added. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Biden warns Israel US will stop weapons supply

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden says Washington will halt all weapons to Israel if it launches a full-scale invasion of Rafah. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752409_1_20240509104320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden on Wednesday publicly warned Israel for the first time that the US would stop supplying it weapons if Israeli forces make a major invasion of Rafah, a refugee-packed city in southern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American leader's comments represent his strongest public language to date in his effort to deter an Israeli assault on Rafah while underscoring a growing rift between the US and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden acknowledged US weapons had been used by Israeli forces to kill civilians in Gaza, where the Jewish state has mounted a seven-month-old offensive aimed at destroying Hamas following its October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's campaign has so far killed at least 30,000 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres," he said when asked about 2,000-pound bombs sent to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, earlier this week called Washington's decision to delay shipments "very disappointing" although he did not believe the US would stop supplying arms to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel this week attacked Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have sought refuge, but Biden said he did not consider Israel’s strikes a full-scale invasion because they have not struck “population centres.” (Reuters)

    Nuggets' Jokic scoops third NBA MVP award

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jokic's 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league this season. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752405_1_20240509100327.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic was named NBA Most valuable Player for the third time in four seasons on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Serbian star, who won the award in 2021 and 2022, finished runner-up in the voting in 2023 but had the satisfaction of leading the Nuggets to a first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in the regular season and beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Behind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season – although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018. (AFP)

    'More full-day closures likely for ageing MTR'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former MTR engineer Gary Zhang says more closures are likely. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752402_1_20240509094723.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An MTR engineer-turned-lawmaker said on Thursday that a full-day closure of the Kwun Tong line for maintenance is essential, adding that more short-term closures are likely to be required as the network ages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gary Zhang, who worked for the corporation before entering politics, made the comments on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=951319&livetime=20240509000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme a day after the MTR announced that no trains would operate on the stretch between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that the replacement work this time has to be carried out at very high levels within the tunnel. And it's very close to the train power supply system" he told RTHK's Samantha Butler:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So therefore, it's basically technically impossible to just rely on one night of non-traffic hours to complete the job."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang added that the MTR was confident of completing the work within the allotted time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was very likely that more such closures would be required as the network's oldest routes, the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines, reach the end of their design lifespan. Zhang noted that the routes opened in the 1980s and had a design life of approximately 50 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said structural work like that being carried out on July 28 was "very critical to the railway operations safety and the reliability".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Announcing the work yesterday, the MTR said July 28 was chosen because it fell on a Sunday during the summer holiday, when usage was likely to be light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the other lines running through the four affected stations would remain open, adding that a free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid showed they remain Europe's comeback kings as Joselu's late double rescued them from the brink of elimination to reach the Champions League final with a dramatic 2-1 second-leg win over Bayern Munich at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 4-3 aggregate victory sealed Real's progress to a remarkable sixth Champions League final in 10 years and they will bid for a record-extending 15th title against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a repeat of their spectacular semi-final comeback win over Manchester City two years ago, they saw their opponents take the lead after Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies fired home a stunning strike from a counter attack in the 68th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Joselu climbed off the bench to equalise following a calamitous error from Manuel Neuer in the 88th minute and, two minutes later, he shinned a second into the Bayern goal from a cross by Antonio Ruediger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The effort was first ruled out for an apparent offside, but the goal was given following a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die," Jude Bellingham, who will play against his former club in the final, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Davies opened the scoring in spectacular fashion, cutting back on his right foot and curling an unstoppable bullet of a shot into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Real, who had dominated proceedings, piled on the pressure with Vinicius Jr tormenting the visitors down the left channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazilian glided past Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Kimmich effortlessly and created a number chances for himself and his team mates, who were denied several times by an inspired Neuer.

  The Bayern keeper looked on course to be man of the match as he weathered a storm, but with minutes remaining he fumbled a Vinicius strike from the edge of the box to gift Joselu the equaliser.

  <br/>
  The goal recharged a raucous Santiago Bernabeu under their spectacular new roof and two minutes later Real worked their European magic again, snatching a deserved winner that fired the Spanish giants into another final. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, digesting another round of mixed earnings in a quarter that has seen solid but unspectacular corporate results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think that companies did a nice job of outpacing their Q1 expectations. But I did notice that earnings estimates for the year for 2024 really haven't changed much," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that companies aren't reporting "much earnings growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.4 percent at 39,056.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was flat at 5,187, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,302.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks finished little changed on Tuesday after three up days in which markets embraced Federal Reserve comments that further interest rate hikes were unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A handful of prominent earnings reports have commanded focus in a week with few major economic reports following last week's heavy calendar that included April jobs data and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Uber dropped 5.7 percent after reporting a US$654 million loss, while rival ride-hailing company Lyft jumped 7.1 percent after topping estimates, saying it sees solid demand growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also higher was Reddit, which advanced 3.9 percent as it posted a 48 percent jump in revenues to US$243 million. The social media company said higher costs were driven by expenses for its initial public offering. (AFP)

    Olympic flame arrives on French soil for Paris Games

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French rapper Jul lights the Olympic and Paralympic Torch Relays cauldron. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752374_1_20240509023403.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Olympic flame arrived on French soil on Wednesday at the port of Marseille on board a 19th century ship in front of 150,000 spectators for a ceremony that posed a first major test for organisers ahead of the 2024 Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Florent Manaudou carried the torch from the deck of the Belem, a three-masted vessel which had transported it from Greece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manaudou passed the torch to Paralympic champion sprinter Nantenin Keita, who handed it to French rapper Jul to light a cauldron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Belem entered Marseille's Old Port surrounded by hundreds of small boats, planes from the Patrouille de France display team swooped overhead tracing the Olympic rings in the sky before they returned to paint the red, white and blue of the French flag in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fireworks also tore into the sky as the Belem docked after its 12-day voyage from Greece, where the flame was lit in Olympia on April 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrival of the flame marks the start of a 12,000-kilometre torch relay across France and its far-flung overseas territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers are hoping the first public spectacle of the Games on French soil – just 79 days from an opening ceremony that will take place on the river Seine – will help build excitement after a row about ticket prices and concerns about security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's something we've been waiting for for a very long time," chief organiser Tony Estanguet said on Monday, referring to the 100 years since Paris last staged the Games. "The Games are coming home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, which was also the host in 1900, sees itself at the heart of the modern Olympic movement after a French aristocrat, Pierre de Coubertin, revived the idea of the Games as practised by the Greeks until the 4th century BC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Covid-hit edition in Tokyo in 2021 and the corruption-tainted Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, the Paris Olympics are seen as an important moment for the sporting extravaganza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the background in Marseille, around 6,000 security forces are on duty at a time when the country is on its highest terror alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other stars to take part in the parade, which continues in Marseille on Thursday, include NBA-winning basketball player Tony Parker and Ivory Coast football great Didier Drogba.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extremely tight security will be a constant feature as the torch travels through more than 450 French towns and cities, and passes by dozens of tourist attractions including the Mont Saint Michel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 200 members of the security forces are set to be positioned permanently around it, including an anti-terror SWAT team and anti-drone operatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has referred to the risk of protests, including from far-left groups or environmental activists such as Extinction Rebellion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers have promised a "spectacular" and "iconic" Olympics, with much of the sport set to take place in temporary venues around the City of Light including at the Eiffel Tower and the Invalides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the absence of a much-feared security scare, the opening ceremony will take place in boats on the river Seine in a radical departure from past Games which have opened in the main stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of the major infrastructure has been completed with only two new permanent sporting venues built in a bid to reduce the financial cost and carbon emissions of the global extravaganza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The idea of the torch rally harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will run from July 26-August 11, followed by the Paralympics from August 28-September 8. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from devastating floods that have ravaged southern Brazil for days reached 100 on Wednesday, authorities said, as the search continued for dozens of people still missing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with hundreds of people injured and 160,000 forced from their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have no access to drinking water or electricity – or even the means to call for help with telephone and internet services down in many places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as "the emergency is continuing to develop" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats, and even jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people are loathe to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Contaminated water can transmit diseases," civil defence spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Confederation of Municipalities said nearly 100,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at about 4.6 billion reais (more than US$900 million.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Porto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at risk of rupturing. (AFP)

    FTX says customers will be repaid for losses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customers of failed cryptocurrency platform FTX will be made whole on the assets they lost when the company collapsed in 2022, it announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plan "contemplates the centralised distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022," said a statement released by FTX Trading LTD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total distributions to customers will be between US$14.5-US$16.3 billion. FTX said the plan still must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors," said John Ray III, chief executive and chief restructurings officer of FTX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX said it garnered the funds "by monetising an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets," mostly investments held by the company and affiliates and litigation claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another factor was the resolution of claims against the firm, including some US$24 billion that had been sought by the Internal Revenue Service for the period prior to the Chapter 11 filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To resolve the IRS cases, FTX will instead pay US$200 million in cash and US$685 million to be paid out after other claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan also will pay out interest of up to nine percent, FTX said. What won't be included will be the appreciation in value that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed since November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX collapsed suddenly following a deluge of customer withdrawals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's chief architect, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison following a conviction of fraud and other financial crimes. (AFP)

    'South Gaza hospitals have only three days' fuel left'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This Palestinian boy faces a long wait for treatment at the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752368_1_20240509003721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have only three days of fuel left, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday, due to closed border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite international objections, Israel sent tanks into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and seized the nearby crossing into Egypt that is the main conduit for aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The closure of the border crossing continues to prevent the UN from bringing fuel. Without fuel all humanitarian operations will stop. Border closures are also impeding delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tedros said Al-Najjar, one of the three hospitals in Rafah, was no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in the vicinity and the military operation in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At a time when fragile humanitarian operations urgently require expansion, the Rafah military operation is further limiting our ability to reach thousands of people who have been living in dire conditions without adequate food, sanitation, health services and security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This must stop now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geneva-based WHO is the UN's health agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel bombarded Rafah on Wednesday as talks resumed in Cairo aimed at agreeing the terms of a truce in the seven-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed more than 34,800 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Revamp involving railway police aims to boost policing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they are integrating some 300 police officers in the Railway District into five land regions from the middle of this month, in a bid to improve operation efficiency and anti-terrorism efforts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After a one-month trial period, officers from the land regions will take over the duties of railway police, including daily patrols and response to railway incidents, in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 1985, the Railway District is responsible for maintaining law and order in the railway system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephen Yu, a district commander of the Railway District, said their work was affected by problems such as MTR service disruptions in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see the challenge and we encounter challenges in that by relying solely on the MTR trains as our only means of transportation to respond to rail incidents is difficult and that would hinder our professional response. The public definitely would like to see their reports to be dealt with promptly and timely," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, if there's an incident happening in one of the MTR stations, our officers will encounter problems and difficulty to get to the scene of the incident because of the suspension of the train service. Now, what we think is it would be much easier and it would be much more timely for the officers from the service side to respond. Now, that includes the emergency unit, police tactical unit, and the patrol unit of the service formation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the revamp, the railway police will be overseen by the police headquarters, instead of the Kowloon East regional headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The operations wing’s chief superintendent, Pierre Wong, said it does not mean that the long-standing Railway District is being “dissolved”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't use the word of dissolving the rail district. What I will use is the enhancement of the policing project because the railway district will subsequently come under the command of the operations wing of the police headquarters. So you can't say it's not existing. It will continue to exist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our focus is to, through the operation deployment arrangement, enhance the overall capability of our officers. That is our objective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they will also combine the railway response team and the counter-terrorism response unit to beef up counter-terrorism efforts.

    Beijing slams US chip export licence withdrawals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said it firmly opposes the US withdrawing export licences to telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, as it also vowed to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The remarks came after the US Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has revoked some export licences related to Huawei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, a Reuters report, citing sources, noted that the US government has withdrawn special licences that allows chip suppliers Qualcomm and Intel to sell order-generation semiconductors to Huawei for use in its laptops and handsets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing called the move by Washington “a typical practice of economic coercion” and a “violation to its commitment to not decouple from China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The US has generalised the concept of national security, politicised economic and trade issues, abused export control measures, and repeatedly imposed unreasonable sanctions and repression on specific Chinese firms. China is firmly opposed to this,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in response to media inquiry on the reported cancellation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It not only violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but also severely harms the interests of US companies. What the US has done has significantly violated its commitment,” the spokesperson added, citing that these actions are also in stark contrast to the US claim of “precisely defining national security”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei did not immediately comment on the decision by the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancellations came after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro, powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra9 processor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid spying concerns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University in Washington DC on Wednesday and arrested demonstrators, hours after dozens marched to the home of the school’s president as city officials prepared to appear before Congress on the protest’s handling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith were called to testify on Wednesday afternoon at the Republican-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, but the hearing was cancelled after the arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States, and increasingly in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges cracked down immediately. Others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District of Columbia police said officers moved to disperse demonstrators because “there has been a gradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.” It said 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Some protesters were pepper sprayed as police blocked them from the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George Washington University had warned of possible suspensions for continuing the camp on University Yard. Protesters carrying signs that read, “Free Palestine” and “Hands off Rafah,” also marched to school President Ellen Granberg’s home on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While the university is committed to protecting students’ rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,” a school statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, police detained 86 people following an operation to remove students staging a pro-Palestinian occupation at the Sorbonne university in Paris, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested in the police operation on Tuesday night were being held for a variety of public order offences, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include wilful damage, rebellion, violence against a person holding public authority, intrusion into an education establishment and holding a meeting designed to disrupt order. Some are also being held for participation in a group with a view to preparing violence or damage to property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before police moved in, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said there would never be a right to disrupt France's universities with such protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, pro-Palestinian protesters built barricades at the University of Amsterdam, using desks and railings to block off the canalside entrance in the heart of the city as they vowed to stay put until the institution severs all ties with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riot police used a bulldozer to knock down barricades at another University of Amsterdam site on Tuesday and detained 169 people, but said the university had not yet asked for similar intervention on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Lam says the injunction is not meant to restrict the normal operation of internet service providers. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752353_1_20240508203331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam said the government will ask internet service providers to remove the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong", adding that such a move will not hinder normal journalistic and academic activities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the ruling is not meant to target tech giants such as Google or Meta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the effect is to persuade the internet service provider not to provide the convenience and not to facilitate the commission of unlawful act. And that also makes it crystal clear that the injunction is not aiming at restricting the normal operation of any internet service provider," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Free flow of information is of crucial importance to Hong Kong. This is a core value that we will do our best to maintain and preserve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee also welcomed the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, he wrote that the injunction safeguards national security and the dignity of the national anthem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the song was used to incite acts endangering national security and "Hong Kong independence", causing harm to both the SAR and the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In banning the song, the Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling last year, with the three judges agreeing with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam added that the court ruling will not lead to unreasonable restrictions on freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Court of Appeal actually conducts the well-known proportionality test to consider whether a grant of injunction would in fact lead to any disproportional or unreasonable restriction on the freedom of expression," the secretary for justice said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But after conducting that proportionality analysis, the court came to the conclusion that in all the circumstances, the injunction would not constitute any unreasonable restriction on freedom of expression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that “preventing anyone from using or disseminating the relevant song with the intention of inciting secession and insulting the national anthem is a legitimate and necessary measure by the SAR government to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security”.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Presidents Xi Jinping and Aleksandar Vucic shake hands in a signing ceremony in Belgrade.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that a free trade agreement between China and Serbia will take effect on July 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is one of six measures announced by the president to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he met the press with his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, after they held talks in Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbia is the first European country to build such a community with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures announced by Xi, there will be more direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai and airlines will be encouraged to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou, and China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realise the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples," Xi said in a joint press conference with Vucic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vucic called Xi an “ironclad” friend and said his visit to Serbia is “historic” because it opens the path for even closer ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, the two countries said they decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday night on the second leg of his European tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes on the anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 1999 during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself," Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Maintenance work to close four MTR stations on July 28

<img alt="Passengers can still take the Tsuen Wan and Tuen Ma lines. Photo: MTR" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752330_2_20240508171958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Wednesday said it would close a major stretch of the Kwun Tong Line for a rare, full-day maintenance operation later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There will be no service between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on Sunday, July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, said all four stations affected would still be served by either the Tsuen Wan or Tuen Ma lines, while free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the asset renewal work would be completed in time for people to get to work on the following Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the reason why we chose the 28th of July is because it is in the middle of the summer holiday. We believe that quite a number of citizens will be on holiday on that day, and that students also have no school on that day. We are trying to minimise the impact to the passengers and also to the citizens in the town," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KH Lee, chief of the corporation's operations engineering maintenance, said they would replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station, adding the work was necessary based on asset condition and life cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are lots of complexity not only because of the preparation of those safety precautions, but also all the work associated with this sort of hangar replacement, like in the course of the hangar replacement, we have to relocate and dismantle some of the existing overhead line and also their parts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Upon completion of the work, we have also arranged tests to ensure every system is in good order before we resume the service, so there's a reason why we have decided to have a one-day closure together with the two non-traffic hours.That means before and after to complete the work in one go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added several stations would need to carry out similar tunnel facility renewal projects in the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people RTHK spoke to said repair work was inevitable for maintaining efficient railway services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There needs to be maintenance from time to time as facilities start to age, or there will be more signal failures in the future. That would lead to longer waiting times, which is very troublesome for people," said a man surnamed Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man named Tsoi said he would leave earlier than his usual time when using the train that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman named Lam said she is a bit worried that there will be huge crowds while travelling that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It could be quite disruptive to people especially since they are working during travelling hours at some of the busiest stations," she said.

    Court grants injunction over 'Glory to Hong Kong'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted a temporary injunction order banning the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their decision, judges Jeremy Poon, Carlye Chu and Anthea Pang said they agreed with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said criminal law alone could not achieve the purpose of safeguarding national security regarding the matter, since it is not practicable to bring proceedings against "unidentifiable" people online who commit offences in relation to the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that there had been "widespread and persistent" flouting of the law before and especially after the national security law came into force in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such is the seriousness of the criminal problems that the court must intervene immediately to prevent the continuation of the prevailing unlawful state of affairs; otherwise any further damage to national security would likely to be irreparable," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said the injunction was necessary to persuade internet platforms to remove "problematic" content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They agreed with a lower court ruling earlier that the injunction may have “chilling effects”, but said it has addressed concerns about the right to free expression by allowing exceptions for lawful action connected to the song, such as academic and reporting activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lower court had last year rejected the government's bid for an injunction, saying it would be "of no real utility". The Department of Justice appealed against that ruling.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said professionals who came to Hong Kong through a new admission scheme have created billions of dollars of economic output.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the second day of a talent summit in Wan Chai, Sun said the government recently conducted a study to see how they are doing in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We estimate that the more than 30,000 people who had arrived here through the Top Talent Pass Scheme in 2023 can bring in about HK$34 billion of direct economic contribution to Hong Kong a year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This means they help boost our GDP by around 1.2 percent a year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said many of these professionals moved to the SAR with their young families - with two-thirds of them being under 40 - and helped rejuvenate the city’s ageing society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said a memorandum of understanding newly signed between the 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) would help expats settle in the GBA.

 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed the budget bill by a show of hands, with no one calling for a recorded vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan thanked legislators for their support, saying officials will do their best to implement relevant measures in a speedy manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Hong Kong is consolidating its finances in light of a budget deficit, much like many economies around the world coping with the post-pandemic environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief said the government is seeking to cut costs and find new sources of revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're confident and we also have determination to balance the books in around three years' time," he told lawmakers in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That does not include the proceeds from bond issuance. We're implementing a fiscal consolidation programme that is a common practice around the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that money received from issuing bonds will not be spent on recurrent expenditure, but on investment and infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong is in the midst of an economic transition with both opportunities and challenges, but the former outnumber the latter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the SAR needs to grasp the international situation better, and understand the country's development strategy as well as focus on meeting different challenges.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Auto-giant Toyota doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March, as strong vehicles sales and a favorable exchange rate lifted results for Japan’s top carmaker.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Toyota on Wednesday said its annual profit totaled 4.9 trillion yen, up from 2.45 trillion yen the year before, while its sales jumped 21 percent to 45 trillion yen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results exceeded Toyota’s own projection for a 4.5 trillion yen profit, as its global sales surged to 9.4 million vehicles from 8.8 million vehicles in the previous fiscal year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales of hybrids performed well, although Toyota stressed it was working hard to offer various kinds of electric vehicles, including battery EVs, plug-ins and fuel cell models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles during this fiscal year, with sales projected to grow in the US and the rest of Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toyota said it will make key investments in areas such as research on technology in coming months to sustain long-term growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It expects its net profit for the fiscal year through to March 2025 to decline nearly 28 percent to 3.57 trillion yen, with spending also covering investments in workers at suppliers and dealers it called “human capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auto industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation away from old-style gasoline engines, especially in markets like China, where EVs dominate and some analysts say automakers like Toyota may have fallen behind. (AP)

    Court reduces jail term of ear biter by 6 months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Court of Appeal deducted six months from Joe Chen's 14.5 years jail sentence. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752287_1_20240508124316.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The man who bit off part of an ear of then-district councillor Andrew Chiu in 2019 had his sentence reduced by half a year on appeal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Joe Chen was ordered to serve 14.5 years behind bars in 2022, after being found guilty of three counts of wounding with intent and a count of common assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had used a knife to stab a couple and kicked another woman on the same day before he bit Chiu outside Cityplaza in Taikoo Shing, following a protest that took place in the shopping centre in November 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down judgment on Wednesday, the Court of Appeal said Chen had paid damages of HK$3.9 million to the four people he had attacked and he had sold his flat to pay the unusually large sum of civil claim money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appeal court judges Derek Pang and Anthea Pang said High Court judge Judianna Barnes should have considered the payment as a mitigating factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said Chen had "showed his sincerity" by starting to make compensation arrangements even before the trial of this case began, which greatly reduced the suffering of the four victims during the civil claim process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the appeal court judges disagreed with the appellant's lawyers that the starting point of the sentence was too high, noting the victims were traumatised both physically and psychologically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu lost part of his left ear as a result, and the other man surnamed Wan, who sustained multiple knife injuries, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges added they did not agree that Chen had assaulted the four because he was triggered, noting he was the one who initiated a brawl with Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fact that Chen, under the influence of alcohol, lost his temper and attacked the victims after Wan swore at him, did not make him less culpable, the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also refused to accept the appellant's promise to donate his body for scientific research after death as a proof of positive good character.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752290_1_20240508124850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that it will consider asking suppliers of non-plastic tableware to voluntarily submit quality and safety certificates, amid concerns that some products could contain carcinogenic substances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Green groups have cited overseas studies as showing that some non-plastic utensils and food containers, including some made from paper, wood and bamboo, have been found to contain the "forever chemicals" PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and fertility issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said officials are aware that there have been public concerns about the quality and safety of such products since a ban on single-use plastic items came into effect last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a question from lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, Tse said the authorities don't demand information on any PFAS content in non-plastic tableware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To provide better services to the public and the trade, the government will consider inviting suppliers to voluntarily submit relevant certificates or documents, and listing out non-plastic tableware with these certificates or documents for reference," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also cited international research organisations as saying PFAS only pose a very low risk to people's health when products only contain trace amounts of the substances.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's investment promotion agency and its office to attract strategic firms to the city on Wednesday said it had lured 45 companies in the life sciences and health technology sector to set up, or expand their businesses in the SAR since the end of 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  InvestHK said these companies, the majority of which were based on the mainland, had invested a total of HK$6.5 billion into the city, creating around 3,200 jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing, Maggie Lo, from the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, said these firms, including pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, were impressed by the level of support available in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we approach overseas companies and when we introduce our initiatives and opportunities, they were pleasantly surprised that the Hong Kong government has catered funding incentives to support every stage of their development — from basic research, clinical trials, manufacturing to sales and marketing," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added officials would continue to encourage international enterprises to expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

    'Earlier queues for dental clinics not that helpful'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="'Earlier queues for dental clinics not that helpful'" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752270_1_20240508112523.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker and a patients' rights advocate on Wednesday said the government's plan to bring forward the pre-registration hours for public dental clinics only deals with the symptoms of a queuing problem, and not the cause.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers on Tuesday that people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, instead of from midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows criticism from the Audit Commission which found patients queuing for hours overnight to be in with a chance of getting an appointment the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Tim Pang from the Society for Community Organisation said the real problem is that there aren't enough public dentists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The queue will just start earlier in the day ... because the root of the problem is the insufficient manpower of the Department of Health, leading to insufficient service availability. Therefore, no matter how the queuing arrangements are changed, the core problem is actually manpower,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pang's view, lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan noted on the same programme that there are only about 20,000 appointments available at public clinics each day, just half of the pre-pandemic level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For every 1,000 citizens, we only have 0.37 dentists... we have a significantly lower number of dentists compared to other cities,” said Chan, who chairs Legco's panel on health services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a former president of the Hong Kong Dental Association, Nelson Wong, said 108 of 300 Department of Health dentist positions are vacant at the moment.

    Hottest April on record last month: EU climate monitor

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752266_1_20240508104826.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's climate monitor on Wednesday said last month was the hottest April on record and the 11th consecutive month of historic global heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oceans were also overheating with April marking the 13th straight monthly high for sea surface temperatures, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the C3S said in a monthly bulletin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including April, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period - 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the extremes - including months of record breaking sea surface temperatures - have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system," said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the EU's climate monitor also said the natural El Nino phenomenon which warms the Pacific Ocean and contributes to hotter weather globally "continued to weaken" in April towards more "neutral conditions". (Reuters/AFP)

 Police are investigating an accident in which a truck driver died in the early hours of Wednesday when he was thrown from his vehicle in a crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The truck rammed into railings on Tsuen Wan Road near Chai Wan Kok Cooked Food Market shortly after midnight when the driver apparently lost control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 66-year-old man fell from the vehicle and was found on Hoi Shing Road, which runs parallel with Tsuen Wan Road. He had suffered multiple injuries and was declared dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traffic was congested on Wednesday morning as the slow lane of Tsuen Wan Road, near where the accident happened, remained closed.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown and Derrick White combined for 57 points as the Boston Celtics scored a dominant 120-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers to take a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The No.1 seeds, chasing a record-breaking 18th NBA championship, were always in control against their fourth-seeded Eastern Conference rivals, holding a double-digit lead through the second half to close out an emphatic win at the TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown led the scoring for Boston with 32 points, six rebounds and two assists while the in-form White caught the eye with a 25-point haul that included seven three-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum added 18 points but had an off-night shooting-wise, making just 7-of-19 from the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donovan Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 33 points, with Evan Mobley adding 17 and Darius Garland 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown said the Celtics' defense had laid the foundation for the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It starts with defense, we wanted to set the tone on defense and we kept them under 100 [points]," Brown said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston got off to a flying start, jumping out to an early 12-2 first quarter lead before a Cleveland rally saw them edge into a 23-21 lead after Mitchell's running three-pointer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Boston responded swiftly, reclaiming the lead immediately and never allowing Cleveland to get their noses in front thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After taking a 10-point lead into half-time, Boston kept the pressure up in the second half, stretching out to a 26-point lead in the fourth quarter as they romped to a comfortable win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game two in the series takes place in Boston on Thursday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Protests by students demanding universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war spread across western Europe on Tuesday, sparking clashes and dozens of fresh arrests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's punishing assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several hundred protesters resumed a demonstration around the University of Amsterdam campus, where police the previous night were filmed baton-charging them and smashing up their tents after they refused to leave the grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests resumed on Tuesday night, demonstrators erected barriers to access routes watched over by a heavy police deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said in a statement that a total of 169 people had been arrested when officers broke up Monday night's protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had been released apart from two still in custody on suspicion of public disorder offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence had briefly erupted Monday when a small group of counter-protesters wielding flares stormed the main protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 demonstrators were also protesting Tuesday outside the library in Utrecht University and a few dozen at the Technical University of Delft, according to local news agency ANP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the eastern German city of Leipzig, the university said in a statement that 50 to 60 people occupied a lecture hall on Tuesday, waving banners that read: "University occupation against genocide".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters barricaded the lecture hall doors from the inside and erected tents in the courtyard, according to the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institution called in the police in the afternoon, and filed a criminal complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Criminal proceedings have been initiated against 13 people who were in the lecture hall on suspicion of trespassing. No arrests have been made so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, at Berlin's Free University, police cleared a demonstration after up to 80 people erected a protest camp in a courtyard of the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protesters, some of whom wore the keffiyeh scarf that has long been a symbol of the Palestinian cause, sat in front of tents and waved banners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They later tried to enter rooms and lecture halls and occupy them, according to the university, which said it then called in police to clear the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said property was damaged while classes in some buildings were suspended for the day. Berlin police said they made some arrests for incitement to hatred and trespassing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police twice intervened at the prestigious Sciences Po university to disperse about 20 students who had barricaded themselves in the main hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security forces moved in to allow other students to take their exams and made two arrests, according to Paris prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said exams proceeded without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the nearby Sorbonne university building, police late Tuesday moved to eject about 100 students who had occupied an amphitheatre and made 88 arrests, police sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Switzerland, protests spread to three universities in Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Lausanne said in a statement it "considers that there is no reason to cease these relations" with Israeli universities as protesters demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Austria, dozens of protesters have been camped on the campus of Vienna University, pitching tents and stringing up banners since late Thursday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday after administrators who had initially adopted a permissive approach said the protest had crossed a line and caused growing concerns about safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  University president Paul Alivisatos issued a message after officers blocked access to the school's Quad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The university remains a place where dissenting voices have many avenues to express themselves, but we cannot enable an environment where the expression of some dominates and disrupts the healthy functioning of the community for the rest,” he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of protesters had gathered for at least eight days at the university until campus administrators warned them on Friday to leave the area or face removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers later picked up a barricade erected to keep protesters out of the Quad and moved it toward the demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the US — and increasingly, in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges have cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities, according to figures based on reporting by the Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As pro-Palestinian protests continue to spread, the White House said President Joe Biden welcomes peaceful protests at college commencement ceremonies where he and other administration officials will speak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest," she added. "What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden last week addressed the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest "but not a right to cause chaos" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jonas Vingegaard on Tuesday completed his first outing on a bicycle a month after a horrific crash and insisted he was hopeful of bidding for a third straight Tour de France crown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Of course I hope to be there at the start of the Tour de France," the Danish Visma-Lease a Bike rider said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't know exactly how my shape and recovery will go but I will do everything I can to get there," he added of the June 29 to July 21 race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old was hospitalised after suffering rib and collarbone fractures and sustaining lung damage in a mass crash on the Tour of the Basque Country on April 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the first time back on the bike for me, riding outside and it's really nice to be finally able to ride like normal again and finally to be able to ride on the road is really amazing," Vingegaard said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really looking forward to taking the next steps," he continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel good, it's improving day by day. I still have some things to recover from but it's going better and better." (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mats Hummels, Emre Can and Nico Schlotterbeck celebrate after the match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752235_1_20240508075020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Borussia Dortmund showed great composure to reach their third Champions League final after Mats Hummels' second-half goal earned the visitors a 1-0 victory against misfiring Paris St Germain for a deserved 2-0 aggregate win on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes into the second half to send the Germans, who won the title in 1997, into their first final in Europe's top club competition since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will meet either 14-times champions Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, who clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday after a 2-2 draw in the first leg, in the June 1 showdown at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG hit the woodwork four times but failed to find the net as Kylian Mbappe, who is widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season, was a shadow of his usual brilliant self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG, who entered the tie as favourites to reach their second final after they finished runners-up in 2020, made an aggressive start and Mbappe had their first chance in the seventh minute with a half-volley as the hosts piled on the pressure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Mbappe on the left flank and Goncalo Ramos as a lone striker, the France forward had some space out wide and the possibility to cut in and threaten the Dortmund goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors, however, were composed and held firm. Their confidence grew and they had their first opportunity through Julian Ryerson, whose shot hit the side netting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG were lucky the score on the night was level at halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luis Enrique's side stepped up a gear after the break with Warren Zaire Emery's shot hitting the outside of the post after Mbappe's attempt was deflected into his path by Ramos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dortmund were more clinical as Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes after the interval to double the German side's advantage over the two legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Mbappe attempt was deflected onto the bar before Vitinha's powerful shot also hit the woodwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG's Ousmane Dembele was a constant threat after the hour mark but, just like the rest of the team, the France forward came more into the game far too late against a side who never lost their composure and fully deserve their place in the final. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year for the fourth time on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gobert tied Hall of Fame big men Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace for the most times winning the award in league history. He received 72 first-place votes and 433 points from a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert finished tied for sixth in blocks per game [2.1] and averaged 14 points and 12.9 rebounds in 76 games, his ninth straight season averaging a double-double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Gobert's standout achievement this season was anchoring the Timberwolves' stifling defense. Minnesota ranked first in the regular season in points allowed per game [106.5] and field goal percentage allowed [45 percent] and was top five in blocks [4.5] and rebounds [41.4].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert, who is the first player in Timberwolves franchise history to win the award, won his first three Defensive Player of the Year awards with the Utah Jazz, earning the honor in 2018, 2019 and 2021. A three-time All-Star, Gobert has averaged 12,7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocks in 757 regular-season games during his 11-year career with the Jazz [2013-2022] and Timberwolves [2023-2024].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year on Monday, finished second in the voting. Wembanyama, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft, led the league in blocks per game [3.6] and also averaged 1.2 steals per game. He received 19 first-place votes and 245 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo finished third, Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis was fourth and New Orleans Pelicans forward Herbert Jones rounded out the top five. (Reuters)

    Xi Jinping arrives in Serbia after lunch with Macron

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening, after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a high altitude lunch at a childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains for the Chinese leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the next step in his European tour, Xi will hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia, where China has invested heavily to expand its economic footprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian state broadcaster RTS showed Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan descend from their Air China aeroplane to be greeted by Vucic, with a small crowd of welcomers waiting along a red carpet dressed in traditional clothing and holding flags and flowers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations," Xi said in a written statement issued by Xinhua news agency upon his arrival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to have in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, Macron pressed a message to Beijing not to support Russia's war against Ukraine and to accept fairer trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the other two countries chosen by Xi for his first trip to Europe since 2019 – Hungary is his final stop after Serbia – are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first day of Xi's state visit to France saw respectful but sometimes robust exchanges between the two presidents during a succession of talks on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi, for his part, warned the West not to "smear" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on "a great project." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished a choppy session essentially flat on Tuesday, a sideways performance that could persist until investors digest significant economic releases later in the month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The market might just be due for some pause, consolidation," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts pointed to light trading volume in a comparatively quiet period of news after last week saw major earnings reports, economic releases and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upcoming potential catalysts include US consumer price data and Walmart results, both of which are scheduled for next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones edged up 0.1 percent to 38,884.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,187, while the Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 16,332.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney dropped 9.5 percent as it reported a small quarterly loss and pointed to a moderation in travel spending expected to weigh on results at its parks division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple advanced 0.4 percent after unveiling new versions of its iPad tablets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spirit AeroSystems, a major contractor to Boeing and Airbus, fell 0.3 percent as it reported a US$616.7 million quarterly loss, reflecting a drag from lower output amid Boeing's quality control problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has also so far not reached a pricing agreement with Airbus, further weighing on financial performance. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi on Tuesday decried "completely unsatisfactory" cooperation from Tehran after returning from Iran where he urged leaders to adopt "concrete" measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi's visit came at a time of heightened regional tensions and with his International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) criticising Iran for lack of cooperation on inspections and other outstanding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The present state is completely unsatisfactory for me. We are almost at an impasse and this needs to be changed," Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna, where the IAEA is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there was no "magic wand" to solve a "very, very complex set of issues," while he pressed the Islamic republic to "deliver very soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, for me and also I would say for the international community, there is a need to have some results sooner rather than later," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan, Grossi said he had proposed to Iranian officials that they "focus on the very concrete, very practical and tangible measures that can be implemented in order to accelerate" cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi held talks with senior Iranian officials including Atomic Energy Organisation's head Mohammad Eslami and spoke at Iran's first International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology held in Isfahan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi insisted on the need to "settle differences" on the nuclear issue while the Middle East was going through "difficult times", particularly the war between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes, political conditions pose obstacles to full-fledged cooperation" between Iran and the international community, Grossi told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi said a March 2023 agreement with Iran was "still valid" but required more "substance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement was reached during Grossi's last visit to Iran and outlined basic cooperation measures including on safeguards and monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IAEA chief said, however, that there had been a "slowdown" in the agreement's implementation, including Iran reducing the number of inspections and withdrawing the accreditation of a group of IAEA experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran suspended compliance with a landmark 2015 deal setting caps on nuclear activities after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Caitlin Clark’s first WNBA game in Los Angeles is being moved to a bigger stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Los Angeles Sparks said on Tuesday that their home game against Clark and the Indiana Fever on May 24 is being moved from Walter Pyramid on the Long Beach State campus to Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other Sparks home games – May 26 against Dallas and June 5 against Minnesota – are also moving to Crypto.com Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's where the Sparks usually play all their games and it seats 19,067 for basketball games. Walter Pyramid seats 5,000. The games were originally moved to Long Beach because of construction at Crypto.com Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women’s basketball is experiencing unprecedented viewership and attendance numbers so moving these games back to Crypto.com Arena provides us the ability to have more fans in the stands and have our players back to competing on their home floor," Sparks President Christine Monjer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sparks will still open the season on May 15 against Atlanta and play Washington on May 21 in Long Beach. (AP)

    Canadian police probe shooting near Drake's home

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police cordoned off the superstar's mansion following the shooting. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752210_1_20240508011635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tiny Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09 am (0609 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating," the inspector added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road's edge in front of the mansion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Drake, known for hits such as "God's Plan" and "Hotline Bling," was the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is currently embroiled in a feud with Kendrick Lamar, with the rappers exchanging barbed "diss tracks" that have drawn widespread attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beefs are nothing new in hip-hop, a genre long known both for its artists' boasts and their strongly worded takedowns of rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no indication that the shooting had any relation to the rap battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the bad blood between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Krawczyk said he was aware of it, but added, "it is so early in the investigation that we don't have a motive at this time, and so I cannot comment further on that." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The decision means Nottingham Forest remain on 29 points, three points above the relegation zone, with just two games left to play. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752208_1_20240508001828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest have failed in their appeal against a four-point penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules, the English top flight announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club were hit with the sanction by an independent commission in March for breaching the profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) threshold of £61 million (US$76 million) by £34.5 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest quickly indicated their intention to appeal but an independent appeal board panel has upheld the original penalty, which relates to a three-year assessment period ending with the 2022/23 season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means the 17th-placed club remain on 29 points, three points above the relegation zone, with two games left to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest had sought a reduction in the punishment because they felt the original commission should have taken the big-money sale of Brennan Johnson to Tottenham, two months after the end of the financial year ending 2023, into account as a mitigating factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also felt the original commission had made a mistake by not wholly or partially suspending the sanction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A release published on the Premier League website read: "The club argued that the independent commission committed an error in not treating its sale of a high-profile player shortly after the assessment period as a mitigating factor, and that it committed a further error in electing not to suspend some or all of the points deduction it imposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Each of these grounds was rejected by the appeal board, which found the independent commission was entitled to immediately impose the sanction it did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The four-point deduction will therefore remain in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In November, Everton were docked 10 points for breaching PSR, reduced to six on appeal, while a separate two-point deduction imposed on the club for a separate breach is under appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Goodison Park club are now clear of relegation danger following a run of good results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier League clubs are usually allowed maximum losses of £105 million over a three-year assessment period but this is reduced by £22 million per season for any seasons within the period spent in the Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, two time European champions, were promoted to the Premier League in May 2022, meaning two seasons of their three-year assessment period were as a second-tier club. (AFP)

    Stormy Daniels takes witness stand at Trump trial

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the heart of Donald Trump's hush money case, took the witness stand on Tuesday at the blockbuster trial of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The people call Stormy Daniels," prosecutor Susan Hoffinger announced as the 77-year-old Trump sat at the defence table in the Manhattan courtroom flanked by his lawyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels' testimony is expected to be a pivotal moment in the courtroom drama rocking the scandal-plagued Republican's attempt to recapture the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, 45, a long-time actor and director in the adult film industry, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was then paid to keep quiet about it on the eve of his 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, when the news could have sunk his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels and Susan Necheles, a lawyer for the former president, lodged an objection with the judge presiding over the trial to allowing her to testify about any "sexual acts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unduly prejudicial," Necheles told Judge Juan Merchan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hoffinger said Daniels' testimony would not be graphic and would "omit details that are too salacious."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors say that Trump – desperate to kill Daniels' story before it could wreck his chances in the narrow 2016 race – illegally reimbursed his fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover up the US$130,000 hush money payment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, who has become a vocal critic of his former boss, is also expected to testify at the trial as a prosecution witness. (AFP)

    Macron hosts Xi Jinping in French mountains

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin’s Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around them. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as “Viva, viva Palestina”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus, and officers could also be seen carrying some students away, and using pepper spray against some of the protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the Free University Berlin campus,” university president Guenter Ziegler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at US campuses. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says further integration and development with mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive, John Lee, on Tuesday called on the financial sector to enhance cooperation with the mainland, after the nation’s securities regulator introduced measures to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last month unveiled five measures to promote coordinated development between the capital markets of the mainland and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These measures included relaxing eligibility criteria for exchange-traded fund products in the Stock Connect mechanism, as well as the inclusion of real estate investment trusts for the first time. The CSRC also said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech to over 200 business leaders prior to a closed-door discussion on enhancing collaboration between the financial markets in Hong Kong and the mainland, Lee said cross-border cooperation will bring in more business opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further integration and development with the mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages and enhance the competitiveness of the mainland financial market, attracting more capital and businesses. This will drive economic development and will allow people to share in the fruits of progress," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting with business leaders, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the SAR government is still in negotiations with mainland authorities on the implementation of the CSRC's measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that these measures would allow international investors to use Hong Kong as a gateway to access mainland equity markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is the national springboard for mainland capital and investors seeking overseas opportunities, and thereby provides a very convenient and very familiar platform for overseas investors to go through Hong Kong to participate in the mainland equity market," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission’s CEO Julia Leung, meanwhile, told reporters that the measures are expected to be implemented as early as the third quarter.

 A liver disease patient who passed away a few months after two transplants died of misadventure, a jury at the Coroner's Court ruled on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The five-person jury returned the majority verdict following a 13-day inquest into the death of Tang Kwai-sze, with experts divided on what caused her liver failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. She died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering its verdict, the jury said Tang suffered from hepatitis B flare-up because of her taking high-dose steroids without being prescribed antiviral medication at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In guiding the jury to make its recommendations, coroner Monica Chow said jurors needed to consider whether new measures by the Hospital Authority (HA), including a guideline on antiviral prescription for hepatitis B carriers using immunosuppressive therapy, were enough to protect patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jury made five recommendations to the HA, including requiring doctors to prescribe antiviral drugs for patients on high-dose steroids for even less than seven days, subsidising hepatitis B carriers to do regular check-ups at private hospitals, educating them about precautions and symptoms, making sure doctors' clinical records were clear, and providing a reason when laboratories cancelled a test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up the hearing, the coroner told Tang's eldest daughter Michelle Wu that while her love for her mum would not fade with time, she hoped Wu could "one day fill the void left by her mother in a positive way".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner noted that Wu had volunteered to donate her liver to her mother and that showed how brave she was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All mothers in the world will tell you that [Tang] would feel comforted and proud to have such a brave, selfless, and loving daughter like you," Chow said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Christian Hospital, in response, said it respects the jury's verdict and will study its suggestions in detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had put in place measures to improve the process of prescribing medicine and the communication between medical workers and patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital again expressed condolences to Tang's family and said it would assist them where needed.

 A drone show will be held on Saturday to mark the Cheung Chau Bun Festival as well as Buddha’s Birthday, according to the Tourism Board.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The board said 1,000 drones will form patterns that resemble the iconic bun tower, Chinese flower plaques as well as other festive symbols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show will start at 8pm at the Wan Chai harbourfront and will last for around 10 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board added that there will be free ice creams from 6pm to 8pm that night near Wan Chai Ferry Pier.
