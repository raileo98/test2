    Govt says locals get priority for care home jobs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Monday dismissed a claim that the government is "replacing all local care home workers with imported staff".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The allegation came from Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker and executive councillor Stanley Ng, who complained that officials didn't discuss with unions a plan to bring in another 8,000 care home workers in the coming three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past year, 7,000 care workers were brought to Hong Kong under a special scheme for homes that failed to find local staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun told lawmakers that with an ageing population, the demand for care workers will only increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the quota under the import scheme might not be fully used if homes find local staff instead, adding that local workers will always be the main source of manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With reference to actual circumstances, we see or anticipate that there will be a wastage in the sector," Sun said at a Legco welfare services panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The age of existing workers is already quite old. If they retire, we cannot meet the service gap because we do not have as many youngsters as we want to join the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials are determined to make sure that local people have priority when it comes to employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a large-scale job fair will be held in September, with many non-governmental organisations operating care homes expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that the government will update the Labour Advisory Board about the special import scheme every six months.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An embankment seen as the second line of defence following a dyke breach in Hunan province was under threat on Monday, local authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 300 police officers and firefighters were working at the site to stem the piping effect that is eroding the embankment in Huarong County, said the province's water resources department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14.3km embankment is located around 2km behind the dyke that burst on Friday at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, following a heavy rainstorm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The piping effect can hollow out a dyke and lead to a burst if not properly handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 7,000 residents have been evacuated following the dyke burst on Friday, and workers have been racing against time to seal the 226m breach. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University (CUHK) on Monday said it will increase its scholarship funding by almost 90 percent from September, to just under HK$36 million in total.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New students admitted through JUPAS with Level 5** in seven or more subjects will be offered a one-off study allowance and exchange scholarship of HK$410,000, along with a full four-year tuition waiver, the university said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The maximum total value of the scholarship can be over HK$570,000, an increase of over HK$170,000 (approximately 44.6%) compared to last year. Adding with scholarships offered by colleges and faculties, the maximum scholarship value will be over HK$1 million."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that students with Level 5** in seven or more subjects who enrol in the six-year medical programme will be offered a full tuition waiver for an additional two years, with the maximum value of the scholarship increasing by around 18 percent to more than HK$660,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of admissions and financial aid Andy Wong said the plan was put in place even before the government recently announced an increase in university tuition fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Economic recovery after the pandemic has not been as ideal as expected. Many families have seen a significant drop in their income, and students are facing pressures of life and study. By significantly enhancing the scholarships, the university hopes that students will be able to focus on their studies without worrying," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university also said the scholarships will switch from annual renewals to one-off allowances, to give students "more flexibility in their arrangements and planning".

    World should help Ukraine, Russia resume talks: Xi

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called on the international community to help Ukraine and Russia resume dialogue in a bid to resolve their conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi and visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis in talks in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban briefed Xi on his recent visits to Ukraine and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president stressed an early ceasefire and a political settlement are in the interests of all parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi called on the international community "to create conditions and provide support for the resumption of direct dialogue and negotiation between the two sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted him as saying that "only if all major countries inject positive rather than negative energy, can a ceasefire in this conflict emerge as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Russia and Ukraine, the end of the war “depends on the decision of three world powers, the United States, the European Union and China,” Orban wrote in a Facebook post showing him shaking hands with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Peace mission 3.0” is how Orban captioned a picture posted on the X social media platform depicting him after having stepped off his plane in Beijing earlier on Monday in this previously unannounced visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU at the start of July, and Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Orban had come to Moscow as a top representative of the European Council. Several top European officials dismissed that suggestion and said Orban had no mandate for anything beyond a discussion about bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi visited Hungary in May this year for the final leg of a European tour that also took him to France and Serbia. (Agencies)

    FTU calls on govt to license ride-hailing services

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Monday called on the government to regulate online car-hailing platforms and require their drivers to obtain permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTU lawmaker Michael Luk said taxi drivers have struggled to stay afloat in recent years due to competition with illegal cabbies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The taxi industry is facing a severe shortage of drivers, with 10 to 20 percent of taxis idle due to the unlicensed vehicles. Maybe some customers will choose other options," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luk said licensing online ride-hailing services wouldn't hurt the taxi trade and would lead to "fair competition".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think the ride-hailing services and the traditional taxis are [in conflict]. We think to get rid of the unlicensed vehicles... they can obtain more opportunities to develop the industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the lawmaker said officials can consider subsidising taxi drivers to buy fuel and insurance to minimise the impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, transport officials will brief lawmakers on the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday that he hopes two pandas given to Hong Kong as a present will arrive by National Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was in Sichuan to discuss the arrangements with mainland officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting a panda research centre in Dujiangyan with his wife, the CE saw a number of the animals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of them are super attractive. Male or female, some are strong, some are elegant. It appears they enjoy what they eat. I'm especially happy when I'm here at the centre," Lee told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe when the two giant pandas arrive in Hong Kong, members of the public will be as I am now... they'll feel excited and they'll find the pandas amiable. People will also want to get close to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said officials were still discussing the details regarding sending the pandas to Hong Kong.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of the leftist New Popular Front gather at the Place de la République in Paris to celebrate its strong showing in the polls. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760678_1_20240708123101.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France faced a hung parliament and the prospect of taxing negotiations to form a government, after a surprise left-wing surge blocked Marine Le Pen's quest to bring the far right to power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the dominant force in the National Assembly after Sunday's election, but with no single group securing a working majority the possibilities include the NFP forming a minority government or the building of a broad, unwieldy coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result delivered a stinging blow to President Emmanuel Macron and leaves the euro zone's second largest economy in limbo, heralding a period of political instability just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron ended up with a hugely fragmented parliament, in what is set to weaken France's role in the European Union and further afield, and make it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left won 182 seats, Macron's centrist alliance 168 and Le Pen's National Rally (RN) and allies 143, interior ministry data cited by Le Monde newspaper showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would tender his resignation, but it was not clear whether the president would accept it immediately, given the daunting task ahead to form a government. Attal said he would be willing to stay on in a caretaker role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will of course do my duties as long as it's needed – it cannot be otherwise on the eve of a date (the Olympics) that is so important for our country," Attal said as it became clear Macron's alliance had endured a humbling setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties from the NFP – made up of the French Communist Party, hard left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialist Party – met overnight for first talks on how to proceed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France Unbowed's firebrand leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said the new prime minister should hail from NFP. However, the bloc has no leader and its parties are strongly divided over who they could select as a suitable premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some prominent centrist figures, including Edouard Philippe, a former prime minister under Macron, said they were ready to work on a pact to ensure a stable government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The euro fell on Sunday after the vote projections were announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France's legislative ability," said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Le Pen's RN, the result was a far cry from weeks during which opinion polls consistently projected it would win comfortably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left and centrist alliances cooperated after the first round of voting last week by pulling scores of candidates from three-way races to build a unified anti-RN vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first reaction, RN leader Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's protege, called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a "disgraceful alliance" that he said would paralyse France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen, who will likely be the party's candidate for the 2027 presidential election, said however that Sunday's ballot, in which the RN made major gains compared with previous elections, had sown the seeds for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our victory has been merely delayed," she said. (Reuters)

    June hottest on record: EU climate monitor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest June on record across the globe, the EU's climate monitor said on Monday, capping half a year of wild and destructive weather from floods to heatwaves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record in a 13-month streak of unprecedented global heat, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is more than a statistical oddity and it highlights a large and continuing shift in our climate," said the service director, Carlo Buontempo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "inevitable" as long as humanity kept adding heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The global average temperature notched last month broke the previous June record set in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh high came at the midway point of a year marked by climate extremes.
  <br/>

    Japanese pay rises at its fastest pace in 31 years

<div class="itemFullText">
 Average base pay for Japanese workers rose in May at its fastest pace in 31 years, data showed on Monday, a sign that bumper pay hikes offered by companies in annual wage negotiations are gradually being passed onto households.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But inflation-adjusted real wages fell for a record 26th straight month as a weakening yen and higher commodity prices pushed up the cost of imports, complicating the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) efforts to normalise monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Base pay, or regular pay, rose an average 2.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the fastest pace since January 1993, around the time when Japan's asset bubble burst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rise, which was bigger than a revised 1.6 percent gain in April, reflected hefty rises in monthly pay agreed by labour and management at annual labour negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data highlights Japan's increasing wage momentum. While real wages continue to fall, they will likely start rising in July," said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nominal wages, or the average total cash earnings per worker, grew 1.9 percent to 297,151 yen (US$1,850), accelerating from the previous month's 1.6 percent gain to mark the highest year-on-year increase in 11 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when adjusted for inflation, wages fell 1.4 percent in May after a revised 1.2 percent decline in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were signs that Japan's intensifying labour shortage is leading to broader-based wage rises. Wage hikes at firms with 30 or more employees outpaced inflation for the first time in 26 months, though when very small firms with five or more workers were included, pay hikes still lagged inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hourly pay for part-time workers rose 4.0 percent in May from a year earlier, outpacing a 2.7 percent gain for full-time staff. (Reuters)

    Workers at Samsung 'begin three-day strike'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Workers at South Korean tech giant Samsung began a three-day general strike Monday, the head of a union representing tens of thousands of employees told AFP, after talks with management broke down.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The strike has started from today," Son Woo-mok, head of the National Samsung Electronics Union, told AFP, adding that a major rally was scheduled later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union, which has around 28,000 members, or more than a fifth of the company's total workforce, announced the three-day general strike last week, saying it was a last resort after talks broke down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Management at the firm, the world's biggest producer of memory chips, has been locked in negotiations with the union over wages and benefits since January but the two sides have failed to narrow their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now at critical crossroads," the union said in an appeal sent out to members last week, urging them to support the "critical" strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This strike is the last card we can use," the union said, saying that workers at the company needed to "act as one".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This strike is not just about improving working conditions, it is about taking back our rights that have been ignored so far," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers have rejected the offer of a 5.1 percent pay hike, with the union having previously outlined demands including improvements to annual leave and transparent performance-based bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung declined a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung Electronics avoided its employees unionising for almost 50 years -- sometimes adopting ferocious tactics, according to critics -- while rising to become the world's largest smartphone and semiconductor manufacturer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Company founder Lee Byung-chul, who died in 1987, was adamantly opposed to unions, saying he would never allow them "until I have dirt over my eyes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first labour union at Samsung Electronics was formed in the late 2010s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm is the flagship subsidiary of South Korean giant Samsung Group, by far the largest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate business in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is world's largest memory chip maker, and accounts for a significant chunk of global output of the high-end chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung recently predicted a 15-fold increase in its on-year second quarter operating profits, thanks to growing demand for generative AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the global economy, used in everything from kitchen appliances and mobile phones to cars and weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And demand for the advanced chips that power AI systems has skyrocketed thanks to the success of ChatGPT and other generative AI products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductors are South Korea's leading export and hit US$11.7 billion in March, their highest level in almost two years, accounting for a fifth of South Korea's total exports, according to figures released by the trade ministry. (AFP)

    Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760649_1_20240708091647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said Hong Kong will surpass Switzerland to become the world's largest wealth management hub by 2027.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui said Hong Kong’s appeal in attracting foreign investments has been growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR will continue to improve service quality, noting that the government’s proposals to simplify the process of changing the place of incorporation to Hong Kong will attract overseas companies to establish or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On July 3, the government published new legislative proposals for a regulatory framework that makes it easier for overseas companies to re-domicile in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These proposals include relaxing the requirement for financial statement submission and extending the de-registration period from 60 to 120 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Hui said Hong Kong's attractiveness to foreign businesses would persist with its low tax rates and relaxed compliance requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In overseas jurisdictions, there have been more requirements for companies to register a place of incorporation. These requirements primarily focus on compliance, such as the need for local economic activities and specific operations. Some companies might enjoy lower compliance requirements or even lower tax rates in these places in the past,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the introduction of a global minimum tax rate and the rising compliance requirements, these incentives are dwindling. So, this has become a driving factor that encourages them to return to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stopped short on predicting the number of companies that would re-domicile to Hong Kong, but stressed a need to establish a suitable platform and framework in advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday he had arrived in Beijing on "Peace mission 3.0" after recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Orban was greeted at the airport by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, according to a photo he posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His arrival in Beijing follows surprise visits to Russia and Ukraine in the past week since Hungary took over the European Union's rotating presidency at the start of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban, the friendliest EU leader towards Moscow, held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday about the war in Ukraine during a trip criticised by both Kyiv and the EU, which said it threatened to undermine the bloc's stance on the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also came days before a Nato summit that will address further military aid for Ukraine against what the Western defence alliance has called Russia's "unprovoked war of aggression".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a short statement, the Foreign Ministry said the Hungarian leader would meet President Xi Jinping on Monday "for in-depth communication on issues of mutual interest".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary, under Orban, has become an important trade and investment partner for China, in contrast with some other EU nations. (AFP/Reuters)

  The SAR's Tong Tsz-wing and Tang Ming-hong took home the silver medal in the mixed-doubles final.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  Cheng Nga-ching and Matthew Lai took bronze in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also bronze medals for both Tomato Ho and Fung Ching-hei, as well as Toby Tse and Kirstie Wong in the women's doubles event. Alex Lau and Leo Chung claimed bronze in the men's doubles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department says it is investigating a fire on Sunday at a refuse reception centre on Stonecutters Island.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Firefighters had largely put out the blaze by 7 pm, after smoke had been reported in some of the waste about two hours' earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No injuries were reported and all employees were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre has temporarily suspended its operations and users have been told to use other collection points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it would work with the contractor and the Fire Services Department to investigate the cause of the fire. The department has also told the contractor to submit a report within seven days.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates after his fourth round win. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760631_1_20240708075038.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Carlos Alcaraz defeated French 16th seed Ugo Humbert 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to make the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the ninth time in just 14 appearances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, it was another uncomfortable afternoon for the Spaniard, who had needed five sets to see off Frances Tiafoe in the third round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His erratic performance on Sunday saw him drop serve five times and commit an uncharacteristic 33 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old, bidding to become just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back, eased through the first set under the Centre Court roof before crucially saving four break points in the fifth game of the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be there, fighting until the last ball," said Alcaraz, who is chasing a fourth Grand Slam title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz will take on American 12th seed Tommy Paul, who beat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over on Court One, top seed Sinner moved into the last-eight with a 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (11/9) win over American 14th seed Ben Shelton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner, who won his maiden Slam crown at the Australian Open this year, will face Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev for a place in the semi-finals in a rematch of their final in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a tough match, especially the third set. I had to keep saving set points," said Sinner, a semi-finalist in 2023. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760618_1_20240708014703.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Kenyan Faith Kipyegon hit world record-breaking form at Sunday's Diamond League meet in Paris in the perfect boost before the Olympics kick off in three weeks' time in the French capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mahuchikh broke the 37-year-old women's high jump world record, while Kipyegon improved her own record in the women's 1,500m, two results that will make them two of the stars to watch in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Mahuchikh set a new best of 2.10m, beating by 1cm the record set by Bulgaria's Stefka Kostadinova at the 1987 world championships in Rome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Coming into this competition, I had feelings that I could jump 2.07m and maybe 2.10m," said Mahuchikh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finally, I signed Ukraine into the history of world athletics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1,500m, led out by two pacemakers, two-time defending Olympic champion Kipyegon broke to the front and clocked 3min 49.04sec in a superb display of running. It improved by 0.07sec her previous best set in Florence in June 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wow this is just amazing! I am so happy to break the world record over my favourite distance again," said Kipyegon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to come back to Paris to defend my Olympic title!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armand "Mondo" Duplantis went close in a bid to better his own pole vault world record in an afternoon of top-class track and field that featured a stunning men's 800m, while French decathlete Kevin Mayer took a worrying tumble in the 110m hurdles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a distinctly Olympic tinge to proceedings at a packed Stade Charlety in southern Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stadium was awash with tricolour flags, Olympic mascots and a lot of blue after organisers asked fans to come dressed in the colour to support home athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not work for decathlon world record holder Mayer, who tumbled to the ground in the hurdles, the third event of a triathlon also including the shot put and long jump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayer received medical attention before being helped off the track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In better news for the hosts, Sasha Zhoya equalled his personal best of 13.15sec to win the 110m hurdles in a photo finish from American Trey Cunningham. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An embattled US President Joe Biden faced escalating pressure on Sunday from fellow Democrats worried about his candidacy, concerns he aimed to ease with campaign stops in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has faced growing calls to end his reelection bid after a halting performance in a June 27 debate with Republican Donald Trump, 78, raised questions about his ability to do the job for another four years. He has vowed to stay in the race, dismissing calls for him to drop out as "nonsense" in a fundraising email on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the Democratic president attended a Black church service in Philadelphia and was later due to travel to the state capital, Harrisburg, for an event with union members and local Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coming week is crucial, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN's "State of the Union." He encouraged the president to try hold a town hall or news conference to convince voters he is "the old Joe Biden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do think the president needs to do more," Murphy said. "I do think the clock is ticking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democrats also suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris, seen as the likeliest candidate to replace Biden in the November 5 election were he to bow out, could perform well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A much-anticipated Biden interview with ABC News on Friday did little to ease concerns of lawmakers and donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic US Representative Adam Schiff said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that Biden needs to move swiftly to put concerns to rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think she very well could win overwhelmingly, but before we get into a decision about who else it should be, the president needs to make a decision about whether it's him," Schiff said of Harris, a fellow Californian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a meeting on Sunday with senior House Democrats to discuss the president's candidacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Democratic National Committee (DNC) member from Florida, Alan Clendenin, urged Biden to step aside on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Joe Biden will be remembered by historians as one of the finest presidents in American history, but this election is about the next four years, not the last three and a half," Clendenin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DNC has steadfastly supported Biden since his debate stumbles so any defections would suggest a further deepening of the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Friday's interview, Biden said only the "Lord Almighty" could persuade him to drop out, dismissing the prospect that Democratic leaders could join forces to try to talk him into standing down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pennsylvania is one of the half dozen or so states that can swing Democratic or Republican and are expected to determine the outcome of what has been a tight race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's trip - Biden's 10th to Pennsylvania during the 2024 election cycle - is part of a July voter outreach blitz by the Democratic Party that includes a US$50 million media campaign aimed at events such as the Olympics and travel by the president, the first lady, Harris and her husband to every battleground state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign said it aims to have volunteers and staff knock on more than 3 million voters' doors in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pressure from Congress is expected to steadily increase in the coming days as lawmakers return to Washington from a holiday recess, and donors mull their willingness to keep funding Biden's campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The political crisis is unfolding as Biden prepares to host dozens of world leaders at a high-stakes Nato summit in Washington and hold a rare solo news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five US lawmakers have called for Biden to end his reelection bid, including Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives from a battleground district, with others said poised to join in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Given what I saw and heard from the President during last week’s debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the President himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,” Craig, a top 2024 target of House Republican efforts, posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two letters are circulating among House Democrats calling for Biden to step aside, House Democratic sources have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Senator Mark Warner of Virginia invited fellow senators to a meeting on Monday to discuss Biden's campaign. Biden told reporters he had spoken with 20 congressional Democrats, who urged him to stay on. Biden said he knew of no senators ready to join Warner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, who has run for the Democratic nomination for president in the past, stood firmly in Biden's camp on Sunday, saying Democrats' focus should be on policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a beauty contest," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lewis Hamilton held off Max Verstappen in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday for a first victory since Saudi Arabia in December 2021.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I've been waiting for this," shouted Briton Hamilton after crossing the line in his Mercedes to claim a ninth victory at Silverstone, breaking a tie with Michael Schumacher for most wins at one track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris of McLaren was third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After his record-extending 104th Formula One victory, the 39-year-old Hamilton wept as he fell into the arms of his father as the home crowd roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since 2021, every day fighting, training and putting my mind to the task, working as hard as I can," Hamilton, who will be moving to Ferrari after this season, said at the finish line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is my last race for the team here, I love them so much, I'll be forever grateful to everyone at Mercedes and to the incredible fans."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton, who started second on the grid behind his teammate George Russell, recorded his 13th consecutive podium at his home track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell, the winner a week earlier in Austria, was forced out with a hydraulic problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton overtook Russell on lap 18 but was passed by Norris two laps later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a poorly executed McLaren pit stop allowed Hamilton to regain the lead with 12 laps remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton finished 1.465sec ahead of Verstappen who overtook Norris three laps from the finish as the race ended in sunshine after a brief shower during the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's Verstappen increased his lead in the drivers' standings over Norris by three points to 84 points despite failing to win for two consecutive races for the first time since Silverstone and Austria in 2022.
  <br/>

    Pope warns against rise in autocracy, nationalism

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pope Francis attended an event in Trieste on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760611_1_20240707224520.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis decried the state of democracy and warned against "populists" during a short visit to Trieste in Italy's northeast on Sunday ahead of a 12-day trip to Asia -- the longest of his papacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Democracy is not in good health in the world today," Francis said during a speech at the city's convention centre to close a national Catholic event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without naming any countries, the pope warned against "ideological temptations and populists" on the day that France holds the second round of a snap parliamentary vote that looks set to see the far-right National Rally (RN) party take the largest share of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ideologies are seductive. Some people compare them to the Pied Piper of Hamelin: they seduce but lead you to deny yourself," he said in reference to the German fairytale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The culture of rejection creates a city where there is no place for the poor, the unborn, the fragile, the sick, children, women, the young," he regretted, urging facilitation of social participation from childhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of last month's European parliament elections, bishops in several countries also warned about the rise of populism and nationalism, with far-right parties already holding the reins to power in Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis also urged people to "move away from polarisations that impoverish" and hit out at "self-referential power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Venice in April and Verona in May, the half-day trip to Trieste, a city of 200,000 inhabitants on the Adriatic Sea that borders Slovenia, marked the third one within Italy this year for the 87-year-old pontiff, who has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since travelling to the French city of Marseille in September 2023, the Argentine Jesuit has limited himself to domestic travel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he plans to spend nearly two weeks in Asia in September visiting Indonesia, Singapore and the islands of Papua New Guinea and East Timor. (AFP)

 Premier Li Qiang on Sunday congratulated Keir Starmer on becoming UK prime minister, following the general election on Thursday which swept Starmer's Labour Party to power with a huge majority.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li said China and Britain are both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major economies, adding that greater cooperation between the two nations not only serves the interests of the two, but also helps the international community address global challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the Chinese government attaches great importance to its relationship with Britain, and stands ready to work with the new British government to consolidate mutual political trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, support the economic and social development of both countries, and jointly promote world peace, stability, and prosperity.

    High turnout seen as French head to the polls

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A man enters a polling booth to vote in the second round of France's legislative election at a polling station in Le Touquet. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760600_1_20240707183824.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French voters turned out in number on Sunday for the second round of a historic election that is expected to leave the far right as the biggest force in a deeply divided parliament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At midday, according to interior ministry figures, some 26.63 percent of voters had turned out for the high-stakes poll -- the highest number at that time since 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mood in France is tense, with 30,000 police deployed to head off trouble and voters anxious about a potential electoral earthquake shifting the French political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the village of Rosheim, outside the eastern city of Strasbourg, an "anguished" 72-year-old Antoine Schrameck said he feared France would see "a turning point in the history of the republic".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Tourcoing, near the northeast city of Lille, 66-year-old retiree Laurence Abbad said she feared violence after the results are announced. "There's so much tension, people are going mad," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections three years ahead of time after his forces were trounced in June's European parliament vote, a gamble which seems to have backfired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) came top in the June 30 first round, and is on course to repeat the feat in Sunday's run off races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she may not win the outright majority that would force Macron to appoint Le Pen's lieutenant, the RN party leader Jordan Bardella, 28, as prime minister just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hung parliament with a large eurosceptic, anti-immigration contingent could weaken France's international standing and threaten Western unity in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Union officials, already learning to deal with far-right parties in power in Italy and the Netherlands, are watching France closely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Rome, Pope Francis chose the day of the French vote to warn against "ideological temptations and populists", adding: "Democracy is not in good health in the world today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the country on tenterhooks, last week saw more than 200 tactical-voting pacts between centre and left wing candidates in seats to attempt to prevent the RN winning an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This has been hailed as a return of the anti-far right "Republican Front" first summoned when Le Pen's father Jean-Marie faced Jacques Chirac in the run-off of 2002 presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls now forecast that the RN will fall well short of the 289 seats needed for an outright majority in the 577-seat National Assembly, while still becoming the largest party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an outcome could allow Macron to possibly build a broad coalition against the RN and keep Gabriel Attal as prime minister on a caretaker basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it could also herald a long period of paralysed politics in France, as it prepares to host the Olympics from July 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many in France remain baffled over why Macron called an election that could end with the RN doubling its presence in parliament and his contingent of centrist MPs halving in number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the president, known for his theatrical gestures, appears intent on executing what he calls a "clarification" of French politics, which he hopes will eventually leave three clear camps of far right, centre and hard left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final opinion polls published by two organisations on Friday projected the RN would win between 170 to 210 seats, followed by the New Popular Front (NFP) broad left-wing coalition on 145 to 185 and Macron's centrists on 118 to 150.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Macron's Ensemble alliance is forecast to come third, the more successful NFP is a fragile mix of several warring factions ranging from traditional Socialists to the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) of firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "France is on the cusp of a seismic political shift," said analysts at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), warning that even if Macron controlled the government after the election he would face "legislative gridlocks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would weaken "France's voice on the European and international stage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After voting began on Saturday in France's overseas territories, polls opened in mainland France at 0600 GMT and were due to close by 1800 GMT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Projections -- which usually give a very close idea of the final outcome -- are published shortly afterwards, with the political leaders then reacting rapidly to any frenzy that grips the nation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey by the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday highlighted the difficulties faced by tenants living in inadequate accommodation such as subdivided flats, cage homes and rooftop slums during the recent hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Most of the 300 tenants surveyed reported difficulty sleeping and feeling unwell due to the intense heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Observatory, the temperature reached almost 35 degrees Celsius on Sunday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that the indoor temperature in these cramped flats could reach as high as 41 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze Lai-shan, the organisation's deputy director, said the heat had also increased the utility bills of these tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called on the government to subsidise water and electricity bills for these tenants, and to build more public and transitional housing so that they have decent accommodation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday that he would work with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office to arrange the early arrival of two giant pandas in the SAR during his trip to Sichuan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee announced on July 1 that the central government would send the pandas to the territory as gifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters before his departure, the CE said he would visit the giant pandas as well as local facilities in the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would also like to thank the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office for sending leading officials to Sichuan and working with us to arrange the early arrival of the giant pandas in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee and his delegation will visit the Dujiangyan base of the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, said she hoped the pandas could arrive before the National Day celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If conditions allow, we can try to bring more than two pandas to Hong Kong for a short stay to see if they can adapt. Of course, in the end, we may have to choose the two pandas who have the most fun in Hong Kong to stay here," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former coach and captain Hong Myung-bo will return to guide South Korea's national men's football team, the governing body said on Sunday, five months after the dismissal of Jurgen Klinsmann.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We have signed Hong as our next national team head coach," a spokesman for the Korea Football Association (KFA) told AFP, declining to give any details of Hong's contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann, a World Cup winner as a player in 1990, was dismissed after South Korea's disappointing semi-final exit from the Asian Cup in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong returns as South Korea coach 10 years after stepping down in the wake of the team's group-stage exit from the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong, 55, is celebrated as one of South Korea's greatest football players. As a defender, he captained the South to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup, which South Korea co-hosted with Japan, and scored the decisive penalty in a quarter-final shootout against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann was dismissed after only a year in the job following a 2-0 Asian Cup defeat by underdogs Jordan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just before his sacking, it emerged there had been a bust-up on the eve of the semi-final loss between Tottenham striker Son Heung-min and Lee Kang-in of Paris Saint-Germain, leaving Son with a dislocated finger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann later said in an interview with The Athletic that he and his coaching staff were made "responsible for the fight".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The KFA's leading target to replace Klinsmann, former Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch, chose to coach Canada instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governing body also reportedly talked to Iraq's Spanish coach Jesus Casas, with 71-year-old Senol Gunes from Turkey and former Saudi Arabia coach Herve Renard also in the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea, led by Son as captain, played the past four World Cup qualifier matches under two interim coaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong will guide the national squad through the final stages of qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. (AFP)

    English Schools Foundation proud of IB exam results

<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who have achieved a perfect score in the International Baccalaureate (IB) exams have expressed their desire to make a positive impact in their chosen fields and contribute to society.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They come from seven schools run by the English Schools Foundation, which was proud to see 17 of its students achieve a perfect score of 45, more than double the number who did so last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them is Tsang Chi-him from King George V School. He expressed his desire to become a doctor to help alleviate the shortage of medical staff in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do realise that Hong Kong currently has a shortage of doctors, and I do wish to help alleviate this problem. I would like to give back to my community as well, and help with the situation here in Hong Kong as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another student from the same school shared her aspirations to study bioengineering at the University of California in Los Angeles and return to Hong Kong after graduation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just in the LA area, especially there is a lot of startups and a lot of advancements regarding the bioengineering industry, and there's just a lot more working opportunities there," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I do hope to come back to Hong Kong, because I do know that the bioengineering industry in Hong Kong is growing really rapidly right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Christopher Dingcong, a top scorer from Sha Tin College, plans to study aerospace engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to pursue a degree outside of Hong Kong, because for me, specifically I'm doing aerospace engineering, and abroad, there are many universities with much more experience in that," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here in Hong Kong, it's still okay. Of course we have it, but just the land and the landscape doesn't really lend itself to having those facilities that they would often need for aerospace engineering like runways or stuff like that for aircraft."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Baccalaureate Organisation has previously confirmed that some candidates appeared to have leaked exam questions on social media before other students in later time zones sat the same papers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rob Shorthouse, ESF's director of strategy and communications, said the incident had not affected the performance of ESF students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the results that our students have achieved, while it was an unwelcome distraction, it hasn't had an impact. Our students have done very, very well and we're proud of every single one of them," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 2,400 Hong Kong students sat the IB exams this year, with at least 29 of them achieving the highest possible score. The average score was 36.63, higher than the global average of 30.32.

 Police arrested two teenagers on Sunday on suspicion of stealing a minibus in Mong Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a minibus driver reported at around 7am that his vehicle, parked on Sai Yeung Choi Street South, had gone missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police later found the minibus near the Sheung Shui MTR station and arrested the two suspects, aged 19 and 13, nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were detained on suspicion of taking conveyance without authority, driving without a licence and without third-party insurance.

 Ceremonies took place place in Beijing on Sunday to mark the 87th anniversary of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Politburo member Yin Li presided over a ceremony at the Museum of the War of the Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression near the bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting at 9 am, it began with the national anthem. Poems and songs were then sung by students from the capital. Attendees left floral tributes and bowed to pay their respects to those who had laid down their lives fighting the Japanese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony was attended by about 500 people, including war veterans and family members of those who had taken part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known locally as the Lugou Bridge Incident, it took place on July 7, 1937 when Japanese forces attacked Chinese troops on the bridge in the outskirts of Beijing. The incident is recognised as the beginning of Japan's full-scale invasion of China. (With additional reporting from Xinhua)

Photo courtesy of Commercial Radio" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760569_1_20240707122416.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Councillor Lam Ching-choi said on Sunday that officials are exploring the use of advanced technology, such as facial recognition, in housing estates to prevent elderly people with cognitive impairment from getting lost.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam, who heads an advisory committee on mental health, mentioned that tracking devices are currently being used on some elderly people with cognitive impairment. These technologies can enable them to get out and about without getting lost, which is good for their mental wellbeing and that of their carers, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The use of facial recognition and artificial intelligence is one of the methods. This will certainly require the consent of the elderly and their family members," Lam said after attending a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of such products that have been tested, and the success rate is high. So by using different types of technology, results can be achieved."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another matter, Lam expressed concern about the shortage of staff in residential care homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He revealed that there is currently a shortage of 20 to 30 percent of the required staff, even after the arrival of 7,000 imported workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To address this, the government plans to import about 8,000 workers in phases over the next three years, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested exploring cooperation with training organisations on the mainland so that caregivers can obtain the necessary licences before coming to work in Hong Kong.

    Visually-impaired passengers get HK Express apology

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Express Airways on Sunday apologised to two passengers, who are visually impaired, after staff asked them to leave a flight to Tokyo in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move came after the Hong Kong Blind Union said two of its members had complained that they had been unreasonably forced to leave the plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference, the union said the airline had cited safety reasons for asking them to leave. The Blind Union's president, Billy Wong, said a new approach was needed from the Civil Aviation Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a supervisory and coordinating agency and a government department, we hope the Civil Aviation Department can do more to help people with visual impairments or disabilities so they can use these services easily and equally in Hong Kong, which is an aviation hub," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the budget carrier said it was sorry for the inconvenience and delay caused to the passengers and promised to provide compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its ground staff and crew members had different assessments of the two passengers who had initially been unable to board their original flight as scheduled following, what it described as, a thorough assessment by management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the airline said it was later confirmed that both passengers could safely travel unaccompanied and staff immediately arranged for them to board another flight on the same day.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business remained resilient despite geopolitical headwinds last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said assets under management stood at more than HK$31 trillion in 2023, up about 2.1 per cent year-on-year, with two-thirds of the assets coming from outside the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that the SAR remained the second largest private equity management centre after the mainland, with private equity fund assets exceeding HK$1.7 trillion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The above figures show that despite the changing international geopolitical situation, investors still have confidence in the prospects of the mainland and Hong Kong markets," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is important for us to do our job well and continue to explain how the country is steadily improving, the central government's strong support for Hong Kong and the unique benefits under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the city's flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, had announced that it would buy back the remaining preference shares from the government this month, showing that the aviation industry was moving towards full normalcy.

    Biden remains defiant in TV interview

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden's presidential reelection bid hung in the balance Saturday, after his latest efforts to put a disastrous debate showing behind him failed to silence voices urging him to quit the White House race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murmurs of dissent within his own Democratic Party have -- in the case of five individual House representatives -- morphed into direct calls for him to drop out. And a number of key donors have threatened to cut off funding if Biden insists on staying the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump," Angie Craig, the latest House Democrat to break ranks, said Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democrat representatives for Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democrat Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the upper chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what had been billed as a make-or-break TV interview on Friday, Biden's strategy was to flatly deny the falling poll numbers and concerns over his mental and physical fitness triggered by his dismal performance against rival Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed a severe cold for the debate debacle and insisted it was just a "bad night" rather than evidence of increasing frailty and cognitive decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the 81-year-old was adamant that he would not be pressured to end his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race," he said. "But the Lord Almighty is not coming down."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for less divine intervention do, however, appear to be strengthening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's campaign team is pushing ahead regardless, with two events planned in Pennsylvania on Sunday and visits to other battleground states later in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in Wisconsin before Friday's interview, Biden had delivered a forceful, energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then came the sit-down with the ABC network that appeared unlikely to soothe the concerns of critics who say that -- away from a teleprompter -- Biden can struggle to communicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of his answers were tentative, meandering and difficult to follow, even as he sought to deflect questions about his mental acuity and dismissed the notion that his party would consider replacing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign had another small fire to put out Saturday after it emerged that the White House had provided the questions for interviews the president gave to two Black radio stations on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic strategist David Axelrod suggested in a CNN op-ed that Biden is engaged in "Denial. Delusion. Defiance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stakes are as great as Biden describes. And if he believes it, as I think he does, he will eventually do what duty and love of country requires, and step aside," Axelrod wrote in the piece published Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If he does not, it will be Biden's age, and not Trump's moral and ethical void, that will dominate the rest of this most important campaign and sully the president's historic legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, meanwhile, sarcastically suggested Biden should "ignore his many critics and move forward, with alacrity and strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He should be sharp, precise and energetic, just like he was in The Debate," the Republican challenger said in a social media post Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, Democrats are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the meetings of top Congressional Democrats in coming days will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, for Biden and his campaign team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next major test will be a press conference scheduled for Thursday during the NATO leaders' summit in Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When pressed in the ABC interview on why he doesn't take an independent neurological exam, Biden argued that the role of US president meant being subjected to constant mental assessment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a cognitive test every single day," he said. "Not only am I campaigning, I'm running the world." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An own goal by Mert Muldur completed a dramatic comeback for the Netherlands on Saturday as they overcame a tenacious Turkey 2-1 to book a Euro 2024 semi-final meeting with England.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defender bundled the ball into his own net in the 76th minute under pressure from Cody Gakpo as the Dutch bounced back from a poor first-half display to win a bruising clash and complete the final four line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stefan de Vrij had equalised only six minutes earlier after Turkey went into the break 1-0 up from Samet Akaydin’s 35th- minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey rode waves of passionate support at the Olympiastadion to get on course for an unlikely semi-final place but, after keeping the Dutch at bay they finally succumbed to the pressure in the last 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only one of the weekend’s quarter-finals to be completed without extra time or penalties was no less drama-filled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey’s goal came after a strange decision from Dutch fullback Denzel Dumfries to let a shot, which had clearly deflected off Nathan Ake, go out for a corner when he could easily have kept the ball in play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The resultant set piece was initially cleared but fell for teenager Arda Guler to deliver a perfect cross to the back post and Akaydin was first in a queue of three Turkish players to rise and head home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goal came after sustained pressure from Turkey, who had seen off early Dutch dominance, to set up several opportunities, including a succession of corners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enterprise from the Dutch was met with tenacious defence as Turkey giving their opponents little room to play in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not help the Dutch cause that attackers Memphis Depay and Gakpo looked flat, prompting coach Ronald Koeman into throwing on pinch hitter Wout Weghorst at the start of the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the imposing centre forward looked to sew panic among the Turkish defenders, however, it was at the other end that the next opportunities arose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guler’s 56th-minute free kick was bent expertly around the Dutch wall but struck the outside of the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten minutes later, Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen got a hand to deny Baris Alper Yilmaz’s stinging shot and Kaan Ayhan missed out on tucking away the rebound as Weghorst cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch kept plugging away and, as Turkey’s defence became more scrambled, they finally made the breakthrough with Depay’s cross finding an unmarked De Vrij to head home in the 70th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege continued and it was matter of time before the Dutch grab a second, bundled in six minutes later as Gakpo pressurised Muldur after a cross by Dumfries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tired-looking Turks, drawing last vestiges of energy from rabid support from the majority of the capacity crowd, gamely sought to take the game into extra time but had desperate efforts blocked by the Orange defence and Verbruggen made another key save in stoppage time. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's Jordan Pickford saves a penalty in the shootout. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760554_1_20240707080815.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barely a week after furious fans hurled beer cups and insults at Gareth Southgate, the England manager danced with his players in front of the team's supporters on Saturday after a thrilling shootout victory launched them into the Euro 2024 semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Southgate's men defeated Switzerland 5-3 on penalties after regulation ended 1-1, with Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka scoring a brilliant equalizer when he cut in from the right wing and curled a blistering 20-metre left-footed shot in off the far post following Breel Embolo's opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate's 100th game as England boss was his team's best in an uninspiring tournament that has seen the 53-year-old come under fire and speculation swirl about his future in the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then you think 'Surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job?'. So if I can't enjoy that moment, then the whole thing is a waste of time," the normally unflappable Southgate said, on letting loose to dance with his players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win put England in their third semi-final in four tournaments, where they will face either Turkey or the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I love the players, I love being in that moment with them. I took this job to try and improve English football. I wanted us to regain credibility on a world stage. So I can't deny that when it's as personal as it's been in the last few weeks on a human level, that's quite difficult," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we're fighting. We're not going to stop fighting. And as I said, we're in another semi-final and we'll see where we can get to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold converted from the penalty spot to clinch the win. The Liverpool defender joyously grabbed the ball as it rebounded out of the goal and booted it high into the air as his teammates hurtled forward in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were watching the (Spain-Germany) game last night and I spoke to them about it, just about playing well. Spain mixed their game up. They took seven yellow cards. They found ways to win," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These players are showing all those other attributes, dealing with everything that's around us. Twice coming from behind in games, now a penalty shootout where their composure was impeccable. So I'm so, so proud of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've been in four (shootouts), we've won three. We got absolutely crucified for the one we lost."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate was particularly pleased for Saka, who was subjected to racial abuse after missing the decisive penalty in their Euro 2020 final loss to Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I gave him a massive cuddle on the pitch," the manager said. "He's a special boy. He's a dream to work with. Wonderful family. And, of course, you're pleased for everybody, but for him especially when his went in." (Reuters)

    Red Bull's renowned designer Newey delays future plans

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Adrian Newey at the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix 2024 in Miami, USA. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760536_1_20240706214641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Newey, the much-coveted designer who is leaving Red Bull, will not make any announcement on his future until September at the earliest - and may delay a decision until the end of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newey, 65, has been linked to Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Williams and Aston Martin, since saying he wanted to leave Red Bull where he has won 13 world titles in nearly two decades of success with the team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has suggested he will continue to work in Formula One and may not make a final decision until later this year after easing off "to focus on final development and delivery of Red Bull's first hyper-car, the RB17", as revealed by Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know. At the moment, I'm just kind of still working on the RB17, our track car, and just taking some time off, Newey told Sky Sports F1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last week, actually, we took seven days and had lucky timing with the weather and went around the south coast with our dogs in an old Aston Martin DB6. Great fun!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if he had to decide his future by a deadline at the end of the year, he said, "That's certainly the target. I'll need to have my mind up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newey, widely regarded as a guru of ground effect technology, is expected to leave Red Bull finally in March next year, allowing him to take part in the development of a new car for the new 2026 regulations with whichever team he joins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was reported to have had a tour of Aston Martin's factory last month and has been in negotiations with them, but any deal with the ambitious Silverstone team is unlikely to be announced before September to comply with his contract at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Martin last week recruited the highly-rated former Mercedes engine boss Andy Cowell to take over as group chief executive officer, replacing Martin Whitmarsh in October. (AFP)

    Winning all that matters at Euro 2024 for Mbappe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Portugal's forward Cristiano Ronaldo embraces France's Kylian Mbappe prior to the UEFA Euro 2024 quarter-final match. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760540_1_20240706221117.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three goals scored in five games, one a penalty and two own goals, and yet Kylian Mbappe's France are into the semi-finals of yet another major tournament as Spain await at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is remarkable that any team could get to the last four of such a competition despite struggling so much in front of goal, but all the more so when that team is captained by arguably the best forward in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe is surrounded by other world-class attackers, but his penalty in a group-stage draw with Poland is the only goal scored by a French player at this European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having edged Belgium in the last 16 thanks to a late own goal, France came through a nail-biting quarter-final against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal on Friday, triumphing 5-3 on penalties after a goalless two hours of football in Hamburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said it before lots of competitions. The most important thing is that we win," Mbappe told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People thought it was a wisecrack. I have only scored one goal but we are in the semi-finals and I am really happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In charge for 12 years and at his sixth major tournament, France coach Didier Deschamps has regularly been criticised for not playing thrilling football with an extraordinary collection of players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has always got results, with France winning the 2018 World Cup and 2021 UEFA Nations League under his watch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the 2022 World Cup final on penalties to Argentina and the Euro 2016 final in extra time against Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now they are in a fourth semi-final in the last five major tournaments despite their paltry record in front of goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece may be remembered as perhaps the least spectacular side to win such a competition, but their status as outsiders at Euro 2004 justified a more cautious approach, and they still scored seven goals in six matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including their 0-0 friendly draw against Canada just before the Euros, France have gone six games without one of their players finding the net in open play, a first in 60 years according to statisticians Opta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That record has not prevented them advancing to the semi-final against a Spain side who have found the net 11 times in Germany. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Saturday prepared for its most consequential legislative election of recent times, with residents of overseas territories opening voting for a poll expected to give the far right its biggest ever presence in parliament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A traditional final day pause was observed on Saturday ahead of Sunday's second round runoff after a frenetic campaign that saw tensions rise across the country and dozens of attacks on candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Underlining France's global footprint that spans the oceans of the world, the first French region to vote was Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a small French archipelago off the coast of Canada where citizens began voting from 1000 GMT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were to be followed on Saturday by residents of French Caribbean territories including Martinique and Guadeloupe as well as Guiana in South America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Pacific territories come next before people in mainland France cast their ballots from 0600 GMT on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls will close by 1800 GMT on Sunday when projections of seat numbers -- regarded in France as a firm indicator of the final outcome -- are published.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Final opinion polls on Friday suggested that far-right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) would fall short of winning an outright majority in the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Emmanuel Macron's gamble in calling snap elections is expected to end with his centrist alliance having half the number of deputies it had before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now faces the final three years of his presidency with no clear ruling majority, and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal perhaps trying to hold together a caretaker government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen insists that she is still on course for victory and an absolute majority that would force Macron to appoint her 28-year-old lieutenant Jordan Bardella as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attal vowed to stay on "as long as necessary" in a caretaker role, while Macron's office is studying options to maintain some form of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron is to remain in office until presidential and legislative elections in April 2027, but he must now face the possibility of sharing power with political foes. (AFP)

    New UK PM Starmer 'restless for change' after win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly elected UK prime minister Keir Starmer on Saturday began his first full day in charge declaring himself "restless for change" and pledging that growth would be his Labour government's "number one mission".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer also confirmed his previously declared intention to end the outgoing Conservative government's flagship scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started... I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent," he told reporters following his first cabinet meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party on Friday won a landslide election victory, bringing to a close 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour leader told his top team, including Britain's first woman finance minister Rachel Reeves and new foreign minister David Lammy, it had been "the honour and the privilege of my life" to be invited by King Charles III to form the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a huge amount of work to do, so now we get on with our work," he said to applause and smiles around the cabinet table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer spent his first hours in Downing Street on Friday appointing his ministerial team, hours after securing his centre-left party's return to power with a whopping 174-seat majority in the UK parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable lower-ranking appointments included Patrick Vallance, chief scientific government adviser during the Covid-19 pandemic, who has been made a science minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Timpson, whose shoe repair company employs ex-offenders, was also made a prisons minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both would be given seats in the upper house of parliament in order to join the government as neither is an elected lawmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said both new ministers were people "associated with change" and illustrated his determination to deliver concrete improvements to people's lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm restless for change, and I think and hope that what you've already seen demonstrates that," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists on Friday had welcomed Starmer to Downing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But daunting challenges await his government, including a stagnating economy, creaking public services and households suffering from a years-long cost-of-living crisis. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's George Martin is tackled by New Zealand's Sevu Reece during the rugby union Test match between the New Zealand All Blacks and England at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760528_1_20240706190400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damian McKenzie landed two late penalties as New Zealand beat England 16-15 in the first Test on Saturday to make a winning start to the tenure of new coach Scott Robertson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held their nerve in a brutal defensive contest in Dunedin in which both teams scored two tries, extending their winning run on home soil against England to eight matches since 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It took a grinding effort in the second half to secure victory after England winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso scored a try to break a 10-10 deadlock at the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks struggled to penetrate a disciplined England defence and never threatened a try in the second half, but they did enough to set up McKenzie for penalty goals in the 54th and 65th minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie was timed out when lining up a third penalty attempt in the dying stages but England failed to score from the final play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks came into the game after just 10 days under former Canterbury Crusaders mentor Robertson, who succeeded Ian Foster after the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had also lost a handful of experienced players -- retired or playing abroad -- in the wake of their World Cup final loss to South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coming off a 52-17 win over Japan two weeks earlier, England played with great cohesion but also struggled to create try-scoring chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither team led by more than five points throughout an absorbing contest dominated by the physicality of the collisions and some confusion on rulings made by Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli.

  England fly-half Marcus Smith missed an early penalty before All Blacks winger Sevu Reece opened the scoring with a try after fielding a McKenzie cross-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors struck back through a close range try by lock Maro Itoje but New Zealand regained the ascendancy when 2023 World Player of Year Ardie Savea capitalised on a break from full-back Stephen Perofeta to score in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand conceded a penalty after the half-time hooter which was slotted by Smith to square the scores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England dominated the opening exchanges after the break and created space for Feyi-Waboso to cross in the corner.

  England prop Joe Marler could be in doubt for the second Test in Auckland next week after exiting early with a foot complaint while All Blacks scrum-half TJ Perenara didn't return from the half-time break following a knee injury. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An electoral official said the voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760513_1_20240706155606.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian said the vote was the start of a "partnership" with the Iranian people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy, and trust. I extend my hand to you," Pezeshkian said in a post on social media platform X, after on Tuesday saying he would "extend the hand of friendship to everyone" if he won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act "against the system".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for "constructive relations" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to "get Iran out of its isolation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping congratulated reformist Masoud Pezeshkian for his win in Iran's presidential runoff election, state media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I attach great importance to the development of China-Iran relations and am willing to work with the President to lead the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership towards deeper advancement," state news agency Xinhua reported Xi as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries "have a long history of friendly exchanges, and bilateral relations have maintained healthy and stable development... for over half a century," Xi said, according to Xinhua.(AFP)

 The International Baccalaureate or I-B has released results for its May diploma exams, with at least 29 Hong Kong students achieving the highest possible score.
 <br>
  <br/>
  IB issued the results to the schools on Friday night, and students were able to access their individual results on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the local top-scorers, 17 students from the English Schools Foundation’s seven schools achieved a perfect score of 45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also four top-scoring students from Diocesan Boys' School and two from Victoria Shanghai Academy, Yew Chung International School and Singapore International School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One top performer each hails from St. Paul's Co-educational College, St Stephen's College and Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School.

    Customs uncover first underground cigarette factory

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Saturday said they have uncovered the first ever underground cigarette factory in Lau Fau Shan. They said the facility was equipped with a complete production line.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities also uncovered a cigarette storage warehouse in Man Kam To and seized over 20 million suspected illicit cigarettes and about 3.5 tonnes of processed tobacco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the haul had a market value of HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four men, aged 29 to 46 were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs division commander Lam Chak-lun said the investment in this cigarette production line had been huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, it was located in a large-scale, airtight prefabricated building. And the building was heavily insulated with industrial soundproofing material, hidden inside a factory,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can effectively block light and noise generated while the machines are running. It was also powered by solar panels, likely to avoid drawing attention from authorities due to high electricity usage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities said they believed the production line was on a test run and had only been operational for a short time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two women accused of kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O were remanded in custody after appearing in court on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair, Xue Shanshan and Leung Lai-wa, both unemployed, faced a charge of kidnapping for allegedly forcibly taking the boy against his will from a mall on Wednesday with the intent of obtaining ransom in exchange for the child's release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy, allegedly taken for a ransom in cryptocurrency, was rescued by officers in a flat in Tseung Kwan O on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Court Magistrate Don So rejected a bail application from one of the women, and the other did not apply for bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case has been adjourned until September 23.

    'New social workers board chair qualified for the job'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun on Saturday expressed confidence that a lawyer appointed to chair a statutory body overseeing social workers will command the respect of the sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Herman Hui was among 12 new members picked by the government to the reformed Social Workers Registration Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a radio programme, the minister acknowledged that the board's chairperson was not a registered social worker, but noted his status within the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Herman [Hui] is well-known in the welfare field. He has been serving the sector for more than 30 years. While he's not a registered social worker, I'm sure for those in the welfare sector, Herman is so well-known because of his dedication, commitment, and also selfless service to the sector. I'm sure he's going to command the respect of the sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said it did not matter where the board members came from, following suggestions that the government could bring in representatives from smaller organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said members were appointed to the statutory body on a personal basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are requested to carry out their duties dutifully, and not having regard to where they are coming from. There's no difference for those coming from larger, smaller, or medium-sized welfare organisations, because they look after social workers from an independent point of view," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Social Workers Registration Board was only concerned with the registration of individual social workers, and not welfare institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not relevant whether or not they are coming from larger or smaller organisations in the field," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grace Chan, the business director of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, is the deputy chairperson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other members include former permanent secretary for labour and welfare Annie Tam, as well as members of the government's social welfare advisory committee, Frederick Lai and Barry Wong, who are all part of a coalition, the Hong Kong Social Welfare Sector Heart to Heart Joint Action.

    Firefighters struggle to contain California blazes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wildfires are becoming increasingly common - partly as a result of climate change. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760478_1_20240706090917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 California firefighters battled multiple blazes in record heat on Friday, with a new fire breaking out near the famous Yosemite National Park even as a larger inferno further north came under control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Temperatures up to 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) were recorded in the western US state on Friday, as the region's latest heat wave nears its peak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Dangerous heat is likely to become more widespread in the West today and Saturday... Temperatures will be 15-30 degrees above average for much of the West Coast today," warned the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or broken," the NWS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The excessive heat comes on the July 4 weekend, when millions of Americans celebrate the anniversary of their nation's independence with displays of fireworks that can spark blazes in hot, dry conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fast-moving fire erupted just outside Yosemite National Park late on Thursday, causing large parts of the former Gold Rush town of Mariposa to be evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Friday afternoon, the fire had burnt nearly 405 hectares and was 15 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winds have calmed which has helped firefighters make progress overnight," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some residents had been allowed to return to their homes. The fire's cause was not yet known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also progress in northern California, where earlier this week thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Thompson Fire near Oroville.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some of the region's highest temperatures, firefighters reported success in containing the blaze, with some evacuation orders lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, fire officials and forecasters warned that the danger is far from over, with high temperatures expected to spread further and to peak Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week," warned the NWS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate scientists say the western US is undergoing a decades-long aridification as weather patterns change, at least in part because of human-caused global warming. (AFP)

    HK 'hoping for locally-bred panda': Kevin Yeung

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tourism chief Kevin Yeung says the SAR delegation to Sichuan will discuss matters such as transport and quarantine arrangements for the two giant pandas. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760485_1_20240706102646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials plan to tell Beijing of the SAR's desire for a locally bred giant panda during a visit to fine-tune the arrangements for two animals that the central government is giving to the city, according to the tourism chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, also said on Saturday that he hoped the two giant pandas will arrive in the city in two to three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister, along with Chief Executive John Lee, his wife, and other officials, are set to head to Sichuan on Sunday to know more about the arrival of the two giant pandas and discuss transport and quarantine arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Yeung said local officials are expressing their wish to see the birth of the city's first panda cub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that most people in the SAR would like to see pandas being born in Hong Kong. We've expressed this wish," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, the central government is gifting us a pair of giant pandas. I believe they'll take our wish into consideration. But in the end, it's up to the central government and mainland departments to decide."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the two animals could come to Hong Kong in around two to three months, but it would ultimately depend on their conditions after quarantining for a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's tourist figures, Yeung said he is confident that this year could see 46 million arrivals, with more people expected to visit Hong Kong during the summer and public holidays in the latter half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he conceded that spending patterns have changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector, as a whole, cannot simply rely on spending from tourists to boost sales... Other than thinking of ways to attract tourists to spend more here, we also need to look for ways to have people in Hong Kong spend more," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said authorities will conduct test runs at the Kai Tak Sports Park in early 2025 by hosting a sporting event and a performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the administration hoped to have around 50,000 people test out the venue and transport arrangements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden vowed on Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on "feeling terrible" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong," the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that "Biden sounds great!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's focus on what really matters," Biden said, reading from tele-prompters. "We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose (in November)", she said. "This is realism, not disrespect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" he do more major interviews to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the Nato meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside. (AFP)

    Deadline looms for beleaguered Boeing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are assembled at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760474_1_20240706084446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than five years after two fatal 737 MAX crashes, Boeing faces a fresh legal reckoning now that prosecutors have concluded the company flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aviation giant had been on a Friday night deadline to accept or reject a Department of Justice proposal that would require it to plead guilty to fraud during the certification of MAX airplanes, sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been no public comment either way by the evening, and a lawyer for the families of the 737 crash victims, Robert Clifford, told AFP that he believed the deadline would be extended over the weekend if Boeing asked for more time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest legal predicament was triggered by a DOJ determination in mid-May that the company ignored a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not meeting requirements to improve its compliance and ethics program after the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under a proposal presented by the DOJ to families of MAX crash victims, Boeing would pay an additional US$243 million penalty and agree to have an external monitor, said Tracy Brammeier, an attorney at Clifford Law who represents families of MAX victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The guilty plea is significant. No one wants to be a convicted or admitted felon," said Brammeier, who nonetheless described family members as dissatisfied with the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a US court on how it will proceed no later than July 7, with the agency expected to announce steps to prosecute Boeing should the company reject the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing, which has previously said it honoured the terms of the DPA, declined comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021 near the end of the Trump administration over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification of the MAX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year. But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing breached its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of victims, who have pressed for a criminal trial of Boeing and its top executives, remain unhappy that the new plea agreement does not explicitly link Boeing's fraud to the 346 fatalities from crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, according to Brammeier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The families want accountability and still are not getting it," Brammeier said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash, said the DOJ should also impose much stiffer fines on Boeing -- from US$10 billion to US$20 billion -- with the caveat that they could be suspended if the company invests in safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's too good a deal for Boeing," said Stumo, who added that Boeing should not have a say in who is appointed its independent monitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, said the DOJ's decision to stick with the original charge -- rather than supplement it -- reflects a desire to "bring the claims that could be most easily proven if it goes to trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said DPAs like Boeing's often "poorly serve" the public interest because "prosecutors probably care much more about achieving a conviction than ensuring the defendant is adequately deterred and restrained," he wrote in a blog post this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coffee suggested the DOJ should consider measures such as barring CEO compensation models that encourage risk-taking, or ensuring that funds clawed back from executives who plead guilty of wrongdoing go to whistleblowers as a way "to shift some of the cost of deterrence from shareholders to senior management." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (centre) looks on at the Spain-Germany match. The hosts were knocked out of the tournament. Photo: Reuters." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760473_1_20240706084058.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain will face France in the semi-finals of Euro 2024 after knocking out hosts Germany as Turkey reacted with dismay to defender Merih Demiral's two-match ban for making an alleged ultra-nationalist salute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luis de la Fuente's Spain triumphed 2-1 in an engrossing match between the two best-performing teams at the tournament, thanks to Mikel Merino heading home Dani Olmo's cross just as the match looked destined for a penalty shoot-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a winning horse... I'm proud to coach players like this, players that are insatiable," said De la Fuente.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a tough end to the tournament for Germany, who pushed Spain all the way and took the match to extra time with Florian Wirtz's 89th-minute strike which levelled Olmo's opener for La Roja.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We played a good tournament but when you're so close, to be eliminated like that, it's bitter," said Toni Kroos after his final Germany match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain now will be favourites to claim a record-breaking fourth European crown after their seventh straight win inspired by Olmo, who replaced injured Pedri after just eight minutes following a clash between the Barcelona midfielder and Kroos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came through a huge test against the Germans in Stuttgart and will pose a completely different kind of problem to France, who beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties after a drab match finished goalless after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Theo Hernandez coolly struck home the winning spot-kick as France went through to the last four despite their only goals from open play in the tournament being scored by opposition players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix was the only player to miss in the shoot-out, striking the base of post, meaning that Portugal go home and ageing icon Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score a goal at a major tournament for the first time in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France have reached the semis in four of the last five tournaments and coach Didier Deschamps said: "We mustn't take that for granted, that's what I always say. It's what all the players in the team deserve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey's government blasted as "unfair and biased" Demiral's ban, which means he misses Saturday's last-eight clash with the Netherlands and that his Euros campaign is over unless Vincenzo Montella's team reach the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demiral was the unlikely hero with a brace in Turkey's 2-1 win over Austria in the last 16 and during celebrations for his second goal made a gesture associated with Turkish right-wing extremist group Grey Wolves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UEFA banned Demiral for, among other things, "violating the basic rules of decent conduct", a move which Turkey's Sports Minister Osman Askin Bak claimed was politically motivated and Montella said was based on a "misunderstanding".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It wasn't a political gesture as it was interpreted," insisted Montella, who added that the wolf gesture is a "symbol of the Turks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will have a vociferous backing in Berlin for a match which will be attended by the country's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claimed Demiral was just "showing his excitement".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England will have Jude Bellingham available for their quarter-final with Switzerland after he was handed a reprieve by UEFA for his crotch-grabbing celebration after keeping the Three Lions in the competition in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham, who has scored twice in Germany, was filmed mimicking the gesture while apparently looking towards Slovakia's bench following his stunning stoppage-time overhead kick which took that match to extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gareth Southgate called UEFA's ruling, which allows him to select his star player, a "common sense" decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there was no intent in the gesture towards anybody other than the communication he has with his family," claimed Southgate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A win over the Swiss, who dumped out Italy in the last 16, would set up a semi-final with Turkey or the Dutch as England look to break a 58-year major tournament duck. (AFP)

    Canada's jobless rate hits 29-month high

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rising unemployment has fuelled concerns about the Canadian economy. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760452_1_20240705232143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's unemployment rate rose to a 29-month high of 6.4 percent, data showed on Friday, highlighting that people might be losing jobs as the labour market struggles to absorb a rapidly swelling population.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jobs report, which also showed that youth unemployment reached almost a decade high barring the pandemic years, prompted money markets to increase bets of a rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) this month to around 56 percent from 40 percent a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists pointed out that the rising unemployment rate could be indicating that Canada is flirting with recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A sustained deterioration is typically only seen during recessions," Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note, pointing to the 1.4-percentage-point rise in the jobless rate since January last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that if the jobless figure was considered independently, it was likely that the central bank would cut rates in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada lost a net 1,400 jobs in June, Statistics Canada said, against analysts' predictions of 22,500 job gains, in further indications of weakness in economic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group, said the sharp rise in the unemployment rate will have many questioning whether Canada has entered a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lowering interest rates is the only way to soften the blow from upcoming mortgage renewals and keep any hope of a soft landing alive," he said, adding that the BoC would cut rates by 25 basis points this month and another two rate cuts in the three meetings thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said last month that the labour market had cooled reasonably in recent months, and that achieving the central bank's goal of cooling inflation did not need to involve a sharp rise in unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was even room for economic growth and jobs creation without imperiling the bank's target of 2 percent inflation, the governor said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday said positions in the Ukraine war were "far apart" and "many" steps would be needed to end the conflict after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have found that positions are far apart. The number of steps needed to end the war and bring about peace are many," the Hungarian leader told a press conference alongside Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in terms of dialogue and restoring dialogue, the first important step has been taken today and I will continue this work," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told Orban that Ukraine must abandon four regions in the east and south that Moscow claims as its own if Kyiv wants peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about the full withdrawal of all troops from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and from the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions," Putin said in televised remarks after what he called a "frank and useful" conversation with Orban in Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban informed Nato ahead of his visit to Moscow, alliance head Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, Viktor Orban is not representing Nato at these meetings. He's representing his own country," Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hungary agrees that Russia is responsible for the war. Russia is the perpetrator, and Russia can end this war today by stopping attacking Ukraine," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban unsettled the European Union and Nato allies by flying to Moscow to sit down for talks with Putin, with whom he has long fostered friendly relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said he viewed Orban as a representative for Europe, despite EU leaders emphasising that Orban was acting on his own initiative in an exclusively bilateral role with no mandate to speak for the bloc. (AFP)

    US job gains ease as unemployment edges higher

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Weak jobs data suggests the US economy is cooling steadily. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760448_1_20240705224017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US job gains eased slightly in June while unemployment edged up, government data showed on Friday, in a sign that the world's biggest economy is cooling steadily.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wage growth decelerated, although it still outpaced consumer inflation. But this has not translated into rosy sentiment over the broader economy, adding to President Joe Biden's challenges as he seeks re-election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country added 206,000 jobs last month, the US Labour Department said, marking a slower pace of hiring than May's revised 218,000 figure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gains still beat a Briefing.com consensus estimate of 185,000, signalling that the labour market remains relatively resilient despite high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jobless rate ticked up from 4.0 percent to 4.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, the figures point to a "very gradual, orderly cooling" in the market, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she pointed to signs of weakness, including downward revisions to April and May hiring numbers by a cumulative 111,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The uptick in unemployment, though narrow, also marks the highest level since November 2021 – ending a 30-month stretch where the rate stood at or below 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of overall gains came from government employment, noted Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. This means that headline gains do not paint a full picture of the labor market's health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other aspects of the data indicate a slowing job market," he said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temporary hires dropped by 49,000, indicating that business demand for labour is falling, Fratantoni said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wage growth slowed from 0.4 percent in May to 0.3 percent last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compared with a year ago, the increase was 3.9 percent – also easing from before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Weakening demand for labour will lead to further moderation in wage growth," said economist Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this is likely to bolster the US Federal Reserve's confidence that inflation is on a downward path to policymakers' 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest report comes on the back of a slump in activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, alongside easing inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While there is some way to go, these indicators will likely give the US central bank more confidence to begin cutting interest rates after holding them at a high level in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This move could, in turn, give the economy a boost. (AFP)

 China and Tajikistan have decided to elevate their ties to comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era during President Xi Jinping's visit to the Central Asia country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision was based on the current development needs of bilateral ties, the two countries said in a joint statement after Xi held talks with his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing and Dushanbe also announced they will jointly build a multimodal transport corridor linking China and Turkey via regional countries including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China and Tajikistan also expressed the willingness to continue deepening cooperation on the China-Europe freight train services.

 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Sichuan on Sunday for a three-day visit to know more about arrangements for the arrival of two giant pandas from the province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on Monday that the central government will send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a government statement, Lee and his delegation will visit the Dujiangyan Base of the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. He will also meet with leaders of Sichuan Province.

    'Govt mulls cutting Tai Lam Tunnel tolls'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government may introduce time-varying tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760439_1_20240705205800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government is considering various proposals that would reduce tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel after taking control of it in May next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, tolls for private cars and taxis stand at HK$58.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities have met representatives from various political parties to discuss the proposed changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One idea being floated is to charge private cars from HK$20 to HK$45, based on the time of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also proposals to lower the tolls for private cars and taxis to HK$35 or HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option under consideration is to keep the current tolls unchanged, but officials fear that may lead to congestion at nearby Tuen Mun Road, Tolo Highway and Ting Kau Bridge during the rush hour by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who is a member of Legco transport panel, called on the government to introduce time-varying tolls at the tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At one hand, we need to ensure that even during peak hours, Tai Lam Tunnel can continue to be a convenient and not very congested route for different users, especially for our commercial vehicles, because that's a very important corridor for Hong Kong logistics industry," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, the residents, they do have very high expectation of a toll reduction of the Tai Lam Tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien urged the government to lower tolls to less than HK$35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've always used the VC ratio, which is the volume capacity ratio of 1.2 as a basis of calculation. If we use VC ratio of 1, which means the capacity is equal to the volume, every single bridge and tunnel in Hong Kong will be considered overcapacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the couple of scenarios that they use all resulted in the Ting Kau Bridge having a volume capacity ratio less than 1.2. If that's the case, we still have room for the downward adjustment."

    Calls for more support for women to rejoin workplace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB says many women encounter difficulties when trying to find jobs after a break. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760429_1_20240705195809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called for greater support for women to re-enter the workforce as part of efforts to tackle a manpower shortage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said only 56 percent of women in Hong Kong are working, a figure that is lower than other regions of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said women who chose to leave their jobs to give birth or take care of their family members face difficulties when trying to return to the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is hard for women to go back to work after leaving for a while. They face difficulties such as low education background and no relevant experience, and there is not enough support for them. Is it a must for women to pick between family and work rather than having it all?” Quat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Associate professor Dai Haijing from the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Social Work Department said women still face workplace discrimination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe the gender effect is still there because the majority of caregivers in the world, they are women. Fathers are doing pretty well in Hong Kong compared with other places in the world... [while] filial daughters taking care of their ageing parents are being penalised in the labour market,” Dai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong turns out to be very conservative in terms of gender ideology; there should be some advocacy for gender equality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another DAB lawmaker, Frankie Ngan, urged the government to take the lead in expanding childcare services, such as setting up childcare centres in government facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also suggested that the Employees Retraining Board provide more flexible courses to mothers, among other ideas.

    Legco approves three percent civil service payrise
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers approved a three percent pay rise for civil servants. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760410_1_20240705172551.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday approved a three percent pay rise for all civil servants, with the increase backdated to the start of April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government asked for HK$8.7 billion to cover the rises, which also apply to teachers and those working at the ICAC and other subvented bodies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pay trend survey had pointed to increases of between 4.01 percent to 5.47 percent for civil servants of various ranks, but officials stressed those numbers were only one factor to consider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several unionist lawmakers said the government needs to explain further why it decided on rises lower than the survey indicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung described the three percent increase as reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She stressed that a key factor this year is the administration's deficit, and its goal of achieving a fiscal balance in three years or so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we have significant expenses this year, it will affect the government's progress in trying to achieve fiscal balance. So we have thought about this. We have tried to strike a balance with different factors," she told Legco's Finance Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it is not the case that we will not follow or deviate from the pay trend indicators. It would depend on the circumstances of the year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip said it's high time the government revamped the pay adjustment system for civil servants, saying some staff have left and other people don't want to join because workers get paid the same, regardless of their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Hong Kong could look to Singapore, which pays its government workers through different types of bonuses on top of a basic salary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said in response that officials would need to consider such a move carefully, including whether the public would accept the idea of civil servants receiving bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added, however, that she agreed officials need to work on ways to create more incentives for civil servants to perform even better.

    Starmer pledges to rebuild UK after election win

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer speaks at a reception in London to celebrate the Labour victory. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760411_1_20240705174724.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer vowed to rebuild Britain as its next prime minister after his Labour Party on Friday surged to a landslide victory in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of Conservative government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour won a massive majority in the 650-seat parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rishi Sunak's Conservatives suffered the worst performance in the party's long history as voters punished them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services and a series of scandals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did it," Starmer said in a victory speech. "Change begins now... We said we would end the chaos, and we will, we said we would turn the page, and we have. Today, we start the next chapter, begin the work of change, the mission of national renewal and start to rebuild our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election result has upended British politics. Labour won some 410 seats, an increase of 210, while the Conservatives, the western world's most successful party, lost about 250 lawmakers, including a record number of senior ministers and former Prime Minister Liz Truss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scottish National Party imploded, losing 38 seats, ending its own decade of dominance in Scotland and leaving its dream of independence for Scotland in tatters, while conversely the Irish nationalists Sinn Fein became Northern Ireland's largest party for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the populist right-wing Reform UK party, headed by Nigel Farage, the Brexit campaigner and friend of Donald Trump, won more than four million votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While it secured only four lawmakers, its impact on the outcome by siphoning vast tracts of Conservative support will make Farage a major thorn in the side of the two major parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A glum Sunak conceded defeat and will meet King Charles later to formally resign before Starmer is appointed in his place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides," Sunak said. "There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates... I am sorry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party. Thanks to the quirk of Britain's first past the post system and a low turnout, Labour's triumph was achieved with fewer votes than it secured in 2017 and 2019, the latter its worst result for 84 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pound and British stocks and government bonds rose on Friday, but Starmer comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, have already been scaled back while Starmer has promised not to raise taxes for "working people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Likewise, he has promised to scrap the Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but with migration a key electoral issue, he will be under pressure himself to find a way to stop tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel from France on small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't promise you it will be easy," Starmer said. "Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. It's hard work. Patient, determined, work, and we will have to get moving immediately." (Reuters)

    'Many people disappointed with plastic cutlery ban'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Greenpeace argues that switching to eco-friendly cutlery does little to help the environment, since the disposable items still end up in the city's landfills. File photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760402_1_20240705164848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Greenpeace survey suggests many people are sceptical about the recent ban on restaurants giving customers plastic cutlery, saying it does little to reduce waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The green group interviewed around 1,000 adults in May, seeking their views on the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 60 percent said they felt the new rules have little impact on waste reduction, while seven in 10 said they still threw away disposable cutlery made from alternative materials such as pulp or bamboo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said on Friday that it means little that the cutlery is eco-friendly, if it still ends up in landfills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an effort to raise awareness on sustainability, the group collaborated with local artist Kevin Cheung to create an eight-metre whale-shaped installation from over 2,000 pieces of disposable tableware. It will be on display at the West Kowloon Cultural District until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This whale shows the volume of disposable cutlery used ... our environment is still suffering," Tam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace is calling on authorities to subsidise restaurants which provide reusable tableware with takeaway orders, saying it is the most direct means to cut down waste.
