<div class="itemFullText">
 The four fencers representing the SAR in the Olympics on Tuesday said they hope to use the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait next month as final preparation for Paris in July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Star fencer Vivian Kong has won several large events, including the Fujairah Women's Epee World Cup 2024 and the Barcelona Women's Epee World Cup 2024, but has yet to win an Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she still has to give it her all, even though this will be her third Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's like psychologically and mentally [where] I need to be calm and that's like usually the hardest part when we compete especially in foreign competitions. Technically, it's all my coach [Octavian Zidaru]. He knows every action we work on," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's always like this one higher, this one lower, this one point more accurately, so there's always something wrong with my actions, so I have to work hard to make him happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Olympic gold-medallist Edgar Cheung said he doesn't want to let the pressure to win another medal affect his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the competition in Kuwait will give him another practice opportunity before the Games, adding that it's vital to perform to the best of his ability and enjoy the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, there are challenges but for me, it is like preparing well for myself, and give all my best, and afterwards, we will see what happens. I think me and Vivian had quite a good experience about the Olympics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the two of the rest, one is my ex-roommate so we are friends. We have been talking about the Olympics, how it is and I just told them to enjoy and to have fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Epee fencer Cedric Ho said he is excited to have booked his place in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though I'm really excited, I do want to bring that energy down a little and enter the Olympics with a calm mindset," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be going to the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait at the end of June, and those results will determine our rankings in the Olympics. I will use that competition as a prep for the Games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for Daphne Chan, she said she doesn't have specific expectations from the Games, and is just looking forward to learning from her teammates and staying focused for Paris.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers will soon be able to watch a series of special RTHK Olympics-related programmes in Putonghua, Cantonese and English, including some produced on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
   Sign language and audio description services will also be available.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This comes after RTHK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Guangdong Radio and Television on Monday, and another with Beijing Radio and Television Station (BRTV) on Tuesday, to jointly deliver news related to the Paris Olympics and Paralympics 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China Media Group is also a cooperation partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some of the special shows will be produced locally, featuring issues related to Environmental, social, and governance, to echo the Paris Games’ goal of being the greenest Games ever.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will also be a raft of programmes produced by the Guangdong and Beijing TV stations, with content ranging from local culture, behind-the-scenes stories of the Winter Olympics 2022, as well as individual athletes’ preparations for this summer's Games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a signing ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the programmes will promote a sports culture in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This allows all Hongkongers to cheer for athletes from the national team and Team Hong Kong, while uniting all sectors of the society and encouraging residents to do more exercise,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Meanwhile, we hope that the broadcast of the Paris Olympics and the Paralympics Games 2024 will further spur local catering and retail activities, boosting the local economy by creating a ‘multiplier effect’,” he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li Xiulei, deputy chief editor of BRTV, said the cooperation between Hong Kong and Beijing marks the beginning of a deepening of cultural exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I hope Hong Kong viewers and listeners could learn about Beijing’s profound culture via the programmes by BRTV,” she said, adding that she hopes the two cities will further strengthen collaboration to provide more diversified programmes for residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong government has purchased broadcasting rights for this year's Olympics, allowing RTHK, TVB, Hoy TV and ViuTV to show the Games on their free-to-air channels.

    Increase penalties over illicit cigarettes: customs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Customs has recorded over 7,000 cases related to illicit cigarette activities in the first five months. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755065_1_20240528175043.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Tuesday proposed increasing the penalties for crimes involving illicit cigarettes, after they detected a 50 percent rise in cases this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Customs recorded over 7,000 cases in the first five months, which was a 54 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An assistant customs commissioner, Lai Chi-wing, said most illicit cigarettes were shipped into Hong Kong before the pandemic, but more travellers had been bringing in illicit cigarettes into the city after the border reopened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The total number of incoming passengers bringing in dutiable cigarettes was over 5,000 [from February to May], so this is not a small figure. So we try to target these incoming passengers bringing in small amount of cigarettes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials recommended increasing the maximum imprisonment term from two to seven years, and to double the maximum fine to HK$2 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also proposed including the offence of illicit cigarettes under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance, as cases may involve syndicates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs proposed that cigarettes being sold lower than the tax amount should be presumed as duty-not-paid goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out there were packs of cheap white cigarettes being sold at HK$40 in the market, which was even lower than the required tax of HK$66 for a packet of 20 cigarettes.

    'Turn south Lantau into a resort town'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it's exploring ways to turn south Lantau into an eco-tourism hub. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755060_1_20240528174959.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday called on authorities to speed up its long-standing plan to turn south Lantau into a tourist spot, with some urging the government to make it a high-end vacation resort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials told a Legco meeting they were collecting the public's views over the next two months on building a pier and accommodation facilities in Cheung Sha, as well as setting up a water sports centre at Hong Kong’s longest beach there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the proposed South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor plan, an uphill chairlift would also be built in Cheung Sha, and the neighbouring areas of Shek Pik, Shui Hau and Pui O would get walkways around a reservoir, along the shore of a sand flat, or on treetops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But legislators like Andrew Lam said the government had earlier made such plans in its blueprint to develop Lantau back in 2017, and had asked authorities to act on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undersecretary for Development David Lam said the government would try to build more parking spaces, family playgrounds and a visitor’s centre in the area in a year or two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The undersecretary said preliminary assessments on the environment and infrastructure had shown the proposals would not have any adverse impact on south Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is estimated the corridor would attract 4,000 to 6,000 more visitors a day during holidays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have to access the reception capacity of Lantau as a whole because it wouldn't be ideal if too many visitors are going to the area and destroy the local characteristics. So maybe we'll implement an online booking system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said authorities could transform south Lantau into an upscale vacation destination featuring high-end resort hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said authorities were liaising with developers and had received some positive response.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed "grave concern" over Israel's military operations in Rafah, where an Israeli strike killed dozens in a displaced persons camp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China urged "all parties to protect civilians and civilian facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing also said it "strongly urges Israel to listen to the appeals of the international community and to stop its attacks on Rafah".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been calling for an immediate ceasefire since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war in October last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, President Xi Jinping has called for an international peace conference to resolve the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting later on Tuesday over Israel's operations in the southern Gaza border city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement centre, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation. Israel said it was looking into the "tragic accident".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,200 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry run by Hamas. (AFP)

    Douyin to tighten regulations for viral posts

    <![CDATA[<img afp"="" alt="Douyin says it guides creators to record " file="" good="" lives".="" photo:="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755047_1_20240528163706.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto" true,=""/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese social media giant Douyin has said it will start cracking down on posts that use so-called "hot events" to boost views, after state media reported that accounts for multiple influencers known for showing off their lavish lifestyles had been blocked.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Douyin said these videos use scenarios, such as staged medical crises or domestic disputes, in a bid to go viral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Douyin guides creators to record true, good lives," the company added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes after Global Times newspaper earlier this month said the Douyin account belonging to content creator Wang Hongquan – which had more than 4.3 million followers – was no longer accessible last week amid a crackdown on influencers who flaunt their wealth online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang's Douyin page had featured videos where he showed off designer outfits, first-class flights and his jade jewellery collection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A screenshot of his Douyin profile page showed that the account had been banned for violating the platform's regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese social media platforms, including Tencent, Kuaishou, Weibo and Little Red Book, had jointly issued a statement on May 15 saying they will crack down on those showing off their wealth, according to Global Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douyin said they removed over 4,701 pieces of inappropriate content and closed 11 accounts from May 1 to 7, while Little Red Book cleaned up more than 4,200 posts and shut 383 accounts in two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, "Sister Abalone", a woman who filmed her elaborately decorated mansion and was regularly seen dripping with diamond and pearl necklaces, also appeared to have been targeted, with her videos on the YouTube-like Bilibili site no longer visible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And "Young Master Bo", an influencer who filmed himself test-driving Rolls-Royces and splurging on rare Hermes Birkin bags, was also missing from Douyin, with his account showing an error message that said he had "violated relevant laws and regulations". (Additional reporting by AFP)

    India, Bangladesh count the cost of killer cyclone

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A boy wades through water as cyclone Remal hits Bangladesh. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755043_1_20240528161404.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 12 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse," the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no immediate details of the number trapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather experts in Bangladesh said the deadly cyclone was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting they'd experienced, blaming climate change for the shift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of its land duration, it is one of the longest in the country's history," Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department told AFP, adding it had battered the country for more than 36 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, cyclone Aila, which hammered Bangladesh in 2009, lasted around 34 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slow-moving – and therefore longer-lasting – storms bring greater destruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've seen many storms in my life but nothing like this cyclone," said Asma Khatun, an 80-year-old widow who lives with her son, a fisherman in Bangladesh's hard-hit coastal town of Patuakhali.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before, the storm came and went away... now it doesn't seem to go away. The incessant pouring and heavy wind kept us stuck for days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahman said the cyclone triggered massive rains, with some cities receiving at least 200 millimetres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm surges breached multiple embankments, meaning seawater flooded into farmland, damaged freshwater fish farms common along the coast, or corrupted drinking water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh's state minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman said 3.75 million people had been affected by the cyclone, more than 35,000 homes were destroyed, and another 115,000 damaged. (Reuters/AFP)

 Authorities in Shanghai have unveiled a set of measures to provide further targeted support for homebuyers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine measures unveiled on Monday aim to meet the diversified living needs of residents, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include easing home-purchase restrictions further for non-Shanghai residents and divorced couples, and allowing families with two or more children to purchase an additional home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai also said it would reduce the minimum down payment for commercial housing mortgages to 20 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement followed similar moves in major cities such as Hangzhou and Xi'an this month, reducing purchase restrictions for first-time buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many mainland cities had imposed restrictions and tough credit requirements on home purchases well over a decade ago in an effort to tamp down soaring prices and speculation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they are now reversing those policies in a bid to stem an economic slump characterised by a debt crisis among developers, low demand and falling prices. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong triathlete Jason Ng has beaten Ayan Beisenbayev from Kazakhstan for the remaining spot in Paris Olympic qualification reserved for the highest-ranked Asian nation or region that hadn't already made it through to the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng had been going neck to neck against Beisenbayev for the remaining place, after Japan's top three athletes secured spots based on individual Olympic rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the weekend's Asia Triathlon Cup, Ng was disqualified for wearing a helmet during the running portion of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, given that Beisenbayev failed to finish on the podium to accumulate the points he needed, Hong Kong were able to win a spot in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng secured the 33rd ticket for the SAR delegation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he expects half of Hong Kong's companies would be using artificial intelligence by the end of this year, adding that technology and innovation is the government's priority.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the UBS Asian Investment Conference, Lee said the SAR understands the important role technology plays in the future of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong continues to evolve. As we embrace new technologies and sustainable practices, we strengthen our position as the foreign investment gateway to mainland China, and as the conduit for mainland enterprises to invest in the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation is a central priority of the Hong Kong SAR government. That includes applying AI technology to fast track our smart city and digital government ambitions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the government was launching more than 100 digital government and smart-city initiatives and expediting the establishment of an AI Supercomputing Centre in Cyberport.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics clinched the Eastern Conference championship on Monday with a 105-102 win over the Indiana Pacers, sweeping the series 4-0 and booking a spot in the NBA Finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Celtics will face the winner of the Western Conference finals, where the Dallas Mavericks hold a 3-0 over the Minnesota Timberwolves ahead of Tuesday's game four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics win in Indianapolis was their seventh straight in the post-season but they left it late against a Pacers team again without injured star guard Tyrese Haliburton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown once again proved decisive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hit a step through to level at 102-102 with 2:40 left in the fourth, then superbly rose to block Andrew Nembhard at the rim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With 45 seconds remaining Brown found Derrick White in the corner who sank the three-point jumper that ultimately clinched the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nembhard, who had 24 points, 10 assists and six rebounds for the Pacers, missed a three-pointer with 33 seconds left which would have tied the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown led Boston's scoring with 29 points and Jayson Tatum had 26 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics return to the finals two years after losing to the Golden State Warriors as they search for their first NBA title since 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the third time in the four series games that Indiana had lost after holding leads or being tied in the final minute of a game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Expectations will be raised for next year, which is good," said Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are challenges to meet over the summer for our guys to get better, all of us involved need to get better," he added. (AFP)

    Govt not given up on waste charging: environment chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green groups disagreed with the government's decision to postpone waste charging indefinitely, but the environment minister stressed officials had not given up on the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration announced on Monday it would not implement the pay-as-you-throw scheme on August 1 as originally planned, citing concerns among residents and the limited coverage of recycling facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said it was not suitable to set a date for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our society has to be mature enough to accept this approach. Also, when the policy is introduced, its design has to be easy and accepted by the public, and be straight forward for frontline workers," Tse told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the coming year, we will of course expand our efforts on waste reduction and recycling, as well as promotion. On the other hand, we will also look at how we can enhance the scheme, gauge public sentiment, and see whether we have the conditions to introduce waste charging. We are not giving up on this concept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the government might roll out waste charging in phases if officials decided to re-introduce the scheme in future, so that it's more easily accepted by the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edwin Lau, the founder and executive director of The Green Earth, told the same programme that the decision in postponing the scheme reflected a lack of faith and determination in the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the government's poll showed a majority of residents opposed waste charging, he understood the business sector was ready for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many large companies and organisations said they had been prepared and had no issue [with the policy]. I have also asked some from the middle class, they said [paying] HK$50 a month was a very small amount," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government appeared to have amplified negative responses to the policy, but did not focus on positive feedbacks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Wendell Chan from Friends of the Earth called on the government to dig deeper to understand public opinion on the policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we need to know is why opinion shifted, what happened there, what caused people to not like this scheme," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we went in-depth enough, in terms of analysing these problems in order to tackle them. The problem is that the government, right now, is way too willing to back down instead of trying to resolve these issues."

    Security still a factor in trilateral talks: academic

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political academic in Shanghai has described trilateral talks between China, Japan and South Korea as a step in the right direction, although he said the security stances of Tokyo and Seoul may be problematic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Josef Gregory Mahoney from East China Normal University said Japan and South Korea had recently been gravitating towards the Aukus defence pact - between the US, Australia and the UK - and it remained to be seen how things would play out after the US presidential election later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main issues of whether Japan and South Korea will continue to draw closer to the US, as we've seen, especially since President Yoon took office in Seoul and whether or not we'll see a change in the US presidency this November and how that would affect US strategic positioning where we've seen, of course, Biden playing a very powerful role in advancing the Indo-Pacific concept and moving forward with Aukus," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And, of course, we've had recent reports that South Korea and Japan will be cooperating with Aukus, which most people interpret as a new sort of Pacific-based Nato that is the foremost part of American containment strategies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-day talks in Seoul, which began on Sunday, were the first direct dialogue between the three countries in more than four years with Premier Li Qiang meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Mahoney also said he did not think a free trade pact would emerge soon, despite the countries agreeing to work towards one.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, called for more recycling points. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754977_1_20240528075506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There has been a mixed reaction to the news that the government has indefinitely postponed the roll-out of its waste charging scheme. Some lawmakers say they back the decision, noting that a trial had found many concerns about the pay-as-you-throw initiative. Others insisted that Hong Kong still has to find ways to better manage its waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, says a delay is reasonable. But he says officials should now get back to the original point of the scheme and better promote recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Waste charging is only one of the many ways to reduce waste and waste treatment is a worldwide problem," he said. "One important thing is that we have to put more recycling facilities, more recycling points and shops so that we can push up recycling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said she supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”. But Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.

 A member of Egypt's security forces was killed in a shooting incident near the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and an investigation is under way, Egypt's military spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's military had earlier said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few hours ago (Monday), a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians," the Israeli military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Monday, Egypt warned against compromising the security and safety of its security forces, a high-level source told Egypt's state-linked Al Qahera News, adding that Egypt would take necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Egyptian soldier stationed on a watchtower had reacted to seeing an armoured vehicle carrying Israeli troops cross a boundary line near the border while the soldiers pursued and killed several Palestinians, two Egyptian security sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier opened fire and Israeli forces fired back, killing him, the sources said, sparking an exchange of gunfire between the two sides. Several Israeli soldiers were wounded and the force fell back, and one Egyptian was wounded, the sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel seized control of the Rafah border crossing from the Gaza side of the border earlier this month as it stepped up its military offensive in the area, drawing strong criticism from Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt is concerned that Palestinians could be displaced from southern Gaza by the offensive, and has also repeatedly accused Israel of holding up deliveries of humanitarian aid to the territory, which Israel denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and have cooperated closely on security issues around the borders between Israel, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, and the Gaza Strip. They jointly upheld a blockade of Gaza after Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British lawmaker Lucy Allan, who had said she would not stand in the national election, was suspended from the governing Conservative Party on Monday after endorsing the candidate for the right-wing Reform UK party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This marks another setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has been on the campaign trail since calling a general election last week. Dozens of Conservative lawmakers have already said they won't be standing in the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Allan, 59, who was the Conservative member of parliament (MP) for the English town of Telford and has been an MP for nine years, said on social media that she was supporting Reform's Alan Adams to be the constituency's next MP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Conservative Party spokesperson said she had been suspended from the party with "immediate effect," adding that "a vote for Reform is a vote for (opposition Labour leader) Keir Starmer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poll conducted by More in Common published a day after Sunak called the election on Wednesday showed 44 percent support for Labour and 27 percent for the Conservatives, with the right-wing Reform UK party at 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, former Conservative Party Deputy Chairman Lee Anderson, who was suspended from the party over accusations of Islamophobia, defected to Reform, which has Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage as its honorary president. (Reuters)

    Israel launches probe as leaders condemn Rafah strike

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong," he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on "precise intelligence", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said he was "outraged" over Israel's latest attacks. "These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians," he said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling against action in Rafah must be respected. (Reuters)

    Nadal crashes out in likely French Open farewell

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal salutes the Roland Garos fans after what could be his final French Open match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754957_1_20240528005047.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafa Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title. (Reuters)

    North Korean rocket explodes in satellite launch

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said its attempt to launch a new military reconnaissance satellite ended in failure on Monday when a newly developed rocket engine exploded in flight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The attempt came just hours after Pyongyang issued a warning that it would try to launch a satellite by June 4, in what would have been its second spy satellite in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead, the launch became the nuclear-armed North's latest failure, following two other fiery crashes last year. It successfully placed its first spy satellite in orbit in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage," the deputy director general of North Korea's National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An intial analysis suggested that the cause was a newly developed liquid fuel rocket motor, but other possible causes were being investigated, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in South Korea and Japan had earlier reported that the launch seemed to have failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10.44pm, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JCS said it had detected a large amount of debris from the rocket in the sea just two minutes after launch, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The object launched by North Korea disappeared over the Yellow Sea, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government presumes nothing had entered the space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These launches are in violation of relevant security council resolutions and are a serious matter concerning the safety of our people," Hayashi said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday were largely sympathetic towards the decision to suspend the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
   Speaking to reporters after a meeting at the Legislative Council, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the ultimate goal of the scheme was to promote recycling and reduce waste, but he acknowledged the public had misconceptions about the plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The public misunderstood that this whole thing is actually tantamount to a poll tax, which means that everyone has to start paying more taxes because everyone needs to generate garbage," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Most people are not aware of the fact that, no - that is not the end game. The end game is to reduce wastage generation. To do that, you need to do the wastage collection, the separation, so that some can be recycled. The whole world is doing that, and I cannot believe Hong Kong should just surrender and forget it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We insist the policy should be carried out because it is environmental protection. We feel disappointed that [over] the last two years the government [had inadequate] preparation to implement the policy," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Quat urged the government to continue educating the public and to provide support for the city's recycling industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think now is a very good timing for the government to promote recycling and the reduction of waste. Because going through all this education process, a lot of citizens think that they support environmental protection and they want to participate in waste reduction," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Quat also suggested the government introduce additional incentives, such as a rewards scheme, to encourage people to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of the Japanese anime character Doraemon can now catch the time-travelling robot cat on some trains, as well as at the Siu Hong Light Rail stop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leading up to the Doraemon exhibition on July 13 at the Avenue of Stars, the MTR Corporation has put up posters and decorations from the series at the stop, and has transformed some Light Rail, East Rail Line and Airport Express trains with the Doraemon theme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trains are covered in Doraemon blue, while the doors are pink to depict the "Anywhere Door" portal to any destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam, speaking for the organisers of the Doraemon event, said he hopes people can enjoy the iconic character during their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Doraemon is everyone's friend. We want to bring more joy and more creativity to people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "MTR is one of the important daily [modes of] transportation in Hong Kong, so when people can see it everyday, we are happy to share the joy with everybody. Of course, people can also catch the train to our exhibition."

 Police have arrested 20 people after a gang allegedly gave foreign domestic helpers cash to open bank accounts used to process HK$10 million in criminal proceeds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Among the suspects picked up on suspicion of conspiracy to launder money were 14 Indonesian migrant workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A helper is suspected of having acted as an intermediary for a syndicate to recruit others, with meetings arranged at locations such as parks, fast food restaurants and hotel rooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers on Monday said they believe the helpers were paid between HK$1,000 and HK$2,500 for opening accounts, which were then managed by the syndicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For foreign domestic workers, the amount [allegedly] paid is relatively high compared to their salaries. That also was the main incentive for them to [allegedly] sell their bank accounts," said Chief Inspector So Chi-bing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank accounts are suspected of being linked to 39 cases of fraud involving losses of HK$5.4 million, police added.

 RTHK announced on Monday that the broadcaster will join hands with Guangdong Radio and Television station (GRT) to produce various sports programmes including a documentary on legendary football players in both places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two stations also agreed to play each other's programmes about the upcoming Paris Olympics in order to broaden the audience's horizons and promote interactive exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deputy director for broadcasting, Christine Wai, signed a memorandum of understanding with the head of GRT's sports channel in Shenzhen on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "RTHK has been actively promoting cooperation and exchanges with various media organisations on the mainland. In addition to sports, we have also collaborated on television programmes that promote Chinese history and culture, and foster a sense of patriotism. These efforts aim to help Hong Kong people integrate into the overall development of the country and cultivate a sense of national identity," Wai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of GRT, Zhong Shixun, said the new agreement would bring high-quality development cooperation and initiate new collaborative projects that will bring mutual benefits and win-win outcomes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport workers’ union on Monday called on the government to ban unlicensed ride-hailing services and address the plight of the taxi trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Motor Transport Workers General Union said cab drivers have suffered a more than 30 percent drop in business in recent years due to competition with illegal taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos circulating online appear to show cabbies posing as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has urged people to leave such matters to law enforcement agencies, but the union’s principal vice-chairperson, Chong Wing-tak, said taxi drivers are not convinced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do drivers perform sting operations? It's because of a lack of enforcement action by the government, transport authorities, and the police. We have endured this for more than ten years. We can't bear it anymore, so some drivers have organised these sting operations," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Ho, the union's director of the taxi driver branch, described illegal cab drivers as "irresponsible", noting that any injuries that occur during unlicensed ride-hailing services are not covered by insurance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the Transport and Logistics Bureau is expected to report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to discuss speeding up talks for a trilateral free trade agreement, according to a joint statement released on Monday following their three-way summit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries also reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula at the ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit brought together Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three countries announced they would keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a trilateral free trade deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said they had agreed not to turn "economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the leaders had "decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After their talks, Li, Kishida and Yoon joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade among the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li called on relevant parties to exercise restraint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit, a move that violates United Nations sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would undermine regional and global peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said China, Japan and South Korea should properly handle sensitive issues and differences, and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trilateral cooperation system should be strengthened. We have decided to hold trilateral summits on a regular basis," Yoon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace, and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral meeting. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also highlighted the limited coverage of recycling facilities, pointing out that the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also said the scheme had increased the workload and pressure on cleaners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong's economic recovery had not lived up to expectations and the implementation of the scheme could have a negative impact on businesses, particularly in the catering sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also addressed the misconception that the government's aim with the waste charging scheme was to generate more revenue. He clarified that the primary objective of the scheme was to improve waste management practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of these factors, the government had taken the decision to shelve the waste charging scheme, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed the government remained committed to improving waste management and recycling practices in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government would step up publicity work to raise awareness of waste management and improve the city’s recycling network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to report back to Legco on its work by the middle of next year, he said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun says the administration has to help low-income workers who don't have a lot of bargaining power. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754864_1_20240527142045.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Monday brushed aside concerns that a new mechanism for setting the statutory minimum wage was unfair to employers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Executive Council approved recommendations to review the minimum wage annually instead of every two years. There would also be a new formula for calculating the hourly pay rate, which bars any reduction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmakers representing the business sector said the new mechanism only focuses on employees and gives workers the false hope of an annual pay rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, in response, said there is a need to help 17,000 low-income workers, who only account for 0.6 percent of the workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have very little bargaining power under the market mechanism. There are a lot of constraints on these workers, be it their abilities and other reasons, it is difficult for them to earn a decent pay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to reassure them that their wages would only go up rather than down. If they have to worry about the prospects of a wage cut, then it would add to their plight."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Papua New Guinea government on Monday said a landslide last Friday buried more than 2,000 people and that it had formally asked for international help.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government figure was around three times more than a United Nations’ estimate of 670.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Centre said the landslide “buried more than 2,000 people alive” and caused “major destruction”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A once-bustling remote hillside village in Enga province was almost wiped out when a chunk of Mount Mungalo collapsed in the early hours of Friday morning, burying scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said the number of possible deaths could change as rescue efforts were expected to continue for days. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Atlanta Braves star outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. is out for the remainder of the season after suffering a complete tear of the ACL in his left knee on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Acuña, the reigning National League MVP, injured the knee in the first inning of Sunday afternoon's 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates. Despite telling reporters that he did not think he tore the ligament, Acuña underwent an MRI exam and the Braves announced the results late Sunday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old will undergo surgery at a later date, the team said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acuña led off Sunday's game with a double to right-centre field off Pirates left-hander Martin Perez. He made a move toward third base with Marcell Ozuna batting and fell awkwardly to the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He remained on the ground for several minutes before slowly limping off the field. Jarred Kelenic replaced Acuña in the Atlanta lineup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I saw the catcher throwing the ball back to the pitcher very slow," Acuña said through an interpreter. "I was timing that so I could steal third. But in that moment, he threw it hard. So I had to come back, and that's when I felt it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Braves manager Brian Snitker called Acuña's injury "very concerning" before the results of his testing came in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acuña tore the ACL in his right knee on July 10, 2021, and returned 9 1/2 months later early in the 2022 season. He also sprained his left ACL in May 2018 and was sidelined for just more than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finishes his abbreviated seventh MLB season with a .250 batting average, four home runs and 15 RBIs in 49 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first player in MLB history to accomplish a 40-home run, 70-steal season, Acuña is a career .289 hitter with 165 homers and 417 RBIs in 722 games. He's a four-time All-Star and was the unanimous NL MVP in 2023. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.

  <br/>
  State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 66 points and Dallas surged home in a 116-107 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday that gave the Mavericks a 3-0 stranglehold on their NBA Western Conference final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latest thriller in the series, this time in Dallas, came after the Mavs won games one and two in Minneapolis by a total of four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a fourth quarter that saw the teams trade the lead seven times, the star Mavs duo spearheaded a closing 12-3 scoring run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks will have their first chance to clinch the series when they host game four on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No team has rallied from 3-0 down to win an NBA playoff series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic and Irving each finished with 33 points, Doncic adding seven rebounds and five assists and Irving producing 14 of his points in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  P.J. Washington scored 16 points, draining a three-pointer that put Dallas up for good, 107-104, with 3:38 to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Gafford blocked three shots for Dallas, including a monster rejection on Mike Conley in the final minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 26 points, but had just four in the fourth quarter. Anthony Edwards missed all four of his attempts in the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bruising contest saw the Mavericks lose Dereck Lively early in the second quarter after the rookie reserve took a knee to the back of the head from a leaping Karl-Anthony Towns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frightening moment brought Mavs coach Jason Kidd out to check on Lively, who had already taken a painful knee to the groin from Towns trying to guard him under the basket. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group rallied as much as 95 percent on Monday morning after the firm resumed trading following a share transfer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company, which is the EV unit of embattled property developer China Evergrande, on Sunday said 29 percent of its shares, or 3.14 billion, were expected to immediately change hands after liquidators reached a preliminary agreement with an unidentified buyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, subject to due diligence, includes an option for the buyer to take an additional 29.5 percent of the shares, or about 3.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market value of the total shares involved is about HK$2.41 billion, based on the HK$0.38 per share before the trading suspension on May 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday, also includes a possible credit line to be arranged by the buyer to finance the company’s ongoing operations and the development of its electric vehicle businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of the EV unit rallied to HK$0.74 per share shortly after its trading resumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EV maker is faced with a severe shortage of capital, with its Tianjin factory having ceased production at the beginning of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been struggling since its parent firm got sucked into a property crisis in China in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trading in the shares of Evergrande remains suspended.

    Divided views on future of waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opinion remained split on the best way forward for a citywide waste charging scheme, with some lawmakers urging authorities to shelve the plan and green groups calling for a timeline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government would shelve the pay-as-you-throw scheme scheduled to take effect from August 1, with lawmakers expected to discuss its fate during a Legco panel meeting on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told an RTHK programme that it was "irresponsible" to put the plan on the back-burner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe this won't help solve the waste problem in Hong Kong. Government departments should take the lead in implementing the waste charging scheme," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why not do it in phases first, instead of ignoring the issue and pretending that nothing's happened? This will waste a bill that's been on hold for 20 years, and Hong Kong will lose its chance to reduce waste."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a legislator and industry representatives told an RTHK programme that they welcome the move because the city was simply not ready for the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's more appropriate to shelve [the scheme] indefinitely. We should look at it practically. We've come up with a date before, but it didn't happen because the conditions were not met," said DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau added putting the plan on hold doesn't mean a stop in waste recycling and education work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that the catering industry was concerned about manpower shortages and rising operating costs if the scheme went as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five concern groups - including Civic Exchange, Green Power, Greenpeace, The Green Earth, and Greeners Action - wrote to the chief executive and asked for no more delay in the implementation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's star swimmer Siobhan Haughey snapped up three gold medals in the first leg of the Mare Nostrum Swim Tour in France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Olympic medallist won her first gold on day one in the 100m breaststroke in the town of Canet-en-Roussillon, where she finished with a time of 1 minute, 7.01 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey then captured her second gold of the session with a stunning time of 1 minute, 55.39 seconds in the women's 200m freestyle, ultimately beating the pack by over three seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On day two, she sealed her third gold medal, in the 100m freestyle event in 52.55 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Ian Ho, who like Haughey has qualified for the Paris Olympics this summer, won bronze in the men's 50m freestyle event with a time of 22.38 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was only .01 seconds behind the silver medallist, Dylan Carter of Trinidad and Tobago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next leg of the tour is due to take place from May 29 to May 30 in Barcelona.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Profits of China's major industrial firms increased 4.3 percent year on year in the first four months of the year, official data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth rate was the same with that registered in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For April alone, profits were up 4 percent, versus a 3.5 percent slide in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial firms with an annual main business revenue of at least 20 million yuan saw their combined profits reach 2.09 trillion yuan during the January-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pickup in earnings followed export-led growth in factory output over the past month while retail sales unexpectedly slowed, underscoring uneven recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Domestic effective demand remains insufficient while the external environment is still complicated and severe," said NBS statistician Wei Ning in a separate statement, noting that the foundation for improvement in industrial profits needs to be consolidated. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia will visit China this week, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaders will from May 28 to June 1 "pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation will be Bahrain's King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China continues its role a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and President Xi Jinping has called for an "international peace conference" to resolve the fighting. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are investigating the death on Sunday of a cyclist in a village near Tai Po who apparently lost control of her bicycle while riding downhill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old woman was riding down Tai Mei Tuk Road towards Tai Mei Tuk town centre at around 7pm when she rammed into a drop barrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was taken unconscious to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in Tai Po, where she was declared dead about an hour after the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Territories North special traffic investigations team is looking into the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Mei Tuk is a popular destination for cyclists and hikers, located on the edge of the Plover Clove reservoir and country park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, officers in Kowloon West are continuing to look into the deaths of a motorcycle rider and his passenger in Mong Kok in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old motorcyclist and a 24-year-old woman were on a motorbike that collided with a taxi at the junction of Argyle Street and Nathan Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The taxi driver, 27, suffered limb injuries along with his 38-year-old passenger. A 69-year-old man who was walking past the scene suffered facial injuries from flying fragments in the crash. All three men required hospital treatment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tornado-spawning storms swept across parts of the central United States, killing at least a dozen people and leaving a trail of destruction as forecasters warned of more severe weather over the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least seven people, including children, were killed in Texas when a powerful tornado struck communities in the north central part of the state near the Oklahoma border on Saturday night, Ray Sappington, the sheriff of Cooke County, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two children, aged two and five, were among the victims, Sappington said. Numerous injuries were reported, Cooke County officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the scale of the disaster came into full view on Sunday, officials were wrapping up search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sheriff said some of the many trailer homes in the hardest-hit area were "completely gone" and others had suffered massive damage from the storm which Sappington estimated left a quarter-mile wide path of destruction for three to four miles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tornado also crossed into Denton County, northwest of Dallas, on Saturday night, damaging homes and other property, and knocking down power lines. Officials said that "a number of individuals" with injuries were transported to area hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of customers were without power across a large swath of the country, including in Arkansas, Missouri and Texas on Sunday, according to poweroutages.us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in Arkansas also reported several storm-related fatalities, including one in Benton County, two in Marion County and a 73-year-old woman in Baxter county. Responding authorities described roads closed and clogged with debris, downed trees and power lines, homes and businesses destroyed, as well as numerous injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storms caused widespread damage and at least two fatalities in parts of Oklahoma, where officials activated an Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate efforts statewide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indiana, adverse weather delayed the start of the famed Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, or Indy 500, car race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest bout of extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through a rural Iowa town, killing four people. (Reuters)

 North Korea has notified Japan of its plan to launch a rocket carrying a space satellite towards the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and shared a view that North Korea's satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would be in violation of UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officials agreed to demand North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an emailed release. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton won promotion back to the Premier League by beating Leeds United 1-0 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, earning an immediate return to England’s top tier in a game considered the richest in world football.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Adam Armstrong was the match-winner as his first-half goal was enough to see off a Leeds side that struggled to muster a meaningful response, with substitute Daniel James coming closest when his shot hit the bar late in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton join Championship winners Leicester City and runners-up Ipswich Town in the Premier League next season, the latter promoted after a 22-year absence from the top flight, while the Foxes, like Saints, went up at the first attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton got the decisive goal after 24 minutes when Armstrong latched onto a through ball by Will Smallbone and slid it past keeper Illan Meslier for his 24th goal of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promotion means Saints are set to receive a windfall of at least US$178 million, according to analysis from Deloitte’s Sports Business Group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rewards on offer resulted in a cagey affair with a lack of clear chances and Southampton would have been pleased to see Leeds substitute Italy winger Wilfried Gnonto and Championship Player of the Year Crysencio Summerville in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine minutes of stoppage time gave Daniel Farke's trailing Yorkshire side hope and they huffed and puffed but failed to break down the excellent Saints defence. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc celebrated a boyhood dream come true on Sunday as the first home winner of Formula One's showcase Monaco Grand Prix since Louis Chiron triumphed in 1931.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was also the first time the 26-year-old had stood on the Monaco podium in six attempts and came after two standing starts from pole position in a race halted when first-lap collisions took out a fifth of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished runner-up, 7.1 seconds behind after 78 laps without a chance to overtake on a street circuit that often produces processional races, and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot," said Leclerc, who screamed over the radio as he took a chequered flag waved by France soccer forward Kylian Mbappe while the crowd erupted and Prince Albert gave a royal thumbs up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the race that made me dream of becoming a Formula One driver one day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's championship leader and 2023 Monaco winner Max Verstappen started and finished sixth, the third time in eight races this season that the triple world champion has been beaten.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Lando Norris was fourth and George Russell fifth for Mercedes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with a bonus point for fastest lap, and Yuki Tsunoda eighth for Red Bull-owned RB.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Albon scored Williams's first points of the season in ninth and Pierre Gasly took the final one for Alpine despite a first-lap collision with team mate Esteban Ocon, whose race ended immediately. (Reuters)

    Major cyclone hits Bangaldesh as almost a million flee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People gather their belongings to head inland in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754785_1_20240526235020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An intense cyclone smashed into the low-lying coast of Bangladesh on Sunday, with nearly a million people fleeing inland for concrete storm shelters away from howling gales and crashing waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The severe Cyclone Remal has started crossing the Bangladesh coast," Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Azizur Rahman said, adding the raging storm could continue hammering the coast until at least the early hours of Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have so far recorded maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometres per hour, but the wind speed may pick up more pace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters predicted gusts of up to 130 kilometres per hour, with heavy rain and winds also lashing neighbouring India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its densely populated coast has increased sharply, from one a year to as many as three, due to the impact of climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to four metres above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous," Bangladeshi senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are terrified," said 35-year-old fisherman Yusuf Fakir at Kuakata, a town on the very southern tip of Bangladesh in the predicted route of the storm, speaking just before its arrival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 800,000 Bangladeshis fled their coastal villages, while more than 50,000 people in India also moved inland from the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea, government ministers and disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to ensure that a single life is not lost," said Bankim Chandra Hazra, a senior minister in India's West Bengal state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Kolkata airport closed on Sunday, while the Indian navy readied two ships with aid and medical supplies for "immediate deployment". (AFP)

    30 killed in strike on Rafah; Hamas targets Tel Aviv

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli air strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded dozens in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah designated for the displaced, Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike took place in Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah, where thousands of people were taking shelter after many fled the eastern areas of the city where Israeli forces began a ground offensive over two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Palestinian health official said dozens of Palestinians were killed and wounded while Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, put the number of deaths at 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah was receiving an influx of casualties, and that other hospitals also were taking in a large number of patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Israel. The final death toll was unclear as many wounded were in critical condition, medics said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the attack in Rafah as a "massacre", holding the United States responsible for aiding Israel with weapons and money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The air strikes burnt the tents, the tents are melting and the people's bodies are also melting," said one of the residents who arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said eight projectiles were identified crossing from the area of Rafah, the southern tip of the Gaza Strip where Israel kept up operations despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop attacking the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of the projectiles were intercepted, it said. There were no reports of casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his war cabinet later on Sunday to discuss continued operations in Rafah. Israel argues that the UN court's ruling allows room for some military action there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Hamas al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets were launched in response to "Zionist massacres against civilians". (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 670 people are assumed to have died in Papua New Guinea's massive landslide, the UN migration agency estimated on Sunday as rescue efforts continued.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media in the nation had previously estimated Friday's landslide had buried more than 300 people. But more than 48 hours later the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said the death toll may be more than double that, as the full extent of the destruction is still unclear and continuing dangerous conditions on the ground are hampering aid and rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five bodies had been retrieved from the rubble so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency based its death toll estimates on information provided by officials at Yambali Village in the Enga province, who say more than 150 houses were buried in Friday's landslide, Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the agency's mission in Papua New Guinea said in an email statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Land is still sliding, rocks are falling, ground soil is cracking due to constant increased pressure and ground water is running thus the area is posing an extreme risk for everyone," Aktoprak said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 250 houses nearby have been abandoned by the inhabitants, who had taken temporary shelter with their relatives and friends, and some 1,250 people have been displaced, the agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are using digging sticks, spades, large agricultural forks to remove the bodies buried under the soil," Aktoprak said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IOM said an elementary school, small businesses and stalls, a guesthouse, and a petrol station were also buried.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN's Papua New Guinea office said five bodies were retrieved from an area where 50 to 60 homes had been destroyed, and a number of injured reported, including at least 20 women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOM said the community in this village was relatively young and it's feared that the most fatalities would be children of 15 years or younger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The geographic remoteness and the tough, hilly terrain is slowing rescue and aid efforts. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of six NGOs supporting street sleepers on Sunday called on Hongkongers to show more compassion for the homeless.
 <br>
  <br>
   The Homeless Alliance said there is less negativity shown towards street sleepers nowadays, but there is still room for the public to better understand their plight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The alliance held a fair on Sunday and invited people to sit in a demonstration set-up of cardboards and umbrellas to experience homelessness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were also sharing sessions where current and former street sleepers shared their life stories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former homeless person, Siu-hing, said she was happy to tell people about herself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope people will not look at homeless people with prejudice," she told RTHK. "I've had it rough."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chi-keung, who said he was a big spender before becoming homeless, said he hopes people can learn from his experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "People who become homeless all have their stories, I'm sharing mine so people will be alert," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Isaac Ho, who works for ImpactHK – one of the six NGOs in the alliance – said fair participants can also learn how to communicate with the underprivileged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Don't miss the self-introduction when you approach them, let them know you're here as a human being to care for another human being," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He urged the government to devise policies to support those who’re homeless, including having a longer notice period before cleaning the streets, and arranging housing for them in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we want to tackle [homelessness], we give them a home to live first. And then medical, social counseling, employment services can also be delivered to them. Sleeping in a more stable and safe environment is the foundation of change."

    'Fire safety inspections beefed up after Jordan blaze'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Andy Yeung says the Fire Services Department has improved its inspection mechanism after the Jordan fire. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754751_2_20240526160543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said officials have stepped up inspections of old buildings following a deadly blaze at a residential building in Jordan last month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On April 10, a No.3 alarm fire which broke out in New Lucky House killed five people and injured around 40 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Yeung said preliminary investigation showed that some of the fire doors were open, which might have led to heavy smoke in one of the staircases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the Fire Services Department has since improved its inspection mechanism, with priority being given to old buildings and those for commercial use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We use a risk-based inspection mechanism which decides how often a building should be checked each year based on how risky it is,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the fire in New Lucky House, we adjusted the mechanism to prioritise inspections of old buildings and commercial premises, hoping to eliminate fire hazards as soon as possible.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said 2,000 inspections had been carried out and around 600 fire hazard abatement notices had been issued in the past month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire services director also noted that an amendment bill will be tabled to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say the government will shelve its plan to introduce a citywide waste charging scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The arrangement was originally scheduled to come into effect from August 1, but sources say the government will inform the Legislative Council on Monday of its plan to put it on the back-burner indefinitely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who's also chairman of Legco's Panel on Environmental Affairs, welcomed the news, saying this is not the right time to introduce the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials should consider a number of factors, such as the state of the city's economy and the availability of recycling services, before deciding when to bring back the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau added that he believes the government will continue to step up education and promotional efforts on waste reduction to boost the community’s understanding of the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said he would be "very disappointed" if the scheme is to be shelved indefinitely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong is facing a very serious waste crisis, and called on lawmakers not to overexaggerate the scheme's impact on the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please do not blow up part of the community's negative response or comment. The effects of the financial burden mentioned by some of the political parties only affect some of the sectors of the community," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has already delayed the waste charging scheme twice in the past... the authorities should treat this law seriously and give the public the timeline for rolling out the scheme."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a trilateral summit with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. It's their first three-way talks in more than four years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries agreed to hold a summit every year starting in 2008 to boost regional cooperation, but the initiative has been disrupted by tensions and the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their last trilateral summit was in late 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in Seoul said South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Li will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the ageing population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with Li and Kishida ahead of their three-way gathering on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida is also expected to meet separately with Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials and diplomats in Seoul warned not to expect breakthroughs on sensitive issues but said the summit could make progress in areas of practical cooperation like people-to-people exchanges and consular matters. (Reuters)

    Trump vows to free 'dark web' drug kingpin

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of US presidential candidate Donald Trump spar with opponents during the Libertarian Party's national convention in Washington. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754743_1_20240526140121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump appealed for support from the fringe Libertarian Party on Saturday, telling a rowdy crowd that if elected he would free from prison an American man who ran a website that sold millions of dollars in drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came at a contentious speech -- where the crowd often jeered and booed the ex-president -- at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, as he seeks support in the November US election against incumbent Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you vote for me, on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht," Trump said, in a line that brought the rowdy crowd over to his side as cheers erupted from the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also vowed to put a libertarian in his cabinet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2015, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of masterminding the Silk Road "dark web" marketplace, which sold US$200 million in drugs to customers across the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ulbricht, who ran Silk Road under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" and was also accused of commissioning five murders at a cost of US$650,000, was sentenced to two life sentences for narcotics distribution and criminal enterprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His case has become a famous cause in libertarian circles, who have decried the conviction as government overreach and against the principles of free markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has previously vowed to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the promise to free Ulbricht brought cheers, Trump's speech was far from the usual lovefest he presides over at his rallies, which typically attract hardcore supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conservative was variously booed as he tried to make common cause with the libertarians in the audience, many of whom view his policies as outside their extremely limited scope of what the government should be able to do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Libertarian Party should nominate Trump for president of the United States," he said to a mix of cheers and boos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only if you want to win. Maybe you don't want to win," Trump said as he at times sparred with the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The speech came after Trump rolled the dice on Thursday by making a campaign stop in deeply Democratic New York, seeking to woo Black and Latino voters whose support for Biden has shown signs of faltering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to compete for untraditional votes, you have to take risks," Trump advisor Jason Miller told news outlet Semafor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Libertarian Party routinely runs minor candidates that promote both popular limited-government ideas like marijuana legalization while simultaneously pushing fringe ideas like abolishing the federal tax collection agency or social security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its candidates have never posed serious threats in presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If they weren't interested in mixing it up by endorsing Trump, they were free to "keep getting your three percent every four years," he said. (AFP)

    Golf world rocked by death of Grayson Murray

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfer Grayson Murray, who won his second PGA Tour title at the Sony Open in January, died on Saturday at the age of 30, the tour said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murray had withdrawn from the Charles Schwab Challenge with an unspecified illness during Friday's second round in Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were devastated to learn - and are heartbroken to share - that PGA Tour player Grayson Murray passed away this morning. I am at a loss for words," PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The PGA Tour is a family, and when you lose a member of your family, you are never the same. We mourn Grayson and pray for comfort for his loved ones."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monahan said he had spoken with Murray's parents to offer condolences and they had "asked that we continue with tournament play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were adamant that Grayson would want us to do so. As difficult as it will be, we want to respect their wishes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour did not specify a cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray's second career title in Hawaii in January was an emotional affair, capping a stunning personal comeback from alcohol abuse and mental health issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray, who had claimed his only prior tour title as a rookie at the 2017 Barbasol Championship, had also been slowed by a motor scooter accident in Bermuda in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After rolling in a 38-foot birdie putt to win a three-man playoff, Murray said he hoped his return to the winner's circle could provide inspiration for others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I can help one person that's all it takes," he said in Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not easy," Murray mused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wanted to give up a lot of times -- give up on myself, give up on the game of golf, give up on life at times," he said, adding that he hoped his legacy going forward would be to be "known as a good person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray had been tabbed for stardom from a young age.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was just 16 when he made his first cut on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour and won three straight Junior World Championships from 2006-08.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A solid season on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2023 saw him return to the PGA Tour, and his Sony Open victory saw him reach a career high 46th in the world rankings. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico City, which is in the midst of a heatwave, recorded its highest-ever temperature on Saturday as thermostats hit 34.7 degrees Celsius, according to the National Meteorological Service (SMN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The record high was recorded on Saturday afternoon at the Tacubaya observatory, the SMN said, after thermometers in the capital reached an earlier record of 34.3 degrees Celsius on May 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico warned on Wednesday that in the next two weeks intensifying heat could bring new record temperatures to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country has recorded 48 deaths due to intense heatwaves hitting the country since March, the government said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eastern coastal state of Veracruz recorded the highest number of deaths, with 14, followed by Tabasco, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas with eight each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Mexico reported a record 419 heat-related deaths in the hot season, which runs from March to October, in a country of 129 million people. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of a community project to support carers on Sunday said nine carer spaces will be set up across the city to identify caregivers and address their plight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Patrick Nip, convenor of the Advisory Committee of the Jockey Club Carer Space Project, said Hong Kong’s ageing population is a growing cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nip noted that some 240,000 people are providing long-term care for around 300,000 elderly citizens in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Nip said it's important to remind carers to take care of their own mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How can we strengthen support for carers and remind them that they have their own needs too? Some don't see themselves as carers because they think it's their duty. Others might not be aware of their own mental state - even when they're on the verge of collapse. So I think an assessment is needed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carer spaces, located in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Ma On Shan, Kwai Fong, Tsing Yi, Tai Wai, Shek Kip Mei, Sai Wan Ho and Sham Shui Po, will provide counselling and assessment services for carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daytime respite services for the elderly will also be available at a cost of HK$30 for four hours, with exemptions for those facing financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nip, a former government official, said the five-year project is expected to benefit around 27,000 carers and 15,000 care recipients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the ultimate goal is to create a viable model for the administration to consider going forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most importantly, we hope to innovate boldly and try to find a feasible model in this pilot project. It can be replicated on a large scale, so the government can take over and it can be sustained. This is our goal," he explained.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said talks he held during his trip to Paris showed that these visits were conducive to helping others better understand the SAR's development, and clearing up misunderstandings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, the minister said he had been promoting the SAR's advantages to political and business leaders in France, and they were highly interested in the city’s latest developments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some meeting participants told us that it was very important for the SAR government to actively go out and contact friends from different sectors," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief said people he met during his French visit agreed that the SAR remains highly promising, with some describing the city as being as vibrant and charismatic as it was before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that he had been fostering exchanges between the two places in the business and cultural arenas, noting that he invited the organiser of a French tech conference, VivaTech, as well as the Théâtre National de Chaillot, to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said he will be leaving for San Francisco on Monday to promote cooperation between China and the United States in dealing with climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the current geopolitical situation is complicated, addressing climate change is the responsibility of the whole world. Countries must establish a stronger foundation for cooperation and smoother communication channels, so that the world can have a greater chance of success in moving towards zero carbon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said Hong Kong is sparing no efforts in becoming an international hub of green technology and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that he and other representatives will be sharing the SAR's knowledge and experience in developing a sustainable future in the Bay to Bay Dialogue and the US-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action.

 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung has congratulated Hong Kong rowing athlete Chiu Hin-chun on winning a gold medal in Lightweight Men's Single Sculls in the 2024 World Rowing Cup II Lucerne, Switzerland.
