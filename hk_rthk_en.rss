<div class="itemFullText">
 Jessica Pegula became the highest-ranked player to be dumped out of Wimbledon so far on Thursday, losing 6-4, 6-7 (7/9), 6-1 to China's Wang Xinyu in the second round.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American, ranked fifth in the world, battled back after losing the first set, saving a match point in the second-set tie-break, before levelling the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But China's 42nd-ranked Wang raced into a 5-0 lead in the decider before wrapping up the contest to record her first win against a top-10 player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, said: "Couple of days ago I was asking my coach, 'When will this happen?'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Jessica was really tough to play on grass. Her ball was super low and I'm just really happy I won in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang will face Britain's Harriet Dart, who defeated Nottingham champion Katie Boulter, for a spot in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova earlier this week became the first defending women's champion to lose in the first round for 30 years. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The dean of the University of Hong Kong's business school, Cai Hongbin, said at least 30 people had cheated their way into the school through the use of false documents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school revealed in May that it was investigating “a small number of people" who had secured admissions with fake degrees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with mainland media outlet Caixin on Thursday, Cai said the investigation has so far uncovered more than 30 people who got into the school fraudulently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He believes the number could reach 80 to 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cai said agencies that claimed to offer "guaranteed admission" had forged transcripts and diplomas from overseas universities, and that some students might have been kept in the dark about what had happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, police said they have arrested two women linked to the scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the suspects, 24, was charged with the use of a false instrument, while the case of another suspect, 34, was still under investigation. Both are mainland residents and two-way permit holders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday called on the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to ensure security in the face of real threat from the Cold War mentality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks when attending the SCO summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the member states to adhere to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, address complex and intertwined security challenges through dialogue and coordination, and respond to the profoundly changing international landscape with a win-win approach, so as to build a world of lasting peace and universal security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the world is faced with accelerating changes unseen in a century, the human society is standing at a crossroads of history again, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president pointed out that the SCO stands on the right side of history, fairness and justice, and is of great significance to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SCO members should consolidate unity and jointly oppose external interference in the face of the real challenges of interference and division, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasised the group's focus on ensuring security of its members, and said the SCO will form a dedicated centre that will coordinate response to various security challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the group's members will also endorse a special program to fight separatism and extremism. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Finnish conductor Tarmo Peltokoski has been named the new music director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil), succeeding Dutch maestro Jaap van Zweden from the 2026-27 season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old is the youngest director in the philharmonic's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his debut with the orchestra at a concert in June last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK Radio 4, Peltokoski compared the experience of leading the HK Phil to driving a luxury car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's absolutely world class. So it's a luxury car, so to say. I actually don't drive actual cars, but now I can drive the HK Phil. I was super impressed. We had our first rehearsal, and I'm excited for the years to come," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The award-wining composer studied piano at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, and is also interested in music comedy and improvisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2022, he was awarded “Principal Guest Conductor” of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen in Germany, the first conductor to hold the position in the orchestra’s 42-year history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Cogman, chairman of HK Phil's board of governors, said he is delighted to welcome the Finnish musician on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a remarkable and visionary musician, and we are very fortunate that he will write the next chapter in our orchestra’s history," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive of HK Phil, Benedikt Fohr, said the appointment of Peltokoski marked a significant milestone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a highly talented musician from the younger generation. Under his leadership, we wish to inspire a new generation of music lovers, and continue to enhance our artistic excellence and elevate our reputation in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested two women for allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O for crypto ransom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They received a report from a woman that her son was taken from a mall on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy was rescued by officers in the flat of one of the suspects on Thursday morning. He had no apparent injury and was sent to hospital for observation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the two suspects had financial difficulties. They also said there's no evidence they knew the boy's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that one of the suspects took the victim by force and moved him to a quieter place nearby, like a park, in a stroller. Another suspect put the kid in a suitcase and then moved him to the flat," said chief superintendent Kwan King-pan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said one of the suspects is an HKID holder and the other holds a two-way permit. Both are 38 and unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects asked the boy's family to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency possibly because it's harder to trace, but no ransom was paid.

    Govt to tender one residential site this quarter

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced that it will put only one residential site up for tender this quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A plot at Shiu Lek Yuen in Sha Tin is expected to generate 570 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the authorities will not be selling any commercial sites this quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also a hard fact that the vacancy rate for the commercial floor area in the economy is now on the high side. According to some recent statistics, it is around 13 percent. So, taking into account the market condition, we think we have a reason not to roll out commercial sites in this quarter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government's land sales, private property developments and urban renewal projects in the first two quarters will provide a total of 4,065 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will meet around one-third of the target of 13,200 units for this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to sell a total of eight residential sites this financial year, including six unsold sites from the previous land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Lands Department, only one piece of land was sold between April and June. The plot, which went for almost HK$82 million, will be used for a charging station for electric vehicles.

    Ladies only: KMB route driven solely by female drivers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In a first for Hong Kong, KMB has earmarked a bus route which will be served exclusively by female drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The franchised bus operator is also adding more female-friendly staff facilities in the hope of attracting more women to join its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting this month, KMB's route 69 between Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long will be handled by 11 female bus captains. A second such route is also on the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new resting room installed at the Tin Shui Wai terminus was also designed with female users in mind. It includes a changing room and a full-length mirror.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas Mak, head of operations at the company's Tuen Mun depot, said the bus operator is keen to smash a common stereotype that female drivers are not as good on the roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that women currently make up eight percent of KMB's 10,000 drivers. The company's goal is to increase this to 10 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taiwan-based airline STARLUX on Thursday said it aims to operate up to five daily round trips between the island and Hong Kong in the future.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its first flights between Hong Kong and Taipei will take off on July 16, with two round trips each day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tony Cho, the airline's mainland China chief representative and Hong Kong branch general manager, said the coming year is the right time to boost passenger flight frequency, when Chek Lap Kok's third runway comes into full operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is capable of increasing its manpower from the current 18 members of staff stationed in Hong Kong, Cho added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to compete with each other among this industry, but we also cooperate with them," he said. "We need more frequency to serve Taiwan and Hong Kong, and other areas for our business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In celebration of the new flights, a STARLUX-themed tram will run until the end of September, and there will be a sightseeing journey across Hong Kong Island later in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Tramways, which has partnered with the airline, said the collaboration will attract more tourists from Taiwan to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nixon Cheung, the tram operator's head of commercial and brand, said the public transport firm has seen a surge in passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have a great rebound during the past years, especially when we have many free ride days, that catered to a lot of customers, especially tourists flying from all over the world," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ocean Park Conservation Foundation on Thursday said it had retrieved the carcasses of two dolphins from Pui O Beach on Lantau, to try to find out why they died.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The foundation said one of the dolphins was a newborn, while the other was a severely decomposed adult of 2.4 metres in length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation urged people to report any stranded dolphins or whales to the 1823 government hotline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also called on people not to use shampoos or body washes while on boats, to prevent ocean pollution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s Assistant Scientific Manager, Dr Edgar Leung, estimated that the two Chinese white dolphins died over a week ago. He added that based on past experience, it will be almost impossible to find out the cause of their deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since 2006… we have investigated over 600 cetacean stranding cases altogether. However, most of the carcasses were found severely decomposed, like these two cases. Therefore, the cause of death is hard to determine. Only 10 percent of them can be addressed,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said possible causes of death include entanglement in fish nets or a bacterial infection. He said a necropsy will be carried out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Dolphin Conservation Society, Taison Chang, also said it will be very difficult to determine the cause of the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because mainly of the condition of the decomposed body. Most of the time, dead bodies recovered are very decomposed. So even if there is like a cut by a fishing line or a cut by propellers of a boat, the decomposed part, the body tissue, can easily mask the injury," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said more measures are on the way to make life easier for non-Chinese people in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came days after Beijing's move to allow non-Chinese permanent residents of the SAR to apply for a five-year mainland travel permit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the China Conference, hosted by the South China Morning Post, Lee hailed the new arrangement as a groundbreaking policy development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is actually a big policy breakthrough. The first step I have done to create convenience for non-Chinese friends in Hong Kong is that for any staff of a company set up in Hong Kong, there has been a fast-track procedure for them to apply for a visa to visit mainland China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So that is step one, and now we have step two, and there will be more steps coming. I hope I will deliver more to you in due course."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the measures underline Hong Kong's unique advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle, attracting companies and professionals to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong will continue to strengthen its competitiveness and role as a gateway between the mainland and global markets.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a force for global stability at a summit of the regional body in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their second meeting in as many months, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should "uphold the original aspiration of friendship for generations" in response to an "ever-changing international situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling Putin an "old friend", Xi alluded to the progress the two countries had made in putting in place "plans and arrangements for the next development of bilateral relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said the two sides should continuously conserve the unique value in China-Russia relations, and explore the internal driving force of bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Putin said the SCO has “firmly established itself as one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order", adding that bilateral ties between Moscow and Beijing were at their best in history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our cooperation is not aimed against anyone, we are not creating any blocs or alliances, we are just acting in the interests of our peoples," Putin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's spokesman later told state TV that the two leaders discussed Ukraine and agreed that peace talks without Russia's presence were futile. (Agencies)

    Alcaraz, Sinner through to Wimbledon's third round

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Title rivals Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz reached the Wimbledon third round on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sinner defeated Italian Davis Cup teammate Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a three-hour 42-minute duel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berrettini, the 2021 runner-up, fired 65 winners, including 28 aces, past the top seed and carved out four breaks of serve to two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Sinner calmly recovered from a break down in the fourth set before playing the more composed tiebreak, which ended when Berrettini committed his 48th and final unforced error of the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very tough we had to face each other in the second round," said 2023 semi-finalist Sinner, who will take on Miomir Kecmanovic for a place in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz defeated Australia's world number 69 Aleksandar Vukic 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 6-2 on the back of 42 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Spaniard's only moments of concern came in the first set when he let slip a 5-2 lead and found himself 5-6 down with Vukic serving for the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the three-time major winner steadied the ship to race away to victory against a player who got the better of him in qualifying at the 2020 French Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz next faces fellow crowd-pleaser Frances Tiafoe, the American he defeated in five sets in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open on his way to his first Grand Slam triumph. (AFP)

    'Japan's forced sterilisation law unconstitutional'

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the law that aimed to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760168_1_20240704055209.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's top court ruled on Wednesday that a defunct eugenics law under which thousands of people were forcibly sterilised between 1948 and 1996 was unconstitutional.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court also declared that a 20-year statute of limitations could not be applied, paving the way for compensation claims from victims after years of legal battles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the state to evade responsibility for damages payments would be extremely unfair and unjust, and absolutely intolerable," the court in Tokyo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's government acknowledges that around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the law that aimed to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An additional 8,500 people were sterilised with their consent, although lawyers say even those cases were likely "de facto forced" because of the pressure individuals faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 1953 government notice said physical restraint, anaesthesia and even "deception" could be used for the operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who couldn't be here today. There are those who died as well. I want to visit the grave of my parents and tell them we've won," victim Saburo Kita, who uses a pseudonym, told reporters after the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kita was convinced to undergo a vasectomy when he was 14 at a facility housing troubled children. He only told his wife what had happened shortly before she died in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But a complete resolution of this issue hasn't been realised yet. Together with lawyers, I will continue to fight," said Kita, one of several victims who celebrated outside the court, some in wheelchairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of operations in Japan slowed to a trickle in the 1980s and 1990s before the law was scrapped in 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That dark history was thrust back under the spotlight in 2018 when a woman in her 60s sued the government over a procedure she had undergone at age 15, opening the floodgates for similar lawsuits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government, for its part, "wholeheartedly" apologised after legislation was passed in 2019 stipulating a lump-sum payment of 3.2 million yen (around US$20,000 today) per victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, survivors say that was too little to match the severity of their suffering and took their fight to court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional courts have mostly agreed in recent years that the eugenics law was a violation of Japan's constitution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, judges have been divided on whether claims are valid beyond the 20-year statute of limitations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some ordered the state to pay damages but others dismissed cases, saying the window for pursuing damages had closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the government would "swiftly pay damages based on the finalised ruling" and discuss "the new ways in which (victims) can be compensated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government "sincerely apologises" for the policy that "trampled on the human dignity" of victims, Kishida said, adding he would meet survivors in coming weeks to listen "face-to-face to their stories of suffering."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A group of victims said on Wednesday it "wholeheartedly" welcomed the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot forgive the irresponsibility of the government and its lack of human rights awareness, as well as the fact that what is now described as the biggest human rights violation in Japan's post-war history was left unaddressed for such a long time," the group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Koji Niizato said it was "the best ruling we could have hoped for."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victims of the eugenics law put up a wonderful fight, one that influenced the Supreme Court and changed society," Niizato said. (AFP)

    Joe Biden 'absolutely not' withdrawing from race

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden says he almost nodded off during the disastrous debate. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760164_1_20240704035222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden is "absolutely not" pulling out of the White House race, his spokeswoman said on Wednesday, as pressure mounted on the veteran Democrat following his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old Biden has told a key ally he must convince the public quickly that he can do the job, The New York Times and CNN reported, raising the stakes for Biden's first post-debate TV interview, scheduled for Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He knows if he has two more events like that, we're in a different place," the ally said, discussing the president's poor showing against his Republican predecessor last week, according to the Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House quickly rejected the reporting as false.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Democratic establishment figures have voiced bafflement over what they see as deflection and excuses from the president and his aides after his often incoherent debate performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Congress, lawmakers see Democratic prospects of taking over the House of Representatives, hanging on to the Senate and returning to the White House slipping away, four months ahead of the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The concern was compounded by a new New York Times poll conducted after the debate that showed Trump with his biggest lead ever over Biden – 49 percent to 43 percent of likely voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other post-debate polling by progressive non-profit OpenLabs found that New Hampshire, Virginia and New Mexico – all once safe Biden states – are now in play for Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn't until Tuesday – five days after the debate – that Biden called House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and congressional staffers have been voicing consternation over the glacial pace of the outreach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are getting to the point where it may not have been the debate that did him in, but the aftermath of how they've handled it," a senior Democratic operative told Washington political outlet Axios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is "absolutely not" withdrawing from the race, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday, adding he is "moving forward" with his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aware of growing alarm in the party, Biden scheduled a meeting with all 23 Democratic governors on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will make his pitch in the swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days, and sit with ABC News on Friday for his first interview since the debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president has cited fatigue as a new explanation for his poor showing, saying that he had been unwise to travel "around the world a couple times" before the debate and "almost fell asleep on stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he had been back in the United States for nearly two weeks and spent two days relaxing and six in debate preparation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said people who have interacted with the president had found that his mental fogginess was "growing more frequent, more pronounced and more worrisome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic lawmakers have begun to go public with their doubts, with two saying on Tuesday they expected Biden to lose to Trump in November and another calling for him to quit the White House race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Big names in the House of Representatives who are usually foursquare behind Biden – including Nancy Pelosi and James Clyburn – have acknowledged that questions over his condition are fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Democrats vented their frustration during a video call on Tuesday, although some reportedly cautioned against changing leaders so close to the August nominating convention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fundamental issue, of course, isn't the campaign. It's not the Biden family. And it's not even last week's debate," political analyst and prominent Trump critic Bill Kristol wrote on Wednesday for conservative outlet The Bulwark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the fitness of the president to be president – not for a few more months, but for four more years." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A long home straight helped them form a lead out train the 'Manx Missile' mastered as he powered across the finish line well ahead of Belgian Jasper Philipsen, last year's sprint points green jersey winner.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In 2023 Cavendish left the Tour in an ambulance after a banal crash bamboozled his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two seasons previously when Cavendish equalled all-time great Eddy Merckx's stage haul in Carcassonne, it was his fourth win on that edition racing for Quick Step after years in the wilderness suffering from Epstein Barr virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's my 15th Tour de France and it takes a lot to get here, getting in shape every year," Cavendish said at the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm surrounded by incredible people and I owe a lot to them" added Cavendish who made his Tour debut in 2008 before becoming world road race champion three years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He missed out on a 35th stage on the Champs Elysees coming second and then missed the cut for the 2022 Tour as Quick Step picked Fabio Jakobsen 10 years his junior.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cavendish joined Astana in 2023 before being persuaded to sign a one-year contract extension for this season.
  <br/>

  Race leader and two-time former winner Tadej Pogacar almost hit a traffic island causing a wave of movement and a pile up of bikes and bodies behind him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Slovenian preferred to focus on Cavendish after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I used to watch him on television and we loved him," Pogacar said. "Just back there I saw him and he said hey, don't you go breaking my record," he jokingly added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq again finished at fresh records on Wednesday, extending a positive run following mixed economic data in a quiet holiday-shortened session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US private-sector hiring came in a bit below expectations for June, while a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a surprise contraction in services industry activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are looking ahead to Friday's jobs report, said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, adding that the labour market seems to be "normalising but not collapsing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan described trading volumes as extremely low ahead of the July 4th holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,537, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.9 percent to 18,188.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones meanwhile lost 0.1 percent at 39,308.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Southwest Airlines advanced 1.6 percent after announcing a shareholder rights plan designed to prevent Elliott Investment Management from gaining a controlling stake in the carrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramount Global jumped 6.9 percent following reports that it reached a deal to be bought by movie studio Skydance after earlier breaking off the talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Constellation Brands dropped 3.8 percent after reporting a 22 percent jump in quarterly profits to US$877 million behind strong beer sales. However, net sales in wine and spirits fell. (AFP)

    World's oldest artwork discovered in Indonesian cave

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The painting, which is in poor condition, shows three people around a wild pig. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760146_1_20240703233054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It may not look like much – just a flaking image of three people around a big red pig.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the humble cave painting discovered in Indonesia is the oldest known narrative artwork ever made by human hands, dating back more than 51,000 years, new research said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the oldest evidence of storytelling," said Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist at Australia's Griffith University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aubert was part of the team that identified the previous record holder in 2019, a hunting scene found in a nearby Indonesian cave then estimated to be nearly 44,000 years old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest discovery, which was dated using a new laser technique, marks "the first time we've passed the 50,000-year barrier," said Aubert, a co-author of a new study in Nature describing the find.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That early humans were able to tell such a "sophisticated" story through art could rewrite our understanding of human cognitive evolution, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our discovery suggests that storytelling was a much older part of human history... than previously thought," study co-author archaeologist Adam Brumm told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the discovery, the researchers used a new method that uses lasers and computer software to create a "map" of rock samples.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This laser ablation technique is more precise, easier, quicker, cheaper, and requires much smaller rock samples than the previous uranium series method, Aubert said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team first tested the new technique on the previous record holder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It determined that the hunting scene was actually at least 48,000 years old – 4,000 years older than the uranium series method determined in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team then tried the laser method out on a previously undated painting first spotted in a cave on Indonesia's Sulawesi island in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was found to to be least 51,200 years old, smashing the previous record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The painting, which is in poor condition, shows three people around a wild pig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't know exactly what they're doing," Aubert admitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He speculated that the paintings were likely made by the first group of humans who moved through Southeast Asia before arriving in Australia around 65,000 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's probably just a matter of time before we find samples that are older," Aubert added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Humans first evolved in Africa more than 300,000 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first images known to have been made by humans are simple lines and patterns made in ochre found in South Africa dating back 100,000 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But then there is a "huge gap" in human art until the Indonesian cave paintings 50,000 years later, Aubert said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The question is, why is it not everywhere?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One theory is that artwork elsewhere did not survive all those millennia. Another is that ancient art could still be out there waiting to be discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously the first narrative art was thought to have emerged in Europe. A "lion man" statue found in Germany has been dated to around 40,000 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The date given for the Indonesian cave art is "quite provocative" because it is so much older than what has been found elsewhere, including in Europe, said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at London's Natural History Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stringer, who was not involved in the research, said the experienced team's findings looked sound but needed to be confirmed by further dating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In my view this find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge..." (AFP)

    Murray to partner Raducanu in Wimbledon mixed doubles

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray is teaming up with Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon in an eye-catching all-British mixed doubles pairing as part of his farewell to the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair were on Wednesday granted a wild card just a day after Murray, 37, pulled out of the singles due to his failure to regain full fitness following a back operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon singles champion will also play men's doubles with his brother Jamie at the All England Club, with the pair launching their campaign on Centre Court on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mixed doubles event starts the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray played mixed doubles with Serena Williams in 2019, making it to the third round, but it will be a Grand Slam debut in doubles for Raducanu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old floated the idea of teaming up with Murray two years ago, telling the BBC: "We haven't actually spoken about it but it's something we feel we both want to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked following her first-round singles win on Monday about Murray's influence on her, Raducanu, US Open champion in 2021, said: "I think the biggest advice is just how he's always taken care of his operations, how he manages his people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really spoken to him so much. I think for me it's just watching him operate day to day, watching him be absolutely on it with everything. Even in practice now he's so on it to the minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray and Raducanu face a tough opening round contest against Marcelo Arevalo and Zhang Shuai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arevalo last month won the men's doubles title for the second time at the French Open while Zhang is also a two-time Grand Slam doubles champion. (AFP)

    Hurricane Beryl bears down on Jamaica

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beryl barrels towards Jamaica, with forecasters warning of potentially deadly winds and storm surge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760142_1_20240703224118.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Powerful Hurricane Beryl churned towards Jamaica on Wednesday with dangerous winds and sea surge, as residents hunkered down against a storm that has killed seven people and caused destruction in the Caribbean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hurricane – unusually strong so early in the Atlantic season – was expected to pass near or over Jamaica by midday as a life-threatening Category 4 storm, meteorologists said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl is the first storm since US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Across Jamaica, people removed boats from the water and tied them to fences for safety and rushed to buy food, water, petrol and other essentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of Wednesday morning the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 235 kilometres per hour, said the NHC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared an island-wide 6 am to 6 pm curfew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Desmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has tried to be ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're doing the usual, removing all objects that can cause damage," he told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment – including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do," Brown said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain from the outer bands of Beryl started pounding Jamaica overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurricane warnings were also issued in the Cayman Islands further west, which Beryl was expected to pass near or over on Wednesday night or early on Thursday, according to the NHC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall on Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela. (AFP)

    Legco passes bill to reform social worker board

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco has passed a bill that the government says will get the Social Workers Registration Board back on the right track. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760115_1_20240703173836.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill to reform the Social Workers Registration Board, increasing the number of government-appointed members.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The board will be expanded from 15 to 27 members, with the number of appointees rising from eight to 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All members will be required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new law also stipulates that social workers who are convicted of a national security offence will be permanently stripped of their licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All lawmakers who spoke on the bill supported it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said reforming the composition of the board will ensure that different voices within the sector are properly represented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the changes have righted some wrongs, and the bill's passage shows Legco wants the sector to start afresh and return to providing professional services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Welfare Secretary Chris Sun thanked lawmakers for supporting the bill, saying the legal changes will allow the board to get back on the right track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe with the strengthened composition of the board, it will encourage more young people to study social work and be a social worker. With a broadened board, it will provide better protection and certainty to the profession," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe [the new board] will strengthen the professional development of the whole profession as well as strengthen its role to ensure national [security]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past three weeks, all but one of the existing elected board members resigned, including former chairman Ng Yut-ming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said there is no need to hold by-elections for their seats, because they left with less than a year of their terms remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new law will be gazetted on Friday, when an oath-taking ceremony will take place and the list of appointed members will be announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that he hopes the new board can quickly review the members of its disciplinary committee panel, as well as the social worker code of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said it should set up a mechanism to ensure the prompt handling of social worker registration for those who have committed serious crimes such as national security offences, as well as a framework for the continuous development of the profession.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday during his visit to Kazakhstan that the two sides have set a new goal of doubling two-way trade at an early date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China and Kazakhstan agreed to continuously deepen cooperation in such traditional areas as economy, trade, investment, production capacity, interconnectivity and energy, Xi said when jointly meeting the press with his Kazakh counterpart, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in the capital Astana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries will also jointly foster new growth points for cooperation in critical minerals, new energy, scientific and technological innovation, aerospace, digital economy and other fields, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi said China supports Kazakhstan in joining the BRICS group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also said China and Kazakhstan have agreed to jointly implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, three key initiatives proposed by Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Chinese side will hold China tourism year in Kazakhstan in 2025, and that the two countries will expand cooperation in areas such as media, think tanks, as well as film and television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi described his talks with Tokayev as "amicable, friendly and fruitful".
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers say they have charged a 27-year-old man with trafficking dangerous drugs after a tip-off from their Australian counterparts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Between them, authorities in the two places seized 13.5 kilogrammes of methamphetamine and six kilogrammes of cocaine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drugs, with a combined street value of HK$12 million, were being sent from the SAR to Australia inside stone statues, SAR officials said.

  Police in Perth arrested a 17-year-old boy, while the Hong Kong arrest was made in Tsim Sha Tsui on June 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Earlier in June, the Australian enforcers have notified us that they intercepted an air cargo shipment from Hong Kong to Australia. The shipment was declared as a collection of stone statues. The statues were found to conceal around six kilogrammes of suspected cocaine. Customs subsequently took over the investigation,” said investigator Chris Kwan from the department's drug investigation bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We swiftly identified three more shipments that were about to be sent from Hong Kong to Australia. They were also declared as stone statues or Feng Shui decorations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said officers discovered a unit in a Tsim Sha Tsui commercial building where drugs were being concealed in statues and decorations before being smuggled to other locations.

    PolyU plans to apply for Chang'e-6 soil samples

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University on Wednesday said it is planning to apply for lunar samples from the Chang’e-6 space mission.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The spacecraft returned on June 25, bringing back the first samples ever collected from the lunar face that can’t be seen from Earth. PolyU developed a device to collect the samples.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university previously acquired lunar soil samples collected in the Chang’e-5 mission from the China National Space Administration, including a 400 mg surface sample and a 42.6 mg deep drill sample.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Yung Kai-leung, who heads the university’s Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations, said such samples are hard to come by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The lunar regolith is very very precious. Even if you are able to get 400 milligrammes, even for one crystal or one particle of the lunar regolith, we will be able to actually tell a lot of stories from there,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung said the team is eager to compare soil samples from both sides of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That actually has a lot of significance. Because we can see the front side, meaning that side is actually protected by Earth, especially from the magnetic field and the Earth’s gravity,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But on the far side, it’s open to the bombardment of all the different meteorites as well as solar winds, direct effect from the solar system.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team will also look into finding water in moon soil by analysing its content and formation process.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760073_1_20240703133950.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that it is proactively promoting the development of a low-altitude economy on various fronts and a senior official will be appointed to coordinate these efforts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The use of low-altitude airspace has become a prominent topic of discussion on the mainland, with the emergence of delivery drones, flying taxis and other aircraft for emergency services and agriculture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing sees the development of a low-altitude economy as one of the new engines of growth, and the SAR government has been repeatedly urged to catch up with the national development strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco meeting, Deputy Secretary for Transport and Logistics Liu Chun-san told lawmakers that his bureau will work with the Civil Aviation Department to examine issues such as aviation safety and airspace management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of air safety, the government will take a gradual approach to start from the near to the far and from the light to the heavy to gradually widen and enrich the application scenarios of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On management of low altitude airspace, with public interest in mind, the aerial routes of AAM should be far away from populated areas. There should be a safe distance with buildings and structures and the flights should not affect the civil aircraft taking off and landing at the airport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said new large-scale development projects, such as the Northern Metropolis and the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands, can provide enough open space, community and commercial land to meet the infrastructure needs of a low-altitude economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it has approved three visa applications under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) since its launch in March.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The scheme received about 340 applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of Immigration Benson Kwok said the authorities are exploring more opportunities to boost business travel convenience in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the New CIES will bring new vitality and opportunities to Hong Kong. The Immigration Department will continue to collaborate closely with InvestHK to create an even more business-friendly environment in Hong Kong," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alpha Lau, director-general of InvestHK, said the government will continue strengthening Hong Kong as a business hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The New CIES brings a vast pool of talents to Hong Kong, attracting successful businessmen and innovative entrepreneurs, and with current application numbers an expected investment of over HK$10 billion to enhance the developmental strengths of Hong Kong's asset and wealth management industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said 80 applicants have been granted a visitor visa at this stage, to allow them to stay in Hong Kong to make investments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants are required to invest a minimum of HK$30 million in the SAR's tech and innovation sectors.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hospital Authority has formed a committee reviewing its governance and operations following a spate of incidents at public hospitals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of a review committee set up to look at the operations of public hospitals following a series of blunders said on Wednesday that there doesn't appear to be a clear mechanism in place to respond to incidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "If an accident involves human factors, such as individual healthcare personnel not following guidelines, it raises questions about how to establish a fair assessment mechanism," Tim Pang from the Society for Community Organisation said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, if it does not necessarily involve human factors, it may be related to the overall quality supervision of services or the formulation of procedural systems. The responsibility seems to fall on the management level, as they are responsible for establishing these procedures and measures. Should they be held accountable? How should they be held accountable? It seems that there is currently no clear mechanism in place to address these issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority committee is chaired by Fok Tai-fai, a paediatrician and former dean of Chinese University's medical faculty. It has seven members, including medical sector lawmaker David Lam and former head of the Urban Renewal Authority Daniel Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee is to review existing mechanisms on monitoring performance, systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will submit recommendations to the authority's governing board within three months.

 Premier Li Qiang has called for "unswerving" efforts to control floods and protect lives as heavy rain lashed various parts of the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also spoke about the need to strengthen preparedness and step up disaster relief and rescue efforts when inspecting flood-prevention work in the city of Jiujiang in Jiangxi province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a visit to a hydrological station, the premier highlighted the important role of forecasting and early warning in disaster prevention, urging efforts to strengthen interdepartmental joint consultation and improve the accuracy of forecasting.

  Meanwhile, local authorities in Anhui province said as of Tuesday afternoon, rainstorms had affected 991,000 residents and forced the evacuation of 242,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water levels of the Yangtze River in Anhui exceeded the warning mark and continued to rise.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kowloon City district councillor Rizwan Ullah says the new mainland travel card announced by the central authorities is good news for the ethnic minority community in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The permit allows non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents to have visa-free access to the mainland, with China Travel Service issuing the permits from July 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that before the arrangement, it was a challenge for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents to obtain a mainland visa, but now it is simply an online application that can be completed in under 10 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First you go online and submit the documents, second phase is a preliminary screening by the authorities and third you go to the centre and submit the documents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah also said that the new card will encourage some to grow their business in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of business individuals and traders who are Pakistani, Indian and Nepali nationals in Hong Kong who can now seize this opportunity to expand their business in the mainland."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that ethnic minority residents also see the new card as "recognition of their contributions to the country".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time former champion Tadej Pogacar won stage four of the Tour de France on Tuesday to reclaim the overall leader's yellow jersey on the first major mountain challenge in the Alps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovenian superstar Pogacar's triumph was built by his UAE Team on the ascent of the Galibier mountain with three teammates still with their leader when all their rivals had seen their sherpas dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgian Quick Step rider Remco Evenepoel finished second 35 seconds off the pace with two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark finishing fifth at 37 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vingegaard's Visma team appeared visibly weaker than during their dominant 2023 showcase second triumph on the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader, Education First's Richard Carapaz, was the big loser of the day as the Ecuadorian gave up over five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar, winner in 2020 and 2021, is attempting to become the first rider since 1998 to win both the Giro d'Italia and Tour in the same year. (AFP)

    Djokovic wins first match since knee surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic celebrates winning his first round match at Wimbledon. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760026_1_20240703081800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic wore a gray sleeve on his surgically repaired right knee while winning his first-round match at Wimbledon on Tuesday without too much of a test.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Playing his first match since tearing the meniscus in his knee at the French Open on June 3, Djokovic never faced a break point along the way to a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory over qualifier Vit Kopriva in under two hours on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Very pleased with the way I felt on the court. Obviously, coming into Wimbledon this year was little bit of different circumstances for me, because of the knee. I didn’t know how everything was going to unfold on the court, really,” Djokovic said. “Practice sessions are quite different from official match play. I’m just extremely glad (with) the way I felt today, the way I played.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He accumulated 15 break chances, converting six, and delivered his usual clean strokes, finishing with twice as many winners, 32, as unforced errors, 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were plenty of quick points, which probably was at least in part a result of Djokovic trying not to spend too much time running more than he needed to. He ended up taking 68 of the 91 exchanges that lasted four or fewer strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I tried to really focus on the game and not really think too much about the knee," Djokovic said. “Everything I could possibly do, I’ve done, along with my team, in the last 3 1/2 weeks in order to give myself a chance to be able to play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic has won seven of his men's-record 24 Grand Slam titles at the All England Club and was the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic hurt his knee during a five-set win at Roland Garros and pulled out of that tournament, then had surgery in Paris on June 5. Less than a month later, he was back in action and taking the first step toward what he hopes would be an eighth championship at Wimbledon, which would tie Roger Federer's mark for the most by a man.

    Turkey set up Euros quarter-final with Dutch

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Turkey players and staff celebrate after the match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760025_1_20240703080858.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey will face the Netherlands in the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 after winning a thriller with Austria 2-1 as both countries reached the last eight of a European Championship for the first time since 2008.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Merih Demiral was the unlikely hero for Turkey, in soaking Leipzig, after bundling his team ahead with less than a minute on the clock and then thumping in the decisive header just before the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vincenzo Montella's side, who were missing suspended captain Hakan Calhanoglu but once again backed by massive support at the Zentralstadion, will take on the Dutch in Berlin on Saturday after their comfortable 3-0 win over Romania earlier on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey were beaten 6-1 by Austria in March and Montella admitted he was hoping to get his own back for that embarrassing defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will again be able to count on their raucous fans in the German capital as they aim to replicate their run to the last four from 16 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ralf Rangnick's Austria were on top for most of the match and in particular in the second half, when they pinned Turkey back and conceded the second goal completely against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Ahli centre-back Demiral became the first European defender to score twice in the knockout stages of a major tournament since Lilian Thuram for France at the 1998 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Gregoritsch halved the deficit by forcing home Stefan Posch's flick on at another corner shortly after Demiral took his international goal tally to four in 48 caps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Austria couldn't capitalise on their dominance and went out after Christoph Baumgartner was denied a leveller in the final seconds of added time by an incredible Mert Gunok save.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cody Gakpo and Donyell Malen, with a brace in the second half, eased the Dutch through to the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Koeman's side were heavily criticised after the 3-2 defeat to Austria which led the Oranje to finish third in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were impressive on Tuesday, creating a hatful of chances and running out deserved winners in at the Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo was the Netherlands' most impressive performer and put his team ahead in the 20th minute when his rasping shot caught goalkeeper Florin Nita off-guard at his near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo's mazy dribble through a crowded penalty area led to him finding Malen who tapped home and then added the third in stoppage time to make the scoreline more representative of the balance of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whoever wins between the Netherlands and Turkey will play either England or Switzerland a week on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks jumped on Tuesday, lifting major indices to fresh records, following comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that boosted the odds for interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,509, a fresh record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq gained 0.8 percent to 18,028, also a record, while the Dow Jones advanced 0.4 percent to 39,331.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell's upbeat comments came at a panel discussion with other central bankers in Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've made quite a bit of progress in bringing inflation back down to our target, while the labour market has remained strong and growth has continued," Powell said. "We want that process to continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell "said just enough to get the traders excited as he always does," said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. "Powell most always tends toward the dovish side or typically says something neutral, but traders take the part that they like to hear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Tesla shot up more than 10 percent after reporting lower auto sales in the second quarter that still topped expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures fuelled talk that Elon Musk's automaker is poised to rebound after a tough period for electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets will close early on Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday before reopening on Friday, when the market will digest US jobs data for June. (AFP)

    Category 5 Hurricane Beryl kills 5, threatens Jamaica

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Beryl was hurtling towards Jamaica on Tuesday as a monster Category 5 storm, after killing at least five people and causing widespread destruction in a deadly sweep across the southeastern Caribbean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Though expected to weaken slightly later on Tuesday, the hurricane is still on track to slam into Jamaica on Wednesday as a "near-major" storm, bringing life-threatening winds, storm surge, rain and flash flooding, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl has already razed parts of the southeastern Caribbean as a Category 4 storm, killing at least three people in Grenada, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and one in Venezuela, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Prime Minister of Grenada, Dickon Mitchell, said the island of Carriacou – which the NHC said took a direct hit from the storm – has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened by 90 kilometres per hour winds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've had virtually no communication with Carriacou in the last 12 hours except briefly this morning by satellite phone," he told a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 35-square kilometre island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family of UN climate chief Simon Stiell is among the residents of Carriacou. His office said his parents' property was damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 90 percent of the homes along with the airport on Union Island, in St Vincent, have also been damaged or destroyed, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said. The three-square mile island has a population of around 3,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonsalves said the storm also killed one person on another island, Bequia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl "has left in its wake immense destruction, pain and suffering," he said in a Facebook video late on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man also died when swept away by a flooded river in the state of Sucre on Venezuela's northeastern coast, officials there said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barbados appeared to have been spared the worst but was still hit with high winds and pelting rain, although officials reported no injuries so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martinique was also largely spared, with damage to boats and some flooding in downtown Fort-de-France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts say it is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl is the first hurricane since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June, and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates pulled out of France's legislative election runoff by a Tuesday deadline, in a move President Emmanuel Macron hopes will block the far right from winning power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France votes on Sunday in the final round of snap legislative polls Macron called seeking a "clarification" in politics after his camp was trounced in European elections last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His gamble backfired, with the far-right National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen winning the June 30 first round. But the key suspense now is whether the RN can get enough seats to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faced with the prospect of the far right taking power for the first time since France's occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II, Macron's camp and the left have urged a broad "Republican Front" to stop Le Pen's anti-immigration and eurosceptic party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Tuesday evening's deadline to register, more than 210 pro-Macron or left-wing candidates had pulled out of contests in an attempt to prevent the RN winning seats, in what appeared a welcome development for the presidential camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Le Pen appeared to row back on previous comments that the RN would only form a government with an absolute majority of 289 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, saying it would still try if slightly below this figure.

  <br/>
  She said her party would seek to form a government and make her 28-year-old protege Jordan Bardella prime minister even with as little as "for example, 270 deputies", requiring them to find support from another 19 MPs to govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we then have a majority, then yes, of course, we'll go and do what the voters elected us to do," she told broadcaster France Inter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Bardella becomes prime minister, this would create a tense period of "cohabitation" with Macron, who has vowed to serve out his term until 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, 35, said late on Monday it "would be catastrophic for the French" to give the far right an absolute majority. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A House Democratic lawmaker has become the first in the party to publicly call for President Joe Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee for president, citing Biden’s debate performance failing to “effectively defend his many accomplishments.”
 <br>
  <br/>
  Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas said in a statement on Tuesday that Biden should “make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My decision to make these strong reservations public is not done lightly nor does it in any way diminish my respect for all that President Biden has achieved,” Doggett said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Recognising that, unlike Trump, President Biden’s first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. I respectfully call on him to do so.” (AP)

    Vondrousova crashes out, Murray bows out of singles

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro celebrates her shock victory over the reigning champ. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759998_1_20240703001200.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marketa Vondrousova on Tuesday became the first defending women's Wimbledon champion to lose in the first round for 30 years, as Andy Murray ran out of time in his fitness race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Czech sixth seed Vondrousova went down 6-4, 6-2 to Spain's unheralded Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in 66 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova is only the second defending champion to lose in the first round at the All England Club in the Open Era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other time it has happened was 30 years ago, when Lori McNeil defeated three-time defending champion Steffi Graf in the 1994 opening round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 83 Bouzas Maneiro, playing in only the third Grand Slam main draw of her career, broke her opponent five times in the match under the roof on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Until Tuesday she had never defeated a top-40 player, while her only other grass-court match this year was a first-round loss in a low-key event in Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova, who said she was wary in her first match since she hurt her hip at last month's Berlin grass-court tournament, struggled to impose her serve and made 28 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Practice was fine and everything," said the Czech. "Today I was a bit scared because of my leg too. But I don't think that was the reason. I felt nervous from the start."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added: "It's tough to go out defending the title."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a different story for 2022 champion Elena Rybakina, who cantered past Romania's Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-3, 6-1, turning the game on its head with a run of nine straight games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's fifth seed Jessica Pegula raced through her match against US compatriot Ashlyn Krueger in 49 minutes, losing just two games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men's side, Murray's camp confirmed he was not fit enough to play singles at his final Wimbledon as Novak Djokovic prepared to launch his bid for a record-equalling eighth men's crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The withdrawal of two-time champion Murray means Djokovic is the only member of the fabled "Big Four" in the men's draw at the All England Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roger Federer has retired and Rafael Nadal opted to skip Wimbledon to prepare for a shot at another Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray, 37, is hoping to end his stellar career at the upcoming Paris Games but desperately wanted to make a final singles appearance at Wimbledon, where he was champion in 2013 and 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scot, who has been ravaged by injuries in recent years, will still play doubles with his brother Jamie in what is bound to be an emotional farewell in front of his adoring British fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his back last month after being forced to pull out of Queen's, a procedure he described as "not insignificant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted defeat in his race to be fit on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his recovery since his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very difficult decision not to play the singles this year," said a statement from Murray's representatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was replaced in the draw by Belgium's David Goffin, a lucky loser from qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, born a week apart from Murray in May 1987, had a knee operation after pulling out before his French Open quarter-final – sparking fears he would not be fit in time for Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Serbian world number two, who was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz in last year's final, has said he is "pain-free" and opens against Czech qualifier Vit Kopriva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He knows time is not on his side as he bids to equal Federer's Wimbledon title record and become the first player – man or woman – to win 25 Grand Slam singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do have something that is described as a feeling of not missing out at a Grand Slam while I can still play and while I'm still active and at this level," said Djokovic, who has reached the past five finals at the All England Club. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 116 people were crushed to death at a Hindu religious gathering in northern India on Tuesday, with many others injured, a senior government official said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A large crowd had gathered near the city of Hathras for a sermon by a popular preacher but a fierce dust storm sparked panic as people were leaving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many were crushed or trampled, falling on top of each other, with some collapsing into a roadside drain in the chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attendees were exiting the venue when a dust storm blinded their vision, leading to a melee and the subsequent tragic incident," said Chaitra V, divisional commissioner of Aligarh city in Uttar Pradesh state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We... are focusing on providing relief and medical aid for the victims," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours after the tragedy, she told reporters the toll had surged past a hundred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Updated information.. is that 116 people have died," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the dead were women, according to state chief medical officer Umesh Kumar Tripathi, who told reporters "many injured" have been hospitalised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lines of ambulances rushed the injured to hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wailing women and crying men gathered outside one mortuary in the town of Etah, where many of the dead were taken, seeking news of their relatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the sermon finished, everyone started running out," Shakuntala, a woman who gave only one name, told the Press Trust of India news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People fell in a drain by the road. They started falling one on top of the other and got crushed to death."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of US$2,400 to the next of kin of those who died and US$600 to those injured in the "tragic incident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My condolences are with those who have lost their loved ones... I wish for the speedy recovery of all the injured," Modi wrote on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Droupadi Murmu said the deaths were "heart-rending" and offered her "deepest condolences." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority on Tuesday announced the list of appointees for a committee reviewing its governance and operations, following a spate of incidents at public hospitals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The committee is chaired by Fok Tai-fai, a paediatrician and former dean of the Chinese University's medical faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the seven remaining members are doctors, including medical sector lawmaker David Lam. They are joined by Tim Pang - an advocate for patients' rights - and Daniel Lam, former head of the Urban Renewal Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee will review existing mechanisms to monitor performance, systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HA expects the committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the systemic issues in public hospitals with a view to enhancing the quality of healthcare and patient safety," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee will submit recommendations to the HA's governing board within three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had earlier ordered a thorough review after a string of medical blunders and equipment failures at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This included a 50-minute power outage at Kwong Wah Hospital last month, forcing more than 20 operations to be rescheduled.

    HK Disneyland upbeat about park's prospects

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong Disneyland Resort head Michael Moriarty told lawmakers a variety of new products and events are on the way. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759969_1_20240702190033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Tuesday said he is confident about the park's performance, citing an increase in visitors and upcoming attractions featuring Marvel comic characters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The theme park earlier announced record-breaking earnings in the first quarter of 2024, while net loss shrank 83 percent to HK$356 million in the fiscal year ending September 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council meeting, managing director Michael Moriarty told lawmakers that the park aims to roll out new events throughout the year to lure visitors to come back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this summer's Pixar celebration is a fine example of that, leveraging the popular intellectual property coming out of Inside Out," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're very much excited about the Marvel expansion, what we're doing for the 20th anniversary [of Hong Kong Disneyland], and a new attraction in between that we're in discussions with the shareholders ... I think all of those, put together, really provide a significant draw to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Doreen Kong asked if there is room to further expand the park on Lantau Island, saying it is dwarfed by other Disney resorts in the region, such as the one in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung admitted there are vacant sites at Penny's Bay, and pledged to make a decision with Hong Kong's interests in mind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have land available, but we need to work out the details with Hong Kong Disneyland to optimise its use," he replied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the upbeat figures, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien told reporters that he had reservations about the resort's financial outlook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was worrying about the capital - whether they need to come to Legco and ask for money again, because the government is paying up money for everything. The bridges, tunnel... hopefully no further (government) investment in Disney," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Disneyland has not turned in a profit since 2014, even as revenue surged 156 percent to HK$5.7 billion in the last fiscal year.

    Retail sales fall 11.5 percent in May

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped by 11.5 percent in May compared with the same month last year, extending a losing streak to three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that sales slid to HK$30.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drop came after a 14.7 percent fall in April and a 7 percent decrease in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government blamed the latest slump on changes in spending patterns of visitors and residents, as well as the strength of the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said a recent increase in duty-free allowances for mainland visitors should help local retailers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector may still face some challenges in the near term. However, the Central Government's recently announced measures benefitting Hong Kong, including the further enhanced Individual Visit Scheme and the increase of duty-free allowance for luggage articles for mainland resident visitors, should help stimulate retail businesses," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the authorities will continue to stimulate the local economy and market sentiment by hosting mega events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an online press call, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said retails sales are expected to continue falling in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that the market will remain sluggish for the second half of this year, considering the speedy business downturn, together with high rent and manpower costs," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other economic factors, such as the strong Hong Kong dollar, also pose challenges to the retail industry. The difficult situation is expected to continue for some time."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies providing services deemed "essential" could be stripped of their licence to operate if they fail to comply with planned legislation aimed at enhancing cybersecurity, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A proposed new law would cover critical infrastructure spanning eight sectors, including banks and telecommunication services, with companies in these fields required to take action to prevent cybersecurity incidents and report any attacks that take place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting, Security Secretary Chris Tang said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Communications Authority could revoke or refuse to renew a company's licence if it breaches the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For other sectors, when a corporation wishes to renew its licence, we will report its work on protecting computer systems of critical infrastructure to related bodies," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the related bodies will make considerations on whether to renew or revoke one's licence based on the seriousness of an incident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether broadcasters would be included in the list of essential services, Tang said a decision would be made once the legislation takes effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environmental groups on Tuesday urged the Town Planning Board to reject a government plan to build a technology hub at the site of fish ponds in the New Territories, warning it would cause damage to hundreds of hectares of wetland conservation area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their petition came as the board began a second meeting on the proposed San Tin Technopole plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Zimmerman, chief executive officer of Designing Hong Kong, was among those who submitted a petition letter to the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want the government to redraw the boundaries of the technopole and to respect the boundaries of the wetland conservation area and buffer area. It is a very simple request. These boundaries have been here for a long time, for a very good reason,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zimmerman said the area in question is of important significance to migratory birds and is an asset that belongs to citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Conservation Officer at the Hong Kong Birdwatching Society Wong Suet-mei urged the board to reconsider the government's plan to use wetland conservation area for the hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The planning this time relies very much on a just approved Environmental Impact Assessment, but we think the report is the worst one ever conducted in the past 30 years, ever since there are conservation policies in place. We hope the board can examine the assessment under proper circumstances,” Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former observatory chief Lam Chiu-ying, who also attended the meeting, said the development proposal would undermine Hong Kong’s contributions to China’s environmental conservation policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The filling of fish ponds... will make Hong Kong the underperformer in protecting the ecosystem in China. Is the technopole necessary? Are there any alternative locations for building the hub? And why is it a must to use wetland?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government says much of the land to be used for the technopole is of low ecological value and it will seek to avoid affecting the habitats and flight corridors of migratory birds as much as possible.

    InvestHK assists 322 companies in first half of 2024

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's investment promotion agency on Tuesday said it assisted 322 companies to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong in the first half of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was 43 percent more compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  InvestHK said the companies injected over HK$38.3 billion into the economy and created more than 3,500 jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the Director-General of Investment Promotion, Alpha Lau, said these companies are from 33 economies, with nearly half from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the mainland enterprises, over the past years, the percentage had always been hovering around 35 percent, because Hong Kong is an international city that's a springboard into the rest of the world," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are unlike any other Chinese city, which is why even Chinese enterprises have to come to Hong Kong. Most of them do anyway, to set up the first stepping stone or international headquarters to go outside of China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-four percent of the 322 firms helped so far this year are from the financial services and FinTech sectors, while 19 percent are from the innovation and technology industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau also said InvestHK is currently scrutinising 310 applications received since March for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, which aims to attract high-net-worth individuals to Hong Kong. She said she expects the scheme to bring in investments exceeding HK$9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, Lau said the agency will focus its promotional efforts in the coming months on the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as in the Middle East and North Africa.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new permit for non-Chinese permanent residents of Hong Kong to travel to the mainland without a visa is proving to be very popular, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service will issue the permits from July 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee described Beijing's move as a breakthrough that will "take good care" of foreign residents of the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we're going to improve the arrangements with the China Travel Service. We'll listen to views so as to optimise the arrangements," the CE said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District councillor and deputy school head Rizwan Ullah said ethnic minority residents often find the application process for travel visas to be complicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new card will make it more convenient for students to go on study trips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of InvestHK, Alpha Lau, said foreign residents are hailing the new arrangement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, in one day, I've already gotten a lot of very positive feedback from foreign chambers to say how wonderful the Hong Kong government is for doing this, for facilitating this together with the central government," she told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Grace Citizen’s young number nine, Li Hau-yi, is a rising star in women’s football in Hong Kong. She dreams of representing the SAR, but ironically, her path to success may first take her away from the city, where she can best develop her game by competing against elite players in a professional league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to be someone who contributes to Hong Kong’s football scene. My goal is to secure a ‘first eleven’ spot on the Hong Kong team. I also hope to be a role model for others; someone people are proud to have as a friend, or a family member," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To make the next step, the 17-year-old will have to take a break from her studies to move to a side in the Chinese Super League because Hong Kong does not have a professional women’s league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said this way, she can concentrate on the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think being a footballer in Hong Kong, in my experience, is quite difficult," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I go to school in the morning at eight, and then practise until around nine or ten in the evening. Sometimes I arrive home at eleven before having to wake up early again the next day," she said, describing her average day in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   </div>
   <br/>
   Li’s teammate, Iris Kwok, 30, knows a thing or two about the challenges of playing professionally outside of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok played in the territory’s amateur and semi-professional leagues for two decades before Spanish second-tier side Rayo Vallecano added her to their roster in March. Kwok said the transition was tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The playing-level is high there, whether that is the technique or physicality, so it took a bit of time to adapt. The players are very professional and they come really prepared. Their technique is incredible and their speed is fast so, after training with them, I feel like I have improved a lot."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But joining the squad partway through the season meant Kwok was unable to register with the Spanish league, and so did not feature for the Vallecano first team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_4_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Kwok’s coach at Citizen, Leung Kwun-chung, said he was not surprised his former captain caught the eye of an overseas side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leung noted that the path Kwok has gone down is one of the things that could benefit local football in the long term, adding that Kwok’s experience abroad had inspired her teammates at Citizen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I'm trying to provide more chances for the players to play at the highest level. And once they come back, supposedly the general standard, the club standard, or the level of Hong Kong will be increased."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_6_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br/>
     Leung has been coaching Grace Citizen for two years, but he is better known for his achievements as a player. The defender and midfielder has eleven caps for the Hong Kong men's international team, and has a Premier League trophy to his name with local side Tai Po.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, as a coach, he quickly learnt that the women's game is very different; with precious few resources, but plenty of potential.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Men's football in Hong Kong, maybe they've already got the model…You cannot change too much,” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "But the women's world is totally different. Maybe they’ve just started, it’s just the beginning. We don't have the professional league, and maybe one of the advantages of that is we don't have any limitations."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_8_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
      <div class="image-title-1">
       <span>
       </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Leung said he is trying to make the most of the resources he has at his disposal. That means he is boosting social media exposure, and trying to fill gaps in staffing to maximise players’ potential.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And all this, he hopes, will raise the profile of women’s football in the SAR and attract more money and resources to the sport.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Coach Leung's philosophy at Grace Citizen is having a knock-on effect among the younger members of his squad, one that is epitomised by Li.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I am so keen to go abroad, whenever more people are sent out, it rouses my determination, which makes me work harder, and believe in myself more.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping left Beijing on Tuesday for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and state visits to Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi's entourage includes Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written statement upon his arrival in the Kazakh capital of Astana later in the day, the president said he looks forward to attending the SCO summit and discussing with all parties the future of the organisation and ways to advance cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said China and Kazakhstan have established a unique permanent comprehensive strategic partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi will discuss with his SCO colleagues development blueprints and build consensus on cooperation in the two-day summit that opened on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Xi's trip to Kazakhstan – his fifth – he will also attend various state events, including a welcoming ceremony, signing ceremony and a banquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will hold "in depth" talks with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev "on bilateral relations, cooperation in key areas, and the regional and international landscape", Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi will then head to Tajikistan for his second state visit to China's western neighbour, where he will "make new plans for the growth of China-Tajikistan relations" with President Emomali Rahmon, Mao added. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong should capitalise on the measures announced by Beijing in supporting the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said an increase in duty-free allowance for mainland residents was something that was not easy to come by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Monday, the amount was tripled from 5,000 to 15,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This has been achieved after a lot of efforts by different ministries and authorities of the central government," Lee told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's important that we make good use of the new arrangement so that the benefits will be realised to its best potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said officials will keep reviewing different measures and discuss with the central authorities ways to enhance Hong Kong's economic development and tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said as Hong Kong's economy is in a transitional phase, people have to accept that and find ways to improve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can't rest on our own laurels to just think of present success or past successes... So I urge everybody to think of innovative ways to capitalise on the new measures that have been offered to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that various measures in support of Hong Kong can bring major synergy effects.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said authorities will head to Sichuan to discuss arrangements for Hong Kong to receive two pandas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on July 1 that the central government will send the pandas to the SAR as a gift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he hopes the pandas will arrive within a few months, and he believes they will attract tourists from around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether there will be a naming contest for the pandas, Lee said the government will first go to Sichuan to discuss details of the arrangement with mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the important thing is ensure that the arrangement for the giant pandas' arrival will be smooth and safe because I know that there will be quarantine requirements and all the necessary procedures need to be followed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have experience of receiving the gifts of giant pandas from central authorities, and Ocean Park has been doing an excellent job in ensuring that they are well taken care of."

    'Soft opening would have eased gridlock on new link'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759874_1_20240702092541.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link should have had a soft opening to reduce the mega infrastructure project's novelty factor, according to the CEO of a transport consultancy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new 24-kilometre link across the Pearl River Delta opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of the congestion we are seeing at the moment, those are just novelty factors," said Alok Jai, CEO of Trans-Consult, on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And normally when we open infrastructure like that, usually you should have a soft opening - which gives people the chance to take pictures and look around and appreciate it - before you do the full opening, or proper opening, then it becomes a proper transport linkage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in the gridlock. One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain welcomed the link, saying it would take pressure off the Humen Bridge at the north of the Pearl River Delta and improve connectivity within the region. But he said he didn't think it would cut journey times between Shenzhen and Zhongshan to 30 minutes from two hours, which had been widely reported ahead of the opening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is certainly going to reduce it by 45 minutes or so. But that in itself - as far as we talk about the connectivity within the Pearl River Delta, or the Greater Bay Area - that is a significant saving in journey times," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain also said he expected the new link to take traffic away from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which is more expensive. He said Hongkongers heading to Zhongshan may opt for the new link instead of going via Zhuhai. But he said the main beneficiaries would be those living in the Shenzhen or Zhongshan areas and those using the Humen Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link consists of two bridges, two artificial islands and an under-sea tunnel.

    Girmay first black African to win Tour de France stage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wanty's Biniam Girmay celebrates on the podium after winning stage 3. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759880_1_20240702082549.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eritrean Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory in stage three of the Tour de France on Monday as Richard Carapaz took the overall race lead in Turin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ecuador's Carapaz took the yellow jersey from overnight leader Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia. The pair are level on time. Remco Evenepoel and Jonas Vingegaard are third and fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intermarche rider Girmay, 24, who gave the Belgian team its first success on the Tour, is the third African to win on the Grande Boucle after South Africans Daryl Impey and Rob Hunter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple tour winner Chris Froome was born in Kenya but competed for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay won ahead of the Colombian Fernando Gaviria and Belgian Arnaud De Lie in a chaotic finale marked by a late fall as the riders hit speeds of around 65kph in the dash to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash, in which the big favourite for the sprint Jasper Philipsen was involved, created a break in the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time race winner Pogacar, gunning for a historic Giro-Tour double, did not fall but was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two sweltering stages, the skies were shrouded grey entering the northern Italian industrial city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay is more than just a sprinter, and was aided in his victory by the absence of stage favourite Philipsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He signalled his coming of age in 2022 when he became the first African to win a one-day classic at Gent-Wevelgem, aged 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was his second Grand Tour stage win after the Giro d'Italia in 2022 where he injured an eye opening a bottle of prosecco on the podium. (AFP)

    France, Portugal scramble into Euros last eight

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France have battled their way to the Euro 2024 quarter-finals despite a misfiring attack that once again failed to click in Monday's tense 1-0 win against Belgium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It took an own goal, the tournament's ninth, with just five minutes remaining in Duesseldorf to give France a nerve-jangling victory that raised fresh questions about the form of their key forwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While France celebrated Jan Vertonghen's own goal with gusto, boss Didier Deschamps acknowledged it could have been a far more comfortable passage to the last eight if they taken a host of earlier chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No France player has scored in open play in four matches in Germany as the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann struggle to reproduce the thrilling performances which carried Les Bleus to the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deschamps's side have been worryingly inaccurate in front of goal and they needed two fine saves from Mike Maignan to keep them on level terms before Vertonghen diverted Randal Kolo Muani's shot into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France had the better of possession, played and completed more passes and had 20 shots to Belgium's five but only worked Red Devils goalkeeper Koen Casteels once before Vertonghen's own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa saved three Slovenia penalties to earn his side a 3-0 shoot-out victory after Cristiano Ronaldo redeemed himself from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last 16 clash on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal forward Ronaldo broke down in tears after missing a penalty in the first period of extra-time in the goalless tie in Frankfurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he recovered to convert in the shoot-out as Portugal scraped through to set up a blockbuster clash with France in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia battled valiantly to keep Portugal at bay, with Jan Oblak making a stunning save to keep out Ronaldo's penalty after Diogo Jota was fouled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva all scored in the shoot-out and Slovenia's trio missed, sending the Selecao through in heart-stopping fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal coach Roberto Martinez reverted to a more familiar 4-3-3 system after his side were embarrassed by debutants Georgia in their last group game when he deployed three at the back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Euro 2016 winners dominated the ball and created their first chance after 12 minutes when Silva's inviting cross just evaded Ronaldo and Fernandes could not turn home at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia, playing in their first ever knock-out match at a major competition, maintained their defensive shape well and limited Portugal's opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Real Madrid striker Ronaldo directed a soft header at his old nemesis, Atletico Madrid keeper Oblak, under vital pressure from Vanja Drkusic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Slovenian defender was booked moments later for bringing down the surging Rafael Leao as he charged towards Oblak's goal. Ronaldo smashed the free-kick narrowly over the bar with the goalkeeper at full stretch. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Double Rugby World Cup winner Portia Woodman-Wickliffe said on Monday that she will retire from the sport after this summer's Paris Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Winger Woodman-Wickliffe, 32, and the Black Ferns are defending Olympic women's gold medal during the tournament in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the World Cup in the shorter form of the sport in 2013 and 2018 having lifted the 15s title in 2017 and 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After 12 incredible years representing New Zealand in 7s and 15s, the upcoming Paris Olympics will be my last time playing in the black jersey," Woodman-Wickliffe said on Instagram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rugby has provided me more than a career, it's given me a second whanau [family] in my sisters, opportunities to see the world and experience things I never would have otherwise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One last dance with my sisters in Paris," 2015's World Rugby sevens player of the year added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's sevens at the Paris Games begin on July 28 at the Stade de France with the gold medal match two days later. (AFP)
