    Protests won't stop until bombs stop in Gaza: analyst

<div class="itemFullText">
 The growing wave of university campus protests around the world in solidarity with Gaza "will not go away" unless the bombs and bullets stop in the besieged enclave, a political commentator in Beijing said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said although the latest student demonstrations in Europe have been “milder” compared with the ones in the US, such movements will “only expand” as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eyes a “full-scale” assault of Rafah in Gaza – despite US warnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are over one million displaced Palestinians currently in the southern city of Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You cannot expect students in these institutions to stand idly by. They watched 35,000 civilians killed, most of whom were women and children. These images are on social media and people are reacting to them”, said Tangen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not a question of ‘do I support Hamas or do I support Israel’. Here, the issue is, people are dying. And such reactions will continue to grow as students realise that it’s not just their individual feelings, but collective feelings about this brutality.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests that first broke out at the Columbia University in New York before spreading across some 140 campuses in the US, have now reached universities in Europe, Australia, as well as India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel was added to the fire when President Joe Biden signed into law a military foreign aid package last month, which saw $US17 billion in arms going to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 2,500 campus demonstrators have been arrested in the US so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The interesting part of it is, you now hear President Joe Biden and many other politicians talking about ‘well, free speech is fine, but you cannot have disorder’. Where was that attitude when for a year Hong Kong suffered under these protests which were disrupting business and threatening people’s lives?” Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With many of the students calling for universities to sell off shares, assets, or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment, Tangen believes the students should be listened to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s very appropriate for the students [to make such requests]. They are not asking for armed intervention from the US in Gaza, they are simply saying ‘don't’ support an entity’ that’s [associated with] killing civilians. Stop sending bombs, weapon systems, and bullets to Israel, and then it [the protests] will stop.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Celebrations are underway across Hong Kong on Sunday to mark Mother's Day.
 <br>
  <br>
   Some restaurants RTHK spoke to said they logged a jump in business, as families flocked out to celebrate the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Others, meanwhile, bought flowers as a show of love and appreciation for their mothers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "By giving her flowers, I would say thank you to my mom for taking care of me over the years and helping me," 11-year-old Alex said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some tourists said they were quite impressed with the festivities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mrs. Wong, a tourist from Singapore, said people in Hong Kong appear to be more excited about Mother's Day compared to her home country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the culture here in Hong Kong is pretty interesting. It's a bit different from Singapore, because I do see a lot of people carrying flowers around, so it's a bit different. So, I think they place more emphasis in Hong Kong,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another visitor from Shenzhen, Mr Tien, said he and his family are here for a day trip to mark the occasion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We come to Hong Kong for traveling and shopping, and brought our kid to walk around," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee wished all mothers joy and happiness on this special day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also posted a photo of himself and a colleague preparing flowers for "the two great mothers" in his life – namely his own mother and his wife – for the sacrifices they've made for his family.

    Switzerland wins Eurovision as Gaza war casts shadow

<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland's Nemo won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel's participation during the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty-four-year-old Nemo's "The Code" won the highest score from nations' juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden's Malmo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world," a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nemo's journey towards realising their non-binary gender identity served as inspiration for the highly personal winning entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'The Code' is about the journey I started with the realisation that I am neither a man nor a woman," Nemo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Zagreb, a crowd gathered at a square to follow Croatia's Baby Lasagna, who finished second with 547 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-five nations competed Saturday but much of the focus has centred on the controversy of Israel being able to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Golan went on stage to perform her "Hurricane", both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside the arena, police pushed back protesters where more than a hundred demonstrators waved flags and chanted "Free Palestine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diverse Malmo is home to the country's largest community of Palestinian origin and according to police at least 5,000 people gathered to protest in the city in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Broadcasting Union, which oversees the event, confirmed in March that Golan would take part, despite calls for her exclusion from thousands of musicians around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same month, contestants from nine countries, including Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire. (AFP)

    'Improve working conditions to retain public nurses'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong without taking a licensing exam has its drawbacks, a lawmaker and a nursing professor said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Instead, they said it's more important to take away administrative work from existing local nurses at public hospitals and recognise their specialty to retain staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, non-locally trained nurses must pass the licensing examination administered by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong to be a qualified practitioner here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But under the government’s proposal which has been submitted to Legco for scrutiny, those trained outside of the city could come through a special registration pathway and obtain a full license, without taking the exam, after having worked “satisfactorily and competently” during a specified period in the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marking the International Nurses Day, DAB lawmaker Edward Leung noted that the attrition rate for nurses in the public sector reached 9.5 percent in 2023-24, saying the government must improve working conditions to keep staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it’s important to reduce their administrative burden and ensure their pay is on par with the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the plan to admit non-locally trained nurses could help alleviate manpower shortage at public hospitals in the longer run, it could add to the workload of local nurses in the initial phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we invite them to Hong Kong, in the very first period, we have to assign local nurses to assist them on doing their jobs and providing services. For this period, we are drawing manpower to assist the non-local nurses," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Li, vice-president of the Hong Kong Academy of Nursing, said the proposed special registration would only be a temporary measure to alleviate manpower shortage in the public sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The most important way is to offer recognition to those nurses who have specialty experience or specialty nursing qualification," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eventually, their job satisfaction should be improved and more nurses would be happy to stay at public hospitals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said offering more training spots for aspiring nurses at local institutions could be another way to alleviate manpower shortage.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said an expansion of the individual travellers scheme will bring more overnight tourists to the SAR, adding that more will be done to boost spending and attract visitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the remarks a day after Beijing announced that people from eight more mainland cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This brings the total number of cities under the solo travel scheme to 59.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will stimulate the economy and improve cultural ties between the SAR and the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government and residents are deeply grateful to the central government for their support of Hong Kong. The move will encourage more visitors to stay overnight, boosting the local catering, retail, and hotel sectors," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will help our economy and improve the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also vowed to do more to lure talent to the city, and bring in more foreign capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the external challenges like rising geopolitical tensions and a high interest rate environment, Chan said he’s confident that Hong Kong’s economy will continue to expand with the staunch backing of the central authorities.

    'Glory to HK' ban helps define red line: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said an injunction over the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong" helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme days after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the court has made it very clear what is allowed and what’s not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of this injunction was made very clear by the court. Using this song to incite seditious acts is illegal. It will definitely increase the public's awareness of this behaviour. What are the benefits? They are to provide a stronger deterrence and a prevention, and to make everyone understand what can and can't be done," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The justice chief said authorities had asked internet service providers such as Google to take down the song and are awaiting their response, adding that Google had said earlier that it would remove the song upon a court order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe everyone is very anxious and hope that [the internet service providers] will take actual action to respond as quickly as possible. Do they really follow the company’s policy [to align with court orders]? Do they really keep their word?" he questioned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said he hopes to see Hong Kong develop into a “food court” for legal services, catering not only for the needs of international companies, but also of grassroots citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The justice minister added that officials will continue to boost the city’s role as a mediation and arbitration centre.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association says chairwoman Josephine Ip will be more cautious to ensure similar incidents won't happen again." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752825_1_20240512105507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's weightlifting and powerlifting body has apologised for an earlier remark made by its chairwoman which the government said was a suspected violation of the one-China principle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association also said Josephine Ip made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence when giving a speech on May 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup, Ip mentioned that the event, which featured competitors from the SAR and Chinese Taipei, had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the sports body explained that there were initially competitors from 16 countries and regions, but ultimately only representatives from 13 nations and two regions participated in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During her speech, chairwoman Ip found that the script did not match the actual number of participating teams. She also felt that the sentence was too long. So she simplified the sentence to 'this time, we have lifters and officials from 13 countries'," the association said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She mistakenly omitted 'regions' and created misunderstanding. This was a serious oversight."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also said the speech did not mean to imply "Hong Kong independence", and that it firmly supports and upholds the Basic Law and the one-China principle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairwoman will be more cautious and will review public speeches before giving them to ensure similar incidents won't happen again, the association added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The powerlifting and weightlifting association has submitted a report to the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal said on Saturday that he is leaning towards playing at the French Open despite his second-round elimination in Rome, as Novak Djokovic laughed off being hit by a bottle which briefly cast doubt on his continued participation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay-court icon Nadal had previously said that he would only play at the French Open, where he has won a record 14 titles, if he feels competitive after a raft of injury problems over the last two years which have left him languishing 305th in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with Hubert Hurkacz - winner in straight sets 6-1, 6-3 - seemed a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid, leaving a question mark hanging over his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision, as you can imagine, is not clear in my mind today. But if I have to say what's my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way, I am going to say to be in Roland Garros and try my best," Nadal told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Physically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say I'm not playing in the most important event of my tennis career. Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then quickly fell away, Hurkacz winning without dropping a service game and seemingly without breaking a sweat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner said that he was "98 percent" sure that he would never again grace the Roman clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one will ever have a record like him on this surface. He's just bigger than the sport at the end of the day," said Hurkacz. (AFP)

    Thousands join latest protest march in Georgia

<div class="itemFullText">
 About 50,000 opponents of a foreign agents bill marched peacefully in heavy rain through the Georgian capital on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as "agents of foreign influence", has touched off a rolling political crisis in Georgia, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand the bill be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd on Saturday waved Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should hear the free people of Georgia," said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city centre, which blocked much of the city's roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi's old town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, which is controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and its allies, will begin committee hearings on the bill's third and final reading on Monday. Opposition groups had called for a fresh wave of protests from Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crisis has pitted the Georgian Dream ruling party against a coalition of opposition parties, civil society, celebrities and the country's figurehead president, with mass demonstrations shutting down much of central Tbilisi almost nightly for more than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian opponents of the bill have dubbed it "the Russian law", comparing it to legislation used to target critics of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. The European Union, which granted Georgia candidate status in December, has said that the bill will pose a serious obstacle to further integration if passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian Dream says the bill will promote transparency and Georgian national sovereignty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgian Dream, has said the law is necessary to stop the West trying to use Georgians as "cannon fodder" in a confrontation with Russia. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Julian Alvarez slots home from the penalty spot in Manchester City's win over Fulham. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752804_1_20240512011419.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City hit the top of the Premier League with one week of the season remaining as two goals by Josko Gvardiol and one each for Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez sealed a 4-0 demolition of Fulham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Burnley were relegated from the Premier League after a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur left Vincent Kompany's side five points from the safety zone with one game remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's stroll in the London sunshine, their seventh successive league win and 16th consecutive victory over Fulham in all competitions, moved Pep Guardiola's a step closer an unprecedented fourth English title in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have 85 points from 36 games, with Arsenal on 83 from 36. Arsenal can regain top spot by beating Manchester United on Sunday but City, who play their game in hand at Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday, are now two wins away from history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the type of ruthless performance City inevitably produce down the stretch in title race and they now look likely to wrap up it up at home to West Ham United next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The great players enjoy playing with great pressure," Guardiola said. "These players in the last few years have been able to do it and we are again in the latter stages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Burnley, defeat in London meant a second relegation from the top flight in three seasons. The result also kept Spurs' slim hopes of qualifying for the Champions League alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In other action, a fine second half performance saw West Ham earn a 3-1 win against struggling Luton Town at the London Stadium while Yoane Wissa scored four minutes into added time to secure a 2-1 Premier League win for Brentford at Bournemouth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sean Longstaff's equaliser in first-half stoppage time earned Newcastle United a 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion while Abdoulaye Doucoure scored a first-half winner as Everton beat relegated Sheffield United 1-0 at a balmy Goodison Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doucoure's headed goal was the 101st bottom side United have conceded this season, one more than the previous record set by Swindon Town in 1993-94 in what was then a 42-game campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton, who are in 15th place with 40 points from 37 matches, have now won five home Premier League games in a row without conceding a goal for the first time. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="James Anderson will bow out after a 21-year test career. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752802_1_20240511233930.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's James Anderson will retire from test cricket after the first match of the series against West Indies at Lord's this year, he said on Saturday, ending a 21-year career in which he became the most successful ever pace bowler.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 41-year-old has taken 700 test wickets, behind only Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan (800) and Australia's Shane Warne (708) on the all-time list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having made his debut for England at Lord's in 2003, Anderson will finish his illustrious career at the same ground his 188th test, two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible 20 years representing my country, playing the game I've loved since I was a kid. I'm going to miss walking out for England so much," Anderson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed the "Burnley Express", Anderson did not say if he would continue playing county cricket for his club Lancashire who renamed the Pavilion End at Old Trafford as the James Anderson End.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm excited for the new challenges that lie ahead, as well as filling my days with even more golf," Anderson added. "Thank you to everyone who has supported me over the years, it's always meant a lot, even if my face often doesn't show it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's first match of a three-test series against the West Indies takes place from July 10-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Thompson, chair of the country's cricket board (ECB), said Anderson deserved a fitting send-off at the home of cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we'll ever see a bowler to match Jimmy again," Thompson said. (Reuters)

    SAR slams US lawmakers’ annual report

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Saturday condemned a report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said the commission’s “so-called ‘2023 Annual Report’ ... made biased, slandering and smearing remarks against the situation in the HKSAR”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government rejected the report’s comments on safeguarding national security; the administration of justice and rule of law; safeguarding of rights and freedoms and reform of the district councils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said: “The US is once again overriding the rule of law with politics and making unfounded and fact-twisting remarks. Such attempt to undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance is doomed to fail.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On calls in the report for sanctions on SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, the spokesperson added: “The so-called 'sanctions' as mentioned in the US' so-called report is a smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate the HKSAR officials safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On calls for the SAR’s economic and trade offices in the US to lose their certification, the spokesperson added: “The HKSAR Government despised the hypocrisy and barbaric act of US politicians driven only by their own political gains, fabricating groundless excuses, and attacking the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices' legitimate and rational economic and trade promotion activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement says the SAR government will “steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of 'one country, two systems'.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Large crowds of visitors and locals flocked to the Wan Chai waterfront on Saturday for the first in a series of spectacular drone shows put on by the Tourism Board.
 <br>
  <br>
   About one thousand drones took flight at 8pm for the ten-minute spectacular, which is designed to tie in with the Buddha's Birthday public holiday and the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, both of which fall on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drones soared up to sixty metres into the air, creating a pattern in the shape of the famous bun hill which is the centrepiece of the Cheung Chau festival's highlight, the bun-scrambling competition. They also formed the shape of what organisers called a "giant peaceful bun" some 30 metres in diameter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the spectators captured the moment on their smartphones and cameras.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other shapes adopted included lions and temples to signify good luck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And visitors to the show were also in luck: for those waiting to enjoy the drones, there was free ice cream at the Wan Chai Ferry Pier.

 Kouta Watanabe struck six minutes from time to give Yokohama F Marinos a 2-1 win over Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates in the first leg of the Asian Champions League final on Saturday, earning Harry Kewell's a slender advantage ahead of the return.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mohammed Abbas put Al-Ain in front after 12 minutes when he reacted quickest to a rebound after Soufiane Rahimi's shot was saved by Marinos goalkeeper William Popp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese side pulled level with 18 minutes remaining after Yan Matheus cut in from the right to deliver a curling cross that Asahi Uenaka headed beyond Khalid Eisa to leave the tie delicately poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watanabe grabbed the winner when he slotted in from close range after Ryo Miyaichi redirected Matheus' centre into his path, with the goal given after a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The teams meet again in the UAE on May 25 with the winners taking Asia's last remaining berth at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States next year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has issued a stunning criticism of Israel's use of American weapons in the Gaza war, after Israeli forces intensified operations around the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's main international ally said in a report released on Friday that it was "reasonable to assess" that Israel has used weapons in ways inconsistent with international humanitarian law during the seven-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the long-awaited State Department report said it could not reach "conclusive findings" and stopped short of blocking weapons shipments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two allies soured earlier in the week after US President Joe Biden said he would halt some arms deliveries if Israel went ahead with a full-scale assault on Rafah threatened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US has warned that the reputational damage Israel will suffer if it storms a city where an estimated 1.4 million civilians are sheltering will far outweigh any possible military gain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday that Gaza risked an "epic humanitarian disaster" if Israel launched a full-scale ground operation in Rafah, while France urged Israel to cease its operations in Rafah "without delay".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli premier has said repeatedly that Israel cannot defeat Hamas and eliminate any possibility of the militant group repeating its bloody October 7 attack without sending ground troops into Rafah in search of remaining Hamas fighters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu struck a defiant tone on Thursday, vowing: "If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House renewed its opposition on Friday but said it saw no major operation yet against the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're obviously watching it with concern, of course, but I wouldn't go so far as to say what we've seen here in the last 24 hours connotes or indicates a broad, large (or) major ground operation," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Israeli ground troops seized eastern areas of the city, including the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but they have yet to enter its main built-up area. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beijing has expanded an individual travel scheme, allowing more mainland travelers to to visit and stay in Hong Kong and Macau. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752749_1_20240511150955.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday welcomed the news that the central government is adding eight more mainland cities, all provincial capitals, to a solo traveller scheme that will allow more mainland residents from remote areas to visit Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Beijing announced that eight more cities, including Taiyuan of Shanxi province, Hohhot of Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin of Heilongjiang, Lhasa of Tibet, Lanzhou of Gansu, Xining of Qinghai, Yinchuan of Ningxia, and Urumqi of Xinjiang, will be covered under the “Individual Visit Scheme” - bringing the total number of cities under the scheme to 59.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme allows travellers from the mainland to visit and stay in Hong Kong and Macau on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups, for no more than seven days at a time. Residents from the eight cities could apply to visit the SARs from May 27th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “All these eight mainland provincial capitals have huge populations and strong economic growth, and are cities with high levels of consumption,” the chief executive said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such a further expansion means that all mainland provincial capitals are now covered under the scheme, and it will significantly help revive the economic activities of the city’s tourism, retail, catering, and hospitality sectors, while promoting the two-way exchanges between residents from Hong Kong and these provincial capitals,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the city’s tourism chief, Kevin Yeung,said the SAR will soon ramp up tourism promotion works in these cities, and launch new tour routes and products to woo travellers - in the face of changing tourism patterns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In May and June alone, a series of large-scale events are scheduled in Hong Kong, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, Buddha’s Birthday Carnival, Le French May, Chinese Culture Festival, as well as the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We look forward to having more visitors from different cities to explore Hong Kong in depth,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, the executive director of Hong Kong Tourism Association, said these eight cities aren't the largest mainland cities, but are growing strongly and their residents could be enticed by the SAR's vibrant retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Residents from these cities may well not have travelled much outside their regions, so there's more of a chance they could have higher demand in terms of travelling [to other regions] or for shopping,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu agreed about the consumer potential from the eight mainland cities, noting that most of these cities have an average per capita GDP of 100,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he warned that the SAR must provide more transport routes to these regions to spur tourism growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Even if we don't have direct flights to these cities yet, they can use the high-speed rail to travel here, [but] this could push us to open up more airline routes with these cities. Some airlines have already been doing that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing earlier expanded the scheme in February to add tourists from Xian and Qingdao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest expansion came just two days after Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office, told the city’s tourism chief that Hong Kong must further tap into the city’s rich tourism resources to revitalise offerings amid “profound changes” in the tourism industry.

    KMB won't rule out applying for fare hike

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) on Saturday said it's not ruling out applying for a fare hike this year, after operating costs rose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The higher costs also included its investment in electric buses, with a new batch of electric double-decker buses beginning a phased roll-out on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the franchised bus operator called for more government subsidies, saying it's incurred higher costs from its spending on electric buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said earlier that it wouldn't rule out seeking a fare hike, but Kenny Kan, head of the company's corporate communications and public affairs department, stressed that the increased costs from electric buses were just one factor in this. .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Costs - whether fuel or labour - have increased. As a bus operator, our fiscal robustness and sustainability is very important," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we think there's a need, we'll definitely apply for a fare hike... But in terms of how much the hike would be, we would consider the issue of affordability."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The KMB imported 52 electric double-decker buses, and 44 are currently in service.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's inflation rate quickened last month, according to official data released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent year-on-year in April, staying in positive territory for the third straight month, according to the  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)

    Scheme finds more residents with chronic diseases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-led primary healthcare scheme has found that about 40 percent of participants who took part in screenings for chronic diseases were diagnosed with pre-diabetes, myelitis, and hypertension, 10 percent more than expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Pang Fei-chau, commissioner for primary healthcare in the Health Bureau, said the authorities have commissioned the University of Hong Kong to study the issue and come up with measures to remedy the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Based on the previous population health survey as well as our internal data analysis, [what] we've anticipated about 30 percent, but we had 40 percent [of] people who have this diagnosis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this was the reason that officials wanted academics in Hong Kong to look into the matter, Pang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His remarks came as he noted that about 20,000 people had been screened under the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme - out of a total of 35,000 residents who have signed up for the scheme’s body checks, which was more than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said most of the participants were aged between 45 and 64, and the majority were female. Pang hoped more males could also join the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes, if you ignore healthy lifestyles, it's a contributing factor to the high prevalence of chronic diseases,” Pang again stressed, adding that they will enhance health education at district health centres as well as companies that have more male staff, such as the MTR where 80 percent of staff are males.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commissioner also noted that over 500 doctors have participated in the scheme so far, 100 more than when the scheme was first launched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said 70 percent of them are charging less than the HK$150 maximum co-payment fee that the government had suggested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme, which was launched last November, aims to ramp up screening services at the grassroots level, prevent chronic diseases at an early stage, and encourage more “family doctors” to join in to provide personalised primary health care.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang said the development of these schemes may involve new partnership models between the public and private sectors.

    'Winter and summer flu seasons may be linking up'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician warned on Saturday that the winter and summer flu seasons may be merging, given the rising number of cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine said the flu season may not end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of cases is still increasing. We don't know when the situation will stabilise or even when the numbers will drop. We expect the summer flu season to start soon, so the winter and summer flu seasons may be coming together," he told a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four children had died after contracting influenza, and Kwan said many such cases were complicated with encephalopathy, and their situations could worsen in a matter of hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the condition could only be alleviated by using drugs like steroids, but the best prevention was to get a flu jab.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi said Hong Kong's quality education can attract international talent and boost the city's competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address, Choi highlighted the presence of five Hong Kong universities in the top 100 global rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to make good use of these advantages to enhance our competitiveness while attracting more quality talent to Hong Kong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We nurture more of our students with [an] international or global perspective and also expand our talent pool."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of language barriers was one of these advantages. Choi said universities taught in English, providing a welcoming learning environment for international students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that students had an opportunity to learn Chinese, enabling them to better connect with the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi added that the SAR attracted respected scholars from around the world to teach and carry out research in Hong Kong, further boosting the city's academic standing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said that at the local level, the authorities and schools have worked to enhance students' learning experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They encourage schools to organise overseas trips so students can interact with their peers outside Hong Kong and gain valuable experience through exchange programmes, she said.

    Govt helping buildings improve fire safety: Mak

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said the Legislative Council is reviewing the Building Management Ordinance, to urge tenants to carry out renovation work, especially for old buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her comments came after five people died in a fire last month in a building with substandard fire safety equipment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak told an RTHK radio programme that some buildings might find it difficult to get tenants to attend a general meeting, and the renovation charges might cause disagreements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the city had many old buildings - especially in districts like Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po and Kowloon City - and the government is reaching out to help tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Home Affairs Department has been actively assisting and helping the owners of the corporation to reach consensus among their tenants to carry out necessary repairs to maintain their building, to make sure that they will observe all the building's safety and fire safety requirements," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak added that the authorities had proposed under the amendment of the Building Management Ordinance that at least five percent of owners, or 100 owners, should vote in person for large-scale maintenance work.

    Happiness blossoms in garden for dementia patients

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dementia patients were taught to take care of plants in the rehabilitation garden in North Lantau Hospital. Photo courtesy of the Hospital Authority" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752679_1_20240510215643.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A horticulture therapy programme at North Lantau Hospital has helped to boost the confidence and mood of dementia patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 60 patients with mild to moderate levels of dementia have taken part in the project so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the programme, lasting six to eight weeks, participants performed simple tasks such as planting seeds and learned about different plant species.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More complicated activities include repotting plants in the hospital's rehabilitation garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Occupational therapist Doris Cheung said some patients had been reluctant to join the programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They usually think 'I can't do it, I'm useless'. But by the activities, they can understand that they have ability to try, they have ability to do the things they can do," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the beginning, they need assistance...but we teach them step-by-step, and then they learn what's the procedure needed for planting, and how to repot the plants, how the plants grow, and then they can document it according to our supervision or guidance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung acknowledged there's no scientific proof that such therapy can slow down the progression of dementia, but patients who took part said they were happier and more confident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think the nature of [slowing down] the illness is a positive emotion, and we want the patients to feel better in order to prevent further deterioration," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that in future, research would be conducted to see if the therapy could improve patients' physical capabilities as well.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks eked out modest gains on Friday and all three indexes posted another weekly advance as investors parsed comments from Federal Reserve officials and looked ahead to crucial inflation figures next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 and the Dow were modestly higher and the Nasdaq ended essentially unchanged. All three indexes were up for the week with the blue-chip Dow nabbing its largest Friday-to-Friday percentage advance since mid-December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commentary from several Fed officials helped set expectations as market participants looked toward next week's inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody really wants to take a big position prior to next week," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. "And we’re getting into a time of year where people seem to slip out early on Fridays."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biggest story is the decline in Consumer Sentiment, but outside of that there isn't much to hang your hat on," Carlson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic acknowledged recent clues the economy is slowing, but added the timing of rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Striking a more hawkish tone, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said it was unclear whether monetary policy was tight enough to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hints of progress toward that target will come next week when the Labour Department releases its Consumer and Producer price indexes (CPI and PPI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the crucial CPI report to show underlying "core" price of 3.6 percent year-on-year, which would be the coolest reading in over three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is geared not to raise rates but cut them, so 'higher for longer' is about as dire as it's going to unless things really fall off the table," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor & market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 39,513, the S&P 500 gained 0.16 percent, to 5,223 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.03 percent, to 16,341.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia gained 1.3 percent after TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker and a major supplier to Nvidia, reported a near 60 percent jump in April sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Novavax shares surged 98.7 percent in the wake of the vaccine maker's licensing deal worth up to US$1.2 billion with Sanofi. SoundHound AI jumped 7.2 percent after beating first-quarter revenue estimates. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French soccer star Kylian Mbappe said in a video on social media platform X on Friday that he would leave Paris Saint Germain and end his 'adventure' with the club in a few weeks time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is my last year at Paris Saint Germain. I will not stay on and I will end my adventure in a few weeks time. I will play my last match at the Parc des Princes this Sunday," said the 25-year old in his video address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been widespread media speculation that Mbappe will move to Real Madrid. Mbappe did not mention the Spanish champions in his video but confirmed he would leave France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's hard, it's hard. I did not think it would be as hard as it was to announce this, to leave my country, Ligue 1 – a championship which I have always known. But I think I needed this, the need for a new challenge after this year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Borussia Dortmund beat PSG in the Champions League semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar's state-run Qatar Sports Investment firm bought a majority stake in PSG in 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, PSG have won nine Ligue 1 titles, but it has failed to win the Champions League – a key goal for its Qatari owners. (Reuters)

    UN assembly votes to back Palestine's membership

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan shreds a version of the UN charter on stage at the General Assembly. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752695_1_20240511015308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly backed a Palestinian bid to become a full UN member by recognising it as qualified to join and recommending the UN Security Council "reconsider the matter favourably."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The vote by the 193-member General Assembly was a global survey of support for the Palestinian bid to become a full UN member – a move that would effectively recognize a Palestinian state – after the United States vetoed it in the UN Security Council last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assembly adopted a resolution with 143 votes in favor and nine against – including the US and Israel – while 25 countries abstained. It does not give the Palestinians full UN membership, but simply recognises them as qualified to join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The resolution "determines that the State of Palestine ... should therefore be admitted to membership" and it "recommends that the Security Council reconsider the matter favorably."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian push for full UN membership comes seven months into a war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and as Israel is expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the UN considers to be illegal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want peace, we want freedom," Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the assembly before the vote. "A yes vote is a vote for Palestinian existence, it is not against any state. ... It is an investment in peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Voting yes is the right thing to do," he said in remarks that drew applause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the founding UN Charter, membership is open to peace-loving states that accept the obligations in that document and are able and willing to carry them out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As long as so many of you are 'Jew-hating,' you don't really care that the Palestinians are not 'peace-loving'," UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who spoke after Mansour, told his fellow diplomats. He accused the assembly of shredding the UN Charter – as he used a small shredder to destroy a copy of the Charter while at the lectern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An application to become a full UN member first needs to be approved by the 15-member Security Council and then the General Assembly. If the measure is again voted on by the council it is likely to face the same fate: a US veto. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 60 people were injured on Friday when a seven-car passenger train collided with a locomotive and an empty train car in Buenos Aires, local authorities said, without giving details of how serious the injuries were.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Firefighters, police and ambulances were at the scene, helping evacuate people and take the injured to hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television and drone footage showed the trains head-to-head on a road bridge over an avenue in the Palermo neighborhood of the Argentine capital. The first car of the passenger train derailed and was damaged in the collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State-run train operator Trenes Argentinos said the crash happened at 10.31am and an investigation into the cause of the accident would be opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, as reported by the health authorities present at the scene, there are at least 60 people with injuries of varying severity," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services on the San Martin train line were halted, it added. (Reuters)

 The founder of collapsed oil trading firm Hin Leong Trading was convicted by a Singapore court on Friday of cheating global bank HSBC and abetting forgery, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The former tycoon Lim Oon Kuin, known as OK Lim, was convicted on three charges, local media said, in a case involving US$111.7 million that was disbursed by the bank in March 2020 as payment for two oil sales contracts that prosecutors said were fabricated.

  <br/>
  Lim, 82, who remains out on bail, will return to court for sentencing in October, media outlet CNA reported. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters opposed to expansion of US electric vehicle maker Tesla's plant in Grueneheide near Berlin clashed with police as some of them attempted to storm the facility on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some 800 people took part in the protest, according to the organising group Disrupt Tesla, which claims the expansion would damage the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video showed dozens of people wearing blue caps and face-covering masks coming from a nearby wooded area and attempting to storm the company's premises with policemen trying to prevent them, including by force. At least one protester was detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do the police let the left-wing protestors off so easily?" Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on his social medial platform X, adding that the demonstrators didn't manage to break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also showed medical personnel helping some injured people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are here today to draw attention to the Tesla factory in Grunheide for the environmental destruction here," Disrupt Tesla spokesperson Ole Becker told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also wants to highlight environmental destruction in countries like Argentina or Bolivia, brought about by lithium mining, according to Becker. Lithium is a key resource for electric vehicle batteries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We protect the freedom of assembly," Brandenburg police spokesperson Mario Heinemann said, "but we are also responsible for public order and safety. That means we will also intervene when necessary".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police confirmed that the protesters tried to enter the plant's premises, but were prevented, with several people taken into custody, and that it received a few reports of injuries. (Reuters)

    Chris Sun takes aim at social worker statutory body

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun said on the Labour and Welfare Bureau's Facebook page that it's necessary to improve the governance of the Social Worker Registration Board." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752681_1_20240510221151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Friday slammed the Social Worker Registration Board for failing to take concrete steps to ban national security convicts from becoming social workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on social media, the minister said the statutory body had failed to alter its procedures, almost two years after a law change intended to keep national security offenders out of the profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said the board had renewed the licences or approved licence applications from people who had committed serious offences in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said on another occasion, the board approved a social worker facing a rioting charge to become a member of its disciplinary committee panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current actions and decisions have seriously deviated from the spirit of the laws safeguarding national security and disregarded the overall interest of society and damaged the professionalism and credibility of social workers," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added it's necessary to improve the governance of the statutory body for the profession to get back on the right track, so as to implement the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the board, Ng Yut-ming, says he thinks there's a misunderstanding about the board's operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the present ordinance, we have a mechanism to handle all complaints or different kinds of offences against the law," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think the Social Workers Registration Board needs to establish another mechanism to handle the inclusion of national security offences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng said he's met with Sun over the matter on Friday evening, and he said the minister has agreed to meet with the board later on.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it deplored and opposed what it called "biased remarks" as well as "slanders and smears" about SAR's work in safeguarding national security made by Gregory May, Consul General of the United States of America to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  May talked about the National Security Law (NSL) at a forum recently held by a US think tank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said, "the US side has ignored the large-scale and incessant riots during the 'colour revolution' in Hong Kong that occurred in 2019 which devastated our society, livelihood and economy. It ignored the fact that it is an international practice and an inherent right and responsibility for sovereign state to enact laws safeguarding national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added, "the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR including the NSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance are precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity; and ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the principle of 'One country, Two systems' under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman reiterated, "the HKSAR Government strongly demands the US to immediately stop acting against international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in the affairs of the HKSAR."

    Russian forces attack Ukraine's Kharkiv region

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian forces on Friday launched a ground assault on Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, advancing near the border town of Vovchansk, a senior Ukrainian military source said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The assault opens a new front in the conflict which began in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv said it had sent more forces to the area as reinforcements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine chased Russian troops out of most of the Kharkiv region in 2022, but after weathering Kyiv's counteroffensive last year, Russia forces are back on the attack and are slowly advancing in the Donetsk area further south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fears grew in March over Moscow's intentions when Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the creation of a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory that he said was needed to protect Russia.

    Cooling products to fight heat stress during work

<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts on Friday urged employers to offer outdoor workers cooling products as summer approaches, saying they lower the risk of heat stress and heat stroke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A study by the Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) and Polytechnic University found that cooling vests were the most effective after testing the products on 30 workers aged 19 to 35, adding that portable fans and cooling collars were good alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Cheung, a research assistant professor at the university, said workers won't tire as quickly if they use the products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have observed that say, for example, if a participant without wearing any cooling device, then it takes around 15 minutes to complete the task," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that particular subject, after putting on the cooling vest for example, it would allow the participant to say walk for 20 minutes. In that situation, there would be around 30 something percentage increment in terms of working efficiency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that cooling devices could reduce the physiological burden on workers like reducing pulse rate and respiratory rate, and alleviate and delay work fatigue in hot environments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Bonnie Yau, executive director of the OSHC, said employers should also conduct heat stroke risk assessments for workers, after noting record-breaking monthly high temperatures this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[They should] take preventive measures based on the assessment, such as providing shade, ventilation, drinking water, rest periods and reducing the work intensity," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It actually depends on the work environment, but say for construction workers where they are working strenuously and they have to work under the sunlight. Perhaps the cooling vest would be a very good product for them to consider."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lukfook Jewellery on Friday said it had hired information technology specialists to investigate a potential data breach, after its database was reportedly hacked with the information of the group's members being put up for sale online.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local media reported that a hacker had obtained the database, which allegedly contained the information of millions of the chain's members, and was prepared to sell the information for 25,000 Tether tokens, or roughly HK$195,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to media queries, the jewellery chain stressed it attached great importance to the privacy of its customers, but it could not confirm at the moment if such information had been leaked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukfook said it has launched a probe into the incident and filed reports to the police and the privacy commissioner's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog, for its part, said it had not received any reports regarding the incident and would reach out to relevant organisations.

    Work to build Hung Shui Kiu MTR Station begins

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Friday said preparatory work had begun for the construction of Hung Shui Kiu Station on the Tuen Ma Line.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The railway firm said construction of the new station, located between Siu Hong and Tin Shui Wai, was expected to be completed in 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walter Lam, MTR’s project manager overseeing the project, said this is the first time they are adding a station to an operating viaduct, on which the Tuen Ma Line runs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s about 10 to 11 metres above ground. We have a massive high-level working platform. And we don’t want to touch anything on top -- what I mean is the existing utilities, the existing overhead lines. We have to turn off the power,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam noted that one of the biggest challenges is they only have around six non-traffic hours a week to work at the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they had recently started removing a 400-metre segment of the parapet to make room for the new station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Before we cut [the parapet], we have temporary support holding it in place, making sure it won’t move, it’s stable, and it’s safe. It won’t affect the operation on the next day,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engineer said they would, at the next stage, build a foundation for the new station that is made of pre-cast components.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hung Shui Kiu Station should open in 2030, when residents in the new development area are expected to move in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR said work was also starting this year to build new stations like Oyster Bay on the Tung Chung Line and Kwu Tung on the East Rail Line.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 8,000 students of a private vocational college have been affected by a cyber attack, the privacy watchdog said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong College of Technology said its information technology network and file server were hacked in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A ransomware group is believed to have got hold of 450GB of the college's data and the information was made public on the dark web on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not an ordinary attack, but a highly targeted and unusual cyber attack. The Hong Kong College of Technology condemns any cyber crimes and deeply apologises for any inconvenience and troubles caused by the incident," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The college said it reported the breach to the police and the privacy commissioner's office, shut down the affected system, and launched a probe with the help of independent cyber security experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it will provide credit monitoring and dark web monitoring services to those affected for half a year at no cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, the privacy commissioner's office said it was informed about the data breach on February 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said about 8,100 students had been affected and information involved included names, identity card numbers, emails, telephone numbers and addresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau urged the college to comprehensively investigate the incident and to take appropriate measures to strengthen network security to prevent further similar attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they are investigating the matter but no arrests have been made so far.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior government officials have lauded Southern District care teams for their dedication in serving the community, saying they urgently address the needs of citizens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Home and Youth Affairs Secretary Alice Mak attended a ceremony in Aberdeen on Friday to celebrate the teams' first year of operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan singled out the response to a landslide in Shek O Road last September for particular praise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that care teams were promptly deployed to various locations to provide food and other items to those affected by the landslide by boat, and helped with temporary accommodation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak, meanwhile, said the care teams have exceeded their performance targets, paying visits to 11,000 households and handling over 1,500 enquiries throughout the past year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tasks they handled ranged from home repairs, to technology assistance and form-filling support, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said the teams also organised more than 300 activities, including national education seminars, festive celebrations and policy promotion events in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said care teams across Hong Kong visited 90,000 households last year, adding that a review of the scheme will be carried out next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The first phase of the care team services last for two years and after two years we will definitely review the whole scheme and see how we can enhance and improve the scheme so that more residents can benefit and we can provide more district-based services to our residents,” she said.

    950,000 targeted in new poverty alleviation framework

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says the current poverty line may lead to an 'overestimation' of the poverty situation in Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752596_1_20240510123658.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation, in a bid to measure the city's poverty more effectively.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 555,000 senior citizens, 213,000 single-parent families and 214,000 people living in subdivided flats are included.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Legco paper, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the move was based on the latest statistics of household characteristics, employment and income conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since 2013, the official measure of poverty has been defined as living in a household with a monthly income below 50 percent of the median.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the bureau said the current measurement may lead to an "overestimation" of the poverty situation in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the 'poverty line' was formulated based on the concept of 'relative poverty', poor households will always exist under 'relative poverty' regardless of the effectiveness of the poverty alleviation work," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This may create the wrong impression to the public that 'more people become poor despite more resources being put in'. These limitations will in the long run weaken the function of the 'poverty line' in monitoring the actual poverty situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau added that officials will offer help to the three target groups through various poverty alleviation projects, and set key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the new poverty framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to discuss the paper during a welfare services panel meeting next Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan Siu-ming, an assistant professor from City University's department of social and behavioural sciences, said officials should include more people in the exercise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides those three target groups, there are also other social groups that may be under poverty or they face different social needs. For example, households [who] have children with special educational needs, or [people who are] disabled or with other serious illnesses. So I think targeting those three groups is good but not enough," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the government should improve the current measurement to give a better picture of the city's poverty situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government can release the statistics about post-intervention. And if the government claim that income is not a very accurate measure, they can supplement it by other surveys, just like counting expenses or housing types. [So] that we can more accurately [calculate] the poverty population."

    Pre-registration for dental clinics not ideal: govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pre-registration for dental clinics not ideal: govt" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752583_1_20240510104850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials have conceded that the pre-registration system for public dental clinics is not an ideal arrangement, saying a planned digital ticketing system will be a better alternative than late-night queues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the government pledged to finish the development of an electronic system within this year and provide assistance to people who are not tech-savvy to secure a slot to see a dentist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government earlier announced that from July, people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, rather than from midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some lawmakers on the public accounts committee complained that bringing forward the preliminary registration hours will not shorten queuing times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, I want to emphasise again that if we cannot meet the demand for service, then there will be a need to have a disc allocation. And if you have to ask people to come and queue, then definitely they will all try to come as soon as possible, and there will be a waiting time for them," Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told the legislators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now try to put in place a better arrangement, so the preliminary registration will be changed to 8pm the night before. I want to emphasise that this is not the ideal arrangement. But we just want to reduce the waiting time for the elderly. So the solution will be electronic registration."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that it would be a "utopian thought" to have no queues at clinics, saying it would require a large number of medical staff providing services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also be a waste of the city's medical resources, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of Health Ronald Lam, for his part, promised that an electronic system would be ready within this year, as authorities are hammering out details with the contractors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told lawmakers that officials will assist those who are not tech-savvy in making registrations on the platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the vaccination drive for Covid, there were a number of service points set up to help elderly people who are not familiar with technology to make a booking. There are still a lot of service points running in the community," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once we have completed developing the platform, we will offer assistance to elderly people should they need it via these existing service points."

 A clinical psychologist warned on Friday that he's noted a link between students' mental health and their relationships with parents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amos Cheung, a newly-appointed member of the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said the focus should be on how to improve parents' mental well-being and communication skills, so they can be good role models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent Education Bureau figures show that the number of primary and secondary school students diagnosed with mental illness has more than tripled in the past five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he'd noted from his own private practice that students' poor mental health was often related to conflict with family members, and many young people felt that "their conditions were not well understood by their parents ... and] parents have their own agendas to drive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he stressed that a variety of pressures were involved, including better identification of possible mental health issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that actually it's a multiple-factors problem. Well, first, [it] might be an indication that actually parents, teachers are now more sensitive to the mental health conditions of young people, so with improved and increased sensitivity, of course, there will be an increase of these diagnoses," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But, of course, at the same time, it might also mean that, well, the mental health conditions in general might be worsening among these students as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said students learned from adults around them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children and even adolescents, they are not fully developed and equipped in handling their emotions. Actually they learn from adults. So when the adults around them, if their mental health, if their mental well-being, if their emotional stability are actually already compromised or not established, then of course it will increase their chances of having some of the mental health issues, especially emotionally related," he said.
  <br/>
  He said the focus should be on how to improve the mental well-being and the communication skills of parents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because parents are the major key players in all of these things. So that when parents are already good emotion facilitators and communicators, then of course, the mental well-being and the student's ability to actually handle their emotions, would, of course, improve," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell tossed in a game-high 29 points and the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers pulled even in the Eastern Conference second round by beating the Boston Celtics 118-94 in Game 2 on Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mitchell had six points at halftime, but scored 16 in the third quarter and seven in the fourth. He was 10 of 19 from the field, including 5 of 7 from 3-point territory. Mitchell tossed in a game-high 33 points when Boston earned a 120-95 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland led by 12 after three quarters, and pushed the lead to 25 after a Caris LeVert three-point play with 4:58 remaining. Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters off the court at that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half, Cleveland's Evan Mobley had 21 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. LeVert [21], Darius Garland [14], Isaac Okoro [12] and Max Strus [12] also scored in double figures for the Cavaliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum had 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists for the Celtics, who shot 8 of 35 from 3-point territory. Jaylen Brown added 19 points for Boston, but was 0 for 6 on 3-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The series will shift to Cleveland for Game 3 on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland center Jarrett Allen missed his fifth straight game with a rib injury. The Celtics were without center Kristaps Porzingis, who has missed the last three games because of a right calf injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics led by nine early, but Cleveland had a nine-point lead, 30-21, after LeVert capped an 11-0 run by making a layup with 58.3 remaining in the first quarter. The Cavaliers had a 30-24 edge after 12 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston owned an eight-point lead late in the second quarter, but Cleveland closed the quarter on an 11-3 run to tie it at 54 at halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavaliers outscored the Celtics 36-24 in the third and had a 90-78 lead when Mitchell made a 3-pointer that just beat the buzzer at the end of the quarter. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel qualified for this weekend's Eurovision song contest grand finale as thousands of demonstrators marched through Sweden's Malmo on Thursday to protest its participation over the Gaza war.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Singer Eden Golan performed her song "Hurricane" in Thursday's second semi-final without incident in front of 9,000 spectators at the Malmo Arena and booked her place in Saturday's final after a televote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the day, more than 10,000 people including climate activist Greta Thunberg gathered in Malmo's main square before marching through the southern city's central pedestrian shopping street, according to police estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am a Eurovision fan and it breaks my heart, but I'm boycotting," 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alongside signs that read: "Liberate Palestine", banners that said "EUR legitimises genocide" and "colonialism cannot be washed in pink" could be seen in the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 50 protesters made it to the front of the Malmo Arena, where the event is taking place, before being dispersed by a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters also entered the Eurovision Village, where spectators can follow the concert on large screens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a different neighbourhood, about 100 counter-protesters gathered under police protection to express their support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Thursday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday wished Golan good luck and said she had "already won" by enduring the protests that he called a "horrible wave of anti-Semitism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?" said protester Marwo Mustafa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane" has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition, which opened with the first semi-final on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: "At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it." (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752575_1_20240510094938.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Faculty members of The New School, a private university in New York, on Wednesday set up a pro-Palestine encampment in the lobby of the campus building near Union Square in what’s reportedly the first faculty-led protest in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New School Free Press reported that protesting staff are calling for measures such as divestment from weapons manufacturing companies, dismissal of charges against student protesters and the removal of New York police on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 professors occupied the lobby with tents and banners reading "Faculty Against Genocide."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The staff at The New School named their encampment after Refaat Alareer, a Palestinian poet and professor, who was killed in an airstrike in December 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes almost a week after after police cleared an earlier encampment and arrested around 40 students who were subsequently suspended from the New School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the United States, with more than 2,500 people arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges cracked down immediately, while others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in the police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Boston, police detained several people on Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after demonstrators blocked a parking garage in their ongoing protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters have been asking administrators to end all research contracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which they estimate total US$11 million since 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the school issued an alert just before 2 pm local time, saying protesters were blocking the entrance to a campus parking garage and spilling onto a nearby street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About two hours later, authorities split protesters up and pushed them away from the garage. At least three people were detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters walked away continuing to chant “free Palestine.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MIT officials said later Thursday that fewer than 10 people were arrested by MIT police during the incident and the Stata Garage and Vassar Street were reopened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Didehbani, an MIT student and one of the leaders of the protest, said the decision to block the garage was part of a larger effort to bring attention to what she described as MIT’s complicity with the Israeli military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Didehbani said she has been issued a suspension and an eviction notice by the school but said MIT cannot suspend the larger student movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They’d much rather do those things than cut ties to a state that is currently enacting a genocide,” she said. (Xinhua, AP)

 Leverkusen reach Europa League final after Roma draw extends unbeaten run
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen staged a stunning late comeback to move into the Europa League final with a 2-2 draw at home against AS Roma on Thursday as they won 4-2 on aggregate and set the longest unbeaten run in all competitions including European matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bundesliga champions Leverkusen, who have also reached this month's German Cup final as they chase a treble, played their 49th match without defeat to surpass Benfica's record set from 1963–65 but they had to battle for the second leg draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xabi Alonso's side, who have 40 wins in their unbeaten run, will face Italian side Atalanta in the May 22 final in Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be a third European final for Leverkusen, who won their only continental title when they lifted the UEFA Cup in 1988 and lost in the 2002 Champions League showpiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roma knew they had a mountain to climb after losing the first leg 2-0 at home but they remained composed in an evenly contested match in which Leverkusen gradually seized control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios struck the post just before halftime, with the rebound deflecting off Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar's back, but Evan Ndicka cleared the danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Svilar then made another acrobatic save just before the break, denying Amine Adli and then blocking the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Leverkusen's pressure Roma took the lead with a penalty from Leandro Paredes just before halftime after Jonathan Tah fouled Sardar Azmoun. Paredes scored with another spot kick in the 66th minute after Adam Hlozek handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With eight minutes remaining, a Leverkusen corner confused the visiting defence, including the until then excellent Svilar, leading to defender Gianluca Mancini inadvertently deflecting the ball into his own net at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late substitute Joseph Stanisic then secured Leverkusen's place in the record books deep into stoppage time with the equaliser after a skilful move into the box to delight the ecstatic home fans and leave battling Roma distraught. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Hungary decided on Thursday to elevate bilateral relations to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision was announced during talks between President Xi Jinping and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said this year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Hungary, ushering in a new and important opportunity for the development of bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two countries should continue to be good friends, sharing mutual trust and assistance, and partners of win-win cooperation. Xi called on both countries to take the establishment of the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era as an opportunity to inject new and strong impetus into bilateral cooperation and create a better future for the peoples of both nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that China-Hungary relations are currently at the best period in history, and with a deepening political mutual trust and fruitful cooperation in various fields, the two countries have set a model for building a new type of international relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Hungarian government, at least 16 different agreements promoting cooperation with China in rail and road infrastructure, nuclear energy and the automotive industry are to be signed. (Xinhua/AFP)

 Wall Street stocks climbed on Thursday as economic data raised hopes that the US central bank is on track for interest rate cuts later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.9 percent to 39,387, while the S&P 500 jumped 0.5 percent to 5,214.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq added 0.3 percent to 16,346.

  A higher level of claims – if the trend persists – could be seen as a sign of the labour market cooling down, giving the Federal Reserve impetus to lower interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the higher unemployment claims has helped bond markets. US Treasury bond yields, a proxy for interest rates, moved lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rate cuts will depend on subsequent inflation data, he added: "We are seeing some cracks in the labour market and when that happens, that eventually leads to slow economic activity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.

  Among companies reporting results, Warner Bros. Discovery closed 3.1 percent up while Arm Holdings slumped by 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbnb shares slid by 6.9 percent. (AFP)

    TikTok says will label AI-made videos automatically

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok on Thursday said it will begin labelling AI-generated content automatically from several platforms, including OpenAI's Dall-E and the company's own tools and generators.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authentication has become a major concern in the fast development of AI, with authorities worried about the proliferation of deepfakes that could disrupt society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "AI-generated content is an incredible creative outlet, but transparency for viewers is critical," said Adam Presser, Head of Trust & Safety at TikTok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automatic labelling of AI-generated or edited content would be a first for social media platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, said it would begin testing a label "that we eventually plan to apply automatically to content that we detect was edited or created with AI."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company told the Financial Times that this will include content made using Adobe's Firefly tool, TikTok's own AI image generators and OpenAI's Dall-E.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it was joining a coalition of technology and media groups, led by Adobe, that incorporate industry-wide labelling into AI-generated products, sometimes called watermarking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (or C2PA) sets a technical standard to better flag and identify the provenance of AI-generated content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By partnering with peers to label content across platforms, we're making it easy for creators to responsibly explore AI-generated content, while continuing to deter the harmful or misleading AI generated content that is prohibited on TikTok," Presser said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok said that the auto-labelling will be gradual at first, but as more platforms mark their AI-generated content according to the C2PA standard "we'll be able to label more content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company behind the popular image generator Dall-E and ChatGPT, on Tuesday also joined the initiative and announced the launch of a tool aimed at detecting whether digital images have been created by AI. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Israeli official criticised US President Joe Biden on Thursday for threatening to stop certain arms supplies to Israel if it invades the crowded Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war," Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said on public radio in Israel's first reaction to Biden's warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has defied international objections by sending in tanks and conducting "targeted raids" in the eastern areas of Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It says Rafah is home to Hamas's last remaining battalions but the city on the border with Egypt is also crammed with displaced Palestinian civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used... to deal with the cities," Biden told CNN, in his starkest warning to Israel since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs," Biden said. "It's just wrong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erdan said Biden's comments would be seen by Israel's foes Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah as "something that gives them hope to succeed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?" he said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal battled into the second round of the Rome Open on Thursday after bouncing back from a set down to beat qualifier Zizou Bergs 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay court icon Nadal will face world number nine Hubert Hurkacz next as he continued his comeback from injury with a punishing match against his Belgian opponent which lasted nearly three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Nadal's side of the draw are last year's winner, world number four Daniil Medvedev, and the beaten finalist Holger Rune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He showed glimpses of his old self against Bergs who is ranked 108 in the world and is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outsider Bergs, 24, had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Holger Rune, and he pushed his illustrious rival all the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitting Belgian briefly looked like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take a hard-fought victory. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved sideways on Thursday following mixed earnings reports as weekly US jobless claims pushed higher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jump in initial jobless claims by 22,000 to 231,000 puts the benchmark at the highest level since last August, according to Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data "will be construed as a sign of softening in the labour market," O'Hare said. "That view, in turn, will be construed as a possible trigger for a Fed rate cut in coming months."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data came as the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was up 0.1 percent at 39,098.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,186, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,262.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among companies reporting results, Warner Brothers Discovery advanced 2.0 percent, Arm Holdings dropped 6.3 percent and Airbnb fell 7.2 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has expressed strong dissatisfaction against remarks made by the US State Department regarding the banning of a protest song in the SAR, calling it a blatant interference in the city’s judicial proceedings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman with the office said in a statement that SAR officials had made the right and necessary move to ban people from using the song to incite others to separate Hong Kong from the rest of the country, or insult the national anthem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement noted that the SAR government and the High Court had fulfilled their constitutional responsibility to protect national security as well as the dignity of ‘March of the Volunteers’.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman advised certain politicians to respect the basic principles of international relations and stop interfering in Hong Kong as well as China’s internal affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US State Department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, had earlier described the Court of Appeal’s temporary injunction order to ban ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ as “the latest blow” to the SAR’s international reputation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Xia Baolong, said the central government will continue to support the SAR's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, met Xia in Beijing on Thursday, to brief him on Hong Kong’s efforts in attracting strategic I&T enterprises and talent, as well as the city’s latest developments in areas like digital economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xia said the SAR government's work deserves full recognition, and that Beijing will continue to support Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, for his part, said the SAR administration will "live up to its mission" and continue strengthening I&T co-operation with different mainland cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Xia also met with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung, and expressed the need for Hong Kong to continue developing the tourism sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having experienced profound changes in both the internal and external environment, he said the city's travel industry needs to identify new ways to boost growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMAO chief added that the SAR should adopt the strategy of "tourism everywhere", and develop new routes and products to consolidate Hong Kong's reputation as the best travel destination.

    Mixed views on revised employment agency rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752505_1_20240509194043.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There’s been mixed reaction to the government’s revised code of practice for employment agencies that is in part drawn up to deter foreign domestic helpers from "job-hopping".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration rules regarding changes of employer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Employers of Overseas Domestic Helpers Association Betty Yung, welcomed the changes, saying it will be made very clear to workers that they should aim to complete their two-year contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this will at least help to give a very clear concept to all domestic helpers that they should complete the contract because they have signed two years, right?” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung added that the renewed guidelines will have a deterrent effect on agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She told RTHK that during the pandemic, some companies had encouraged helpers to switch jobs to boost income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the period when there were no planes, some agencies had to do their business. They had financial difficulties, so they tried to make business by encouraging some helpers to change jobs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the other hand, Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, said the revised code of practice may discourage helpers from leaving a bad working environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this kind of situation, domestic workers are very vulnerable. They are reluctant to make a report because of language barriers," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have the right to switch jobs in Hong Kong, and that is not clear in the guidelines. [It should be clearly spelled out] what domestic workers need to do if they experience [bad] working conditions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sringatin said however that the revised code, which bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers, will better safeguard their privacy.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday said the China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Tamas Sulyok at the Sandor Palace in Budapest, Xi said the friendship between the two nations had taken deep roots among the people, and cooperation in various fields had yielded fruitful outcomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also expressed his readiness to foster a good working relationship and friendship with Sulyok, increase exchanges and communication on matters of mutual interest, and jointly promote the high-level development of bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary and China, which mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations, were also expected to sign at least 16 new cooperation agreements, one of which could be a large-scale infrastructure project linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.
