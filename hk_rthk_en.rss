    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP Power says it will continue to install protective devices at its transmission towers that are more likely to be affected by inclement weather. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758799_1_20240624152506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There were calls on Monday for CLP Power to weather-proof its transmission towers to ensure they withstand the impact of inclement weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The electricity supplier said it had begun installing such facilities and would continue to do so in the coming two to three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm, which supplies electricity to Kowloon and the New Territories and most of the outlying islands in Hong Kong, set out short-, medium-, and long-term measures to deal with power interruptions, after reports of a power outage in buildings from a voltage dip on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power supply might have been affected by unstable weather as the thunderstorm warning was in force at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Short-term measures include increasing manpower and resources to minimise the recurrence of power disruptions and restore electricity as quickly as possible, while measures would be taken over the medium term to boost protection of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the long run, the electricity supplier would review its asset management and maintenance with the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Wing-yip, an electrical and building services engineer, said the firm should prioritise protective devices for its transmission towers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the rainy season has just started with typhoons expected, the priority should be on implementing waterproofing and anti-lightning facilities. There must be some kind of priority, because there's quite a number of transmission towers, with over 100 of them in the New Territories," Ho told an RTHK programme on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we need to put in place such measures, we have to be selective. Some of the transmission towers are on mountain tops, and they are more prone to be struck by lightning, so they should be dealt with first given the limited resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, CLP's senior manager on power systems, told the same programme that there would be more anti-lightning devices in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had begun installing anti-lightning devices as early as 20 years ago, for the sake of risk management. We referenced data from the Observatory, and installed anti-lightning devices at areas that were more likely to be struck by lightning," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the change in climate, there is a rising thunder frequency, so we will set up these protection devices in high, middle, and even low risk areas. We hope to do that in areas that we considered to have such a risk in the coming two to three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cheung did not say whether the firm would compensate affected residents, only noting the electricity supplier was focusing on preventing more future power outages.

    Applications open for new light public housing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Applications for new light public housing flats are being accepted at the Housing Authority's office in Lok Fu. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758801_1_20240624153949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications opened on Monday for the first batch of light public housing flats, with hundreds of hopefuls turning up at the Housing Authority's office in Lok Fu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The modular homes are a stop-gap measure designed to improve the living conditions of those waiting for public housing, with priority given to families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants, who must have been on the waiting list for public housing for at least three years, will still be eligible for traditional flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Accompanying her mother, Bibi said getting one of the new flats would help them save money on rent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the money we pay for rent in private, we can save HK$7,800. I hope my mom can get [a flat] as we don't know who can get them as there are many people applying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Law said he lives in a subdivided flat in Tseung Kwan O and has been queuing for a public unit for four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government rolled out the [light public housing] plan and I am eligible, so I came here to apply. It is undoubtedly better than living in subdivided flats, it has everything," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lee, 64, said he would like to move to one of the modular flats while he waits to get a traditional unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now I live in To Kwa Wan, one of the subdivided apartments in Hong Kong. The living condition is poor and there is [only] enough room for myself and my dog," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants will be notified by the last quarter of this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the Russian region of Dagestan on Monday said an operation against gunmen who attacked churches and synagogues and killed at least 15 people was over.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Following the neutralisation of the threats to the lives and health of citizens, it was decided to end the anti-terrorist operation in Dagestan," Russia's National Antiterrorism Committee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gunmen who stormed churches and a synagogue in the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region on Sunday killed 15 police officers and a priest, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks took place in the Dagestan capital Makhachkala and nearby Derbent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over 15 police fell victim to the terrorist act," Dagestan's regional leader Sergei Melikov said in a video posted on Telegram, adding that they "protected civilians...at the cost of their lives".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial death toll given was eight police officers and a priest. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A major fire broke out at a South Korean lithium battery factory on Monday, authorities said, with one person confirmed dead and 21 others unaccounted for as the blaze continued to rage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong, just south of the capital Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still unable to go inside and carry out rescue operation. We will carry it out once we get the fire under control," fire fighter Kim Jin-young told media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Twenty-one workers are unaccounted for now. We are planning to track their whereabouts with their contacts provided from the company," Kim added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One person was killed, and another had sustained serious burns, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images shared by the Yonhap news agency showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building. Dozens of fire engines were seen outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol issued emergency instructions to authorities, telling them to "mobilise all available personnel and equipment to focus on searching for and rescuing people," his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also warned authorities that they should "ensure the safety of fire fighters considering the rapid spread of fire".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighting and rescue efforts were ongoing, and the cause of the fire was unknown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea is a major producer of batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its battery makers supply EV makers around the world, including Tesla. (AFP)

    Civil servants must safeguard national security: Yeung

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, has said it is most important for government workers to uphold the constitutional order and national security, according to the code of conduct for civil servants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities earlier revised the Civil Service Code, which lays out 12 fundamental values and standards of conduct, including political neutrality, confidentiality, and integrity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current government term, Yeung pointed out that civil servants are obligated to protect national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 12 values are all important. If I need to choose the most important value in the Civil Service Code, I'd agree it's the first one: upholding the constitutional order and national security," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The work of civil servants is not just a job or a means to achieve personal accomplishments or earn a salary. It is a mission. Civil servants have their constitutional roles to fulfill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the government is streamlining the civil service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From March 2021 until now, our civil service establishment have decreased by some 1,000 or nearly 2,000 [positions]. We have achieved this through various means, such as using more technology and streamlining procedures. We constantly review our processes which are no longer necessary. By eliminating those procedures, we can allocate manpower to other tasks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, on dental benefits for government workers, Yeung said the government is thinking about purchasing dental services in the Greater Bay Area, so that civil servants can access these benefits across the border.

    <![CDATA[<img alt='China strategist and former director of social welfare Andrew Leung said care teams translated "empty ideas" into concrete actions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China strategist Andrew Leung says Hong Kong has made advances in the field of social welfare over the past two years, although government departments still need to take more initiative when it comes to talking to one another.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comments on RTHK's
  <i>
   Hong Kong Today
  </i>
  programme as he was discussing next week's 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the two years in office of Chief Executive John Lee and his governing team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a number of achievements, for example on the social welfare front. You know, I have been Director of Social Welfare for four years before [former Chief Executive] Carrie Lam. So I'm quite familiar with this kind of improvement of various services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The establishment of the care teams, for example, actually translates kind of empty ideas into concrete actions. So I think that's very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Care teams were announced in the 2022 Policy Address. Coming under the Home Affairs Department, they support the government's district work, including visiting the needy and providing support during incidents and emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also said many government departments still tended to operate within their own structures, undermining efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regularly, people are not satisfied with the kind of people-oriented delivery of various government systems because various departments still tend to work in silos and they just sort of follow their own rule book," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said there needed to be better coordination among government departments.

 Épée fencer Cedric Ho won gold at the Asian Champions in Kuwait on Sunday, as he steps up preparations for a first Olympics appearance in Paris this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an all-Hong Kong showdown for the gold medal, Ho edged out fellow SAR fencer Ng Ho-tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a final bout that swung one way then the next, Ho came out on top 15-14 to capture his first gold medal at an Asian Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng's silver also represented his best-ever result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the semi-finals, Ho earned a hard-fought victory over Kazakhstan's Yerlik Sertay. After falling behind early in the bout, he won four points in a row to build a lead he would not surrender – eventually winning 15-13. Ng, meanwhile, defeated Japan's world number 20 Akira Komata 10-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will be representing the SAR at the upcoming Paris Olympics.

    South Korea's Amy Yang wins Women's PGA Championship

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Amy Yang lines up a putt on hole eighteen during the final round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758734_1_20240624081847.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amy Yang of South Korea held off the field at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship for her first career major title on Sunday in Sammamish, Wash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old Yang, who arrived at Sahalee Country Club on Sunday morning with a two-shot lead through 54 holes, shot an even-par 72 to card a 7-under 281 for the week. She defeated Lilia Vu [71 Sunday], Jin Young Ko of South Korea [71] and Miyu Yamashita of Japan [73] by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang had five prior victories on the LPGA Tour, most notably at the CME Group Tour Championship last November. She twice finished as a major runner-up, at the 2012 and 2015 U.S. Women's Open tournaments. This week was her 75th start in a major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I always wanted to win a major and I came close several times, and I started doubting myself if I'm ever gonna win a major before I retire, because I've been on tour quite a while," Yang said. "I am so grateful and very, very happy to win a major."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang at one point held a seven-shot advantage over the field. Her fifth and final birdie of the day, a 4-foot birdie tap at the par-3 13th hole, put her at 10 under when the next-closest golfers stood at 3 under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a bogey at the par-4 16th, Yang landed her tee shot at the par-3 17th into the water. She made double bogey to slip to 7 under but still had plenty of cushion for the final hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all the hard work our team did together and I'm so grateful for that. All four rounds it was tough out there, but I just trusted what I prepared and I did my best all week," said Yang, who shot 70-68-71-72 during a week when only 13 players finished under par.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vu, who won last week's Meijer LPGA Classic, birdied her final hole to forge a tie with Ko for second place. Yamashita joined them with a birdie on the last hole as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vu is the No. 2 player in the world rankings and won two majors last season. She said she was not surprised Yang sailed so far ahead of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite no major on her resume before Sunday, Yang moved into sixth all-time in LPGA career earnings by taking home the US$1.56 million winner's check. (Reuters)

    England thrash USA to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Jordan took four wickets in five balls, including the third hat-trick of the T20 World Cup, as defending champions England qualified for the semi-finals with a 10-wicket thrashing of the United States in his native Barbados on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 35-year-old all-rounder, born and educated on the Caribbean island, justified his recall for this match in spectacular fashion with the remarkable figures of 4-10 in 2.5 overs as the United States were dismissed for 115.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Jos Buttler then led from the front in a blistering chase with an unbeaten 83, featuring five sixes in an over from Harmeet Singh, as his side raced to their target in a mere 9.4 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By winning so quickly, England secured a place in the last four, regardless of the outcome of Sunday's final Group Two Super Eights match between co-hosts the West Indies and South Africa in Antigua and any associated net run-rate calculations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buttler faced just 38 balls, including six fours and seven sixes, but the day belonged to Jordan, whose hat-trick was the third of this tournament, with Australia's Pat Cummins achieving the feat against both Bangladesh and Afghanistan, and the first by an England bowler in any men's T20 international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable feeling, more importantly to restrict USA and to do it in a special place like this is always nice," said Jordan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Been on a hat-trick a few times, nice to get it on target this time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buttler added: "I wanted to bring CJ back in to add a little bit of depth to the batting and we know what he is capable of with the ball. He executed it fantastically well, and a World Cup hat-trick is a great effort."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for his own form, Buttler said: "Personally it's really important I continue this into the semi-finals. I have been feeling good all year, I feel I am hitting the ball well and it is nice to get that confidence." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Monday said all of the displays are working normally at Hong Kong International Airport, after a computer glitch on Sunday caused displays, the airport's website, and the MyHKG app to stop updating real-time flight information.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said all the flight information display screens - including those in the departure halls, arrival halls, boarding gates and baggage reclaim halls - were operating normally. It said there had been a thorough check-up in the early hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority also said its website and the MyHKG app were operating normally and were providing real-time flight information. It said flights continue to operate normally but it was advising passengers to refer to the latest flight information and to allow sufficient time to check in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, Ricky Leung, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany survived a scare to finish top of Group A at Euro 2024 as Niclas Fuellkrug's stoppage-time goal rescued a 1-1 draw against Switzerland, while Scotland were eliminated after a last-gasp 1-0 defeat against Hungary whose striker Barnabas Varga suffered a sickening injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dan Ndoye's first-half goal in Frankfurt had put Switzerland on course to climb above hosts Germany into top spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fuellkrug's late header ensured Julian Nagelsmann's side advanced to the last 16 in pole position with seven points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Germans, who last won the Euros in 1996, will take on the Group C runners-up – currently slated to be Denmark – in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark, two points behind leaders England, play Serbia in their last group game on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany are also on track for a potential quarter-final clash with Spain, who have been among the best teams at the tournament so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland, who reached the quarter-finals at the last Euros in 2021, have now made the knockout stage in six successive major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Group A runners-up with five points, the Swiss will face the second-placed team in Group B in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Stuttgart, Scotland were unable to secure the victory that would likely have taken them into the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Clarke's team, who lost to Germany and drew with Switzerland in their first two games, were sunk by a goal 10 minutes into stoppage-time from Kevin Csoboth, whose clinical finish capped a rapid raid from the Hungarians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary may not secure a last 16 berth despite their victory as they have only three points from their three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four third-placed teams with the best records from the six groups will move into the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's win came at a cost as Varga was stretchered off after a sickening collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga collapsed to the pitch and was struggling to move after chasing a long cross into the area as Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn came to collect the ball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a long delay, medics took the 29-year-old from the pitch while a sheet was draped around the stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai appeared to be in tears as he consoled his stricken teammate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga was immediately taken to hospital after the incident where he was said to be conscious and talking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of Barnabas Varga is stable," the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hungarian national team player is currently in one of the hospitals in Stuttgart. We will inform you immediately if there is any news on his status." (AFP)

    Israel PM says 'intense' phase of Gaza war nearing end

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Benjamin Netanyahu made the comment in his first television interview since the war began. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758724_1_20240624054615.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that "intense" fighting against Hamas militants in the southern Gaza city of Rafah is nearly over, more than eight months into the devastating war.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The intense phase of the fighting against Hamas is about to end," Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 14 network, without providing a clear timeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't mean that the war is about to end, but the war in its intense phase is about to end in Rafah."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have described Rafah as the last Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip, and in early May troops entered the southern city, on the besieged territory's border with Egypt, despite global alarm over the fate of Palestinian civilians sheltering there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military seized the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, a key conduit for desperately needed aid into Gaza that has remained shut since then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu's interview – his first with Israeli media since the war began with Hamas's October 7 attack – was broadcast as his defence minister arrived in Washington for talks on the Gaza war and surging cross-border tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground in Gaza City, in the north of the Palestinian territory, Israeli bombardment continued on Sunday with medics and the civil defence agency in the Hamas-ruled territory reporting deadly strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has traded daily cross-border fire with Israel's army, heightening fears of all-out war particularly over the past two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu said that "after the end of the intense phase" in the Gaza Strip, Israel would "redeploy some forces to the north... primarily for defensive purposes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's visit to Washington, which he said would include meetings that are "critical to this war," follows public statements by Netanyahu concerning US military aid which have added strains to ties with the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has accused Israel's close ally and biggest military supplier of freezing some arms and ammunition deliveries during the war, which US officials have strongly rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he prepared to depart for Washington, Gallant said: "Our ties with the United States are more important than ever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, who has faced growing pressure from Israeli demonstrators demanding a deal to free hostages still held in Gaza, said he would not agree to any deal that includes a permanent ceasefire – one of Hamas's key demands in stalled mediation efforts for a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal is to return the kidnapped and uproot the Hamas regime in Gaza," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about post-war scenarios for Gaza, Netanyahu said it was "clear" that Israel would maintain "military control in the foreseeable future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also want to create a civilian administration, if possible with local Palestinians" and regional backing "to manage humanitarian supply and later on civilian affairs in the Strip," Netanyahu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar proposals Netanyahu had presented to his ministers in February were swiftly rejected by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and prompted US warnings against the "Israeli reoccupation of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two members of Netanyahu's war cabinet, former military chiefs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, left the government earlier this month over the lack of post-war plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, Israeli forces kept striking targets and battling Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza City, medics at Al-Ahli hospital said that at least five people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a facility of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its jets struck militants who "operated from within buildings that previously served as an UNRWA headquarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from UNRWA, whose facilities have come under attack before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some UNRWA buildings have been turned into shelters for displaced Palestinians during the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An early morning air raid on a family home elsewhere in Gaza City killed at least seven people, the civil defence agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, Gaza's health ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This war must stop," said Umm Siraj al-Balawi, struggling to survive in a makeshift shelter amid a field of rubble, with strung-up sheets protecting her young children from the blazing sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the needs, "delivery of any meaningful humanitarian assistance inside Gaza has become almost impossible and the very fabric of civil society is unravelling," the European Union said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the war has raged on, Israeli protesters have taken to the streets week after week demanding greater efforts to bring home the remaining hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Sunday interview, Netanyahu said that if his rule ends, "a left-wing government will... establish a Palestinian state," dubbing it a threat to "our existence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had targeted military positions in northern Israel with attack drones, after an Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon killed the commander of another armed group, Jamaa Islamiya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Israeli military said plans for a Lebanon offensive had been approved, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah responded that no part of Israel would be spared in the event of a full-scale war. (AFP)

    Saudi says 1,301 pilgrims died during hajj

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Many pilgrims simply collapsed in the scorching summer heat. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758718_1_20240624035659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia said on Sunday that more than 1,300 faithful died during the hajj pilgrimage which took place during intense heat, and that most of the deceased did not have official permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83 percent being unauthorised to perform hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort," the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tally last week, based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries' responses, put the toll at more than 1,100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arab diplomats said that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths – 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riyadh had not publicly commented on the deaths or provided its own toll until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, a senior Saudi official gave a partial toll of 577 deaths for the two busiest days of hajj: June 15, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and June 16, when they participated in the "stoning of the devil" ritual in Mina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official also defended Riyadh's response, saying: "The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgement on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi health minister, Fahd Al-Jalajel, on Sunday described management of the hajj this year as "successful," SPA reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the health system "provided more than 465,000 specialised treatment services, including 141,000 services to those who didn't obtain official authorisation to perform hajj," according to SPA, which summarised an interview he gave to the state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims with the means must complete at least once in their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi officials have said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar number to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures in Mecca this year climbed as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licences and referred their managers to the public prosecutor over illegal pilgrimages to Mecca, Egypt's cabinet said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the rise in the number of deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which "organised the hajj programmes using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca" via official channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many to attempt the hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenya's President William Ruto said on Sunday that he was ready for "a conversation" with thousands of "peaceful" young protesters who held nationwide demonstrations this week to oppose proposed tax increases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Organised on social media and led largely by Gen-Z Kenyans who have livestreamed the demonstrations, the protests have caught Ruto's government off-guard, as discontent mounts over his economic policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very proud of our young people... they have stepped forward peaceful and I want to tell them we are going to engage them," Ruto said in his first public comments on the protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to have a conversation so that together we can build a greater nation," Ruto said during a church service in the Rift Valley town of Nyahururu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His characterisation of the protests as "peaceful" came after rights campaigners reported two deaths following Thursday's demonstrations in Nairobi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate response to his remarks from the protesters, who have called for a national strike on June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations were mostly peaceful, but officers fired tear gas and water cannon throughout the day to disperse protesters near parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Kenya Human Rights Commission official said on Saturday that 21-year-old Evans Kiratu was "hit by a tear gas canister" during the protests and died in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, a police watchdog said it was investigating allegations that a 29-year-old man was shot by officers in Nairobi after the demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had "documented the death... allegedly as a result of police shooting" on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several organisations, including Amnesty International Kenya, said that at least 200 people were injured in the protests in Nairobi, as thousands of people took to the streets across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following smaller-scale demonstrations in Nairobi on Tuesday, the cash-strapped government agreed to roll back several tax hikes laid out in a new bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Ruto's administration still intends to increase some taxes, defending the levies as necessary for filling its coffers and cutting reliance on external borrowing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya has a vast debt mountain, and servicing costs have ballooned due to a fall in the value of the local currency over the last two years, leaving Ruto with few options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tax hikes will pile further pressure on Kenyans, with many already struggling as the cost of living surges and well-paid jobs remain out of reach for young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said on Sunday that the annual budget included measures to tackle youth unemployment and improve access to higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I want to assure (the protesters)... is that we are concerned about their issues," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to make sure that every child has access to higher education."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the government agreed to scrap levies on bread purchases, car ownership as well as financial and mobile services, the treasury warned of a 200-billion-shilling (US$1.5-billion) shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has now targeted an increase in fuel prices and export taxes to fill the void left by the changes, a move critics say will make life more expensive in a country already saddled with high inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya is one of the most dynamic economies in East Africa but a third of its 51.5 million people live in poverty. (AFP)

    Power cut causes chaos at UK's Manchester airport

<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights at the UK's third-busiest airport were being delayed or cancelled on Sunday after a major power cut, the airport operator said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Manchester Airports Group, which also operates London Stansted and the East Midlands airports, said Manchester Airport had been "affected by a major power cut in the area earlier this morning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Power has now been restored at the international airport in the north of England, but passengers due to travel from Terminals One and Two were told to "not come to the airport" as all flights were cancelled "until further notice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers for Terminal Three were told to come to the airport as normal, but were warned they "could be affected by delays."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airport operator said that while passengers already checked in were scheduled to depart as planned, the disruption meant "some baggage may not be on those flights."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work with airlines and handling partners to reunite affected passengers with their luggage as soon as possible," the group added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline Jet2 – which operates from both terminals – said that as well as cancelling dozens of flights, it was unable to load bags onto planes as the airport's baggage system remained "inoperable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airline easyJet, which operates flights from Terminal One, warned of "very long queues" for security, and said passengers could only board flights with cabin bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, some arriving flights were being diverted to other airports according to the airport statement, including London Heathrow and Birmingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some flyers took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to describe the "chaos," with one passenger saying they had been waiting for their bags after landing after midnight and another saying they were "stuck on the plane." (AFP)

    More firms to join scheme to fight cybercrimes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police announce this year's "Bughunting" campaign to help deter cybercrimes. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758669_1_20240623143857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A scheme aimed at helping businesses fight cybercrimes is set to be expanded this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police will partner with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data to relaunch the "Bughunting" campaign that was first introduced in 2023 to help firms identify underlying cybersecurity problems. It also provides free tests to participating enterprises to identify cybersecurity loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixty companies joined the campaign last year and 197 security loopholes were identified, with 10 percent of them of severe level and around 40 percent of high risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, the number of participating firms is expected to top 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe most corporates will not have much resources to take on cybersecurity work as they have other business to take care of, therefore we hope to use resources to help corporates to deal with their cybersecurity problems," said Baron Chan, superintendent of the police Cyber Security Division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the tasks for the authorities is to collect intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been collecting intelligence from other sources to understand the overall cyber-threat landscape. In the first quarter of this year, we analysed over 2.8 million pieces of cybersecurity threat, of which 18,758 were related to attacks against Hong Kong," said Raymond Lam, chief superintendent of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau, adding that 46 percent were related to phishing and 30 percent linked to malware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first four months of this year, the number of tech-related cases stood at 10,113 – a figure similar to last year's – involving HK$1.86 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said while most of the culprits were from overseas, officers will also keep an eye out for local hacker groups.

 Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday from McLaren's pole-sitter Lando Norris to extend his lead in the world championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lewis Hamilton completed the podium at the Barcelona-Catalunya circuit for the Mercedes seven-time former champion's first podium of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The racing may be closer than the past two seasons but Verstappen always seems to pull it out of the bag when it matters most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was his 61st career win, seventh of the season, and fourth at the track he first shot onto the F1 scene as a teenager in 2016. (AFP)

    Woman mauled by wolves at French zoo fighting for life

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three wolves in a zoo outside Paris attacked a 37-year-old woman leaving her fighting for her life, a source familiar with the case and local prosecutors said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The woman was bitten "on the neck, the calf and the back" at the Thoiry zoo around 40 kilometres west of the French capital, the source said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maryvonne Caillibotte, chief prosecutor in Versailles, said the woman's life was in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman is believed to have gone out alone for a jog after spending the night with her family in a safari-style lodge at the zoo, which it advertised on its website at between 220 and 760 euros (US$235-810) per night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lodges in the wolf zone promise "silence, rest and disconnection", according to the zoo's adverts. They offer "a one-of-a-kind, very intimate experience with the arctic wolves you'll be able to see from the living room."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman "ended up in the safari zone, which is supposed to be restricted to cars. That's where she was attacked by three wolves," Caillibotte said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it was not clear "whether she made a mistake or the trail wasn't clearly marked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First responders got to the scene "very quickly," the wolves were "moved away, then returned to their area," Caillibotte siad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The source familiar with the case earlier said the woman must have got through "security systems, a trench and an electric fence supposed to keep the animals in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police are investigating the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thoiry zoo was founded in 1968 by Paul de la Panouse, owner of a local chateau that has been in his family since the 16th Century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He recalled to regional newspaper L'Independant in April how he initially stocked the zoo with a ship loaded with 120 animals brought from Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De la Panouse sold the zoo to a group of investors in 2018. (AFP)

    Nvidia signs deal to use its AI across the Middle East

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Clients of Ooredoo's data centres in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and the Maldives will get access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing tech. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758703_1_20240623214218.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia has signed a deal to deploy its artificial intelligence technology at data centres owned by Qatari telecoms group Ooredoo in five Middle Eastern countries, said Ooredoo's CEO.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agreement marks Nvidia's first large-scale launch in a region to which Washington has curbed the export of sophisticated US chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will make Ooredoo the first company in the region able to give clients of its data centres in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and the Maldives direct access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing technology, Ooredoo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Providing the technology will allow Ooredoo to better help its customers deploy generative AI applications, Nvidia's senior vice president of telecom Ronnie Vasishta said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our b2b clients, thanks to this agreement, will have access to services that probably their competitors (won't) for another 18 to 24 months," Ooredoo's CEO Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo said in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which was signed on the sidelines of the TM Forum in Copenhagen on June 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo also would not disclose exactly what type of Nvidia technology it will be installing in its data centres, saying that it depends on availability and customer demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington allows the export of some Nvidia technology to the Middle East, but curbs exports of the company's most sophisticated chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo is investing US$1 billion to boost its regional data centre capacity by 20-25 additional megawatts on top of the 40 megawatts it currently has, and plans to almost triple that by the end of the decade, Fakhroo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has carved out its data centres into a separate company following a similar move last year to create the Middle East's largest tower company in a deal with Kuwait's Zain and Dubai's TASC Towers Holding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo also has plans to carve out its undersea cables and fibre network into a separate entity, Fakhroo said. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Yoav Gallant says "our meetings with US officials are critical to this war." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758702_1_20240623213056.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was headed to Washington on Sunday for "critical" talks on the Gaza war raging since October 7 and surging cross-border tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced hope for speedy progress on unfreezing US arms and ammunition deliveries from Israel's top ally which he said had dropped off sharply in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden has been at odds with Israel's veteran right-wing leader over Gaza's surging civilian death toll, but US officials have said they were not aware of what Netanyahu was referring to on the arms issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli premier on Sunday told his cabinet that "about four months ago, there was a dramatic drop in the supply of armaments arriving from the US to Israel. We got all sorts of explanations, but... the basic situation didn't change."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he voiced hope the issue would now be cleared up: "In light of what I have heard in the last day, I hope and believe that this issue will be resolved in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli forces again bombed Gaza on Sunday, a day after tens of thousands staged a protest rally in Tel Aviv against the government and to demand the return of hostages being held by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have also flared on Israel's northern border with Lebanon whose Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has traded daily cross-border fire with the army, heightening fears of all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gallant said he would "discuss developments in Gaza and Lebanon," vowing that "we are prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza, Lebanon and in additional areas."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that "our ties with the United States are more important than ever. Our meetings with US officials are critical to this war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, Israeli forces kept striking targets and battling Hamas, the Islamist militant group Israel has vowed to destroy over its October 7 attack, in a war that has devastated much of the coastal territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warplanes had struck "dozens of terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip, including military structures, terrorists and terrorist infrastructure" over the past 24 hours, a military statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Gaza war has raged on for over eight months, Israeli protesters have taken to the streets week after week demanding greater efforts to bring home the remaining hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening drew more than 150,000 people, according to the organisation Israel Democracy HQ – Hofshi B'Artzenu, which called it the biggest rally since the Gaza war began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many demonstrators voiced anger and frustration with Netanyahu and his far-right allies, accusing them of prolonging the war and putting the country's security and hostages at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many held signs reading "Crime Minister" and "Stop the War" while some lay on the ground covered in red paint to protest what they labelled the death of Israel's democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an address to the crowd, Yuval Diskin, a former head of Israel's domestic security agency Shin Bet, condemned Netanyahu as Israel's "worst prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, Gaza's health ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli siege has deprived Gaza's 2.4 million people of most drinking water, food, fuel and other essentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This war must stop," said Umm Siraj al-Balawi, surviving in a makeshift shelter amid a field of rubble, with strung-up sheets protecting her young children from the blazing sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are getting displaced from house to house, tent to tent, school to school," she said. "This is a war of displacement. It's a war of annihilation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lebanon's Hezbollah meanwhile said it had targeted a military position in northern Israel "with an attack drone" in response to the killing of a commander of the Jamaa Islamiya group in a strike on eastern Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said no one was injured in the attack on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had hours earlier published a video excerpt purporting to show locations in Israel along with their coordinates, amid heightening fears of an all-out conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said last Tuesday that a plan for a Lebanon offensive had been "approved and validated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah responded with threats that no part of Israel would be spared in the event of a full-scale war. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, Starry Lee, headed to Beijing on Sunday for the upcoming National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport prior to her departure, Lee said the NPC Standing Committee would be reviewing 12 pieces of legislation at the meeting, among them draft revision to the Emergency Response Law, draft Financial Stability Law and draft Preschool Education Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that five reports would be deliberated as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said it is important for Hongkongers to be aware of changes in national laws even though laws on the mainland do not apply directly to Hong Kong, given that many people from the SAR often travel and do business there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NPC Standing Committee meeting will be held from Tuesday to Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) said real-time updates on its terminal display screens were gradually resuming on Sunday afternoon, hours after a glitch in its flight information display system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AA said no flights were cancelled but a few were delayed due to the system failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Leung, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack, and that they will later examine the system in detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will actually do more thorough checking in the rest of the time... There is no hacking activity we've identified so far. In terms of maintenance, it's mainly maintained and operated by our own in-house personnel," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA has said all airport operations were normal as it was trying to fix the glitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung said he's very concerned about the incident, and told the authority to investigate the case and submit a report to the government.

    'Expand medical fee waiver to lessen patients' burden'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tim Pang of the Society for Community Organisation (third right, front row) says any public medical fee increases should not exceed 10 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO said on Sunday that a medical fee waiver mechanism that provides assistance to needy patients should be widened to include people aged 65 or above, patients receiving disability allowance and those on working family subsidies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tim Pang, community organiser from the Society for Community Organisation, made the comment after the government said it would review fees and charges for public healthcare services within this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For elderly who are receiving the Old Age Living Allowance, the existing waiving level is up to 75 years old, so we will propose lowering the eligible age to 65. Another category for waiving should be patients receiving disability allowance. For those who are already recipients of disability allowance, it means they have more needs, more frequent need to consult medical service, so it cost them more on the medical fee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For helping the low-income families, we think if they are receiving working families subsidies, it is already showing they have financial difficulties and for these families, the government should issue them a waiver. Any of the family members who have medical needs, they can waive their medical fees when consulting public doctors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on a questionnaire conducted on people's thoughts of higher medical fees, Pang said the survey revealed that some people experienced financial burden when medical bills began to pile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We find out that particularly some patients who do have higher medical expenditure to their household income, so we think the government should study this group of people, so-called poverty due to disease. We think it should be another targeted group that the government should study and also provide additional support to prevent poverty due to disease," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waiving of medical charges currently includes recipients of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, some holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly, and Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang added that any fee increases should be no more than 10 percent, to minimise the financial burden on patients.

    Govt considering law amendment to handle ride-hailing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Transport chief Lam Sai-hung says the authorities will discuss with the sector next month on how to regulate online ride-hailing services. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758675_1_20240623153656.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Sunday said the government is looking into amending the law to handle unlicensed ride-hailing services in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a television programme, Lam said he expects the quality of cab service to improve with the introduction of a licensed taxi fleet system, under which an online booking channel is a requirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether online car-hailing platforms will be regulated, the secretary for transport and logistics said the authorities were still working on the matter, and they'll further discuss it with Legco and the sector next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see whether we can amend the law to make it easier and more effective to handle unlicensed ride-hailing services. At the same time, we will see how to manage online car-hailing platforms," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We shall look into how this is done overseas. There are a lot of online car-hailing platforms on the mainland or in other Asian countries. We are looking into their laws and requirements for licences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a survey found that about 75 percent of interviewees support legalising online car-hailing services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Youth Forum interviewed more than 800 people earlier this month, and it found that over half of the interviewees said they would use online ride-hailing services instead of taxis, if the price is similar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group said introducing online ride-hailing could lead to fair competition, thus improving the service quality of taxis.

    Afghanistan stun Australia in T20 Cricket World Cup

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Afghanistan's Rahmanullah Gurbaz (right) celebrates his team's victory. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758674_1_20240623152405.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran shared an opening stand of 118 before Gulbadin Naib took over to drive Afghanistan to a 21-run win over Australia in St Vincent on Saturday and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A win for Australia would have sent the 2021 champions and India into the last four, but even a second hat-trick in as many matches from Pat Cummins was not enough to keep their unbeaten record at the tournament intact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half centuries from Gurbaz and Zadran helped the Afghans rack up 148-6 in their 20 overs, before their bowlers dismissed the Australians for 127 on a tricky Kingstown track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naib claimed 4-20 and Naveen-ul-Haq bagged 3-20, but it was the third century partnership of the tournament from Gurbaz and Zadran that laid the foundation for a win that also kept Bangladesh alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've waited for a long time (for this)," said man-of-the-match Naib.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a big moment for our nation and our people. I have no words, but thanks to the fans who supported us in our career and cricket journey ... thank God we finally beat Australia. It's a great achievement for Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have achieved many things in the last 10 years, but this is big."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India top Group 1 on four points, ahead of Australia and Afghanistan on two, with Bangladesh alone in last place, with none.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India and Australia face off in St Lucia on Monday, while the Afghans stay in St Vincent to play Bangladesh in the final Super Eight match later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh won the toss and sprang a couple of surprises by sending the Afghans in to bat and naming a team with left-arm spinner Ashton Agar in the bowling line-up in place of Mitchell Starc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the early overs it looked like the Australian bowlers would suffocate the Afghans, but the lack of a breakthrough wicket allowed Gurbaz and Zadran to settle in and accelerate through the middle overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crisp batting and hard running from the Afghans put the pressure back on the Australians, who made uncharacteristic fielding errors under the Arnos Vale Ground lights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair reached their half-centuries before Marcus Stoinis finally separated them in the 16th over, when Gurbaz mistimed a shot to David Warner at deep square leg to depart for 60.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spinner Adam Zampa removed Azmatullah Omarzai (2) and Zadran (51) in the following over and paceman Cummins sent back skipper Rashid Khan cheaply with the final ball of the 18th over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Karim Janat and Naib followed with the first two deliveries of the 20th over as Cummins became the first bowler to take two hat-tricks at a T20 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He would have taken four wickets in a row had Warner held onto a reasonably straightforward catch running in from deep point to dismiss Nangeyalia Kharote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They got 20 runs too many," admitted Marsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be honest, they played a really good game of cricket. We were outplayed tonight ... It was an off-night in the field and we own that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan made the best possible start with ball in hand with Naveen bowling Travis Head for a duck in the opening over and having Marsh caught in the deep for 12 in the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warner followed for three off Mohammad Nabi's first delivery to leave the Australians struggling on 32-3 in the final over of the power play, before the Afghans heaped more pressure on their opponents by removing Stoinis and Tim David.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The explosive Glenn Maxwell gave Australia some hope with a battling 59 off 41 balls, but his dismissal by Naib, thanks to an acrobatic catch by Noor Ahmad, all but sealed the fate of the former champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I learnt from the batting innings on how to bowl," added Naib, who also took a low diving catch to dismiss Ashton Agar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to Rashid for trusting me, it's a team effort, Rahmanullah, Zadran and also Naveen for the momentum." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The confirmation came after the Commerce Ministry said Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to consider both parties' reasonable concerns to avoid the escalation of trade frictions in a rational and professional manner, Wang said during a meeting with Habeck who is on a visit to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister added that China hopes that Germany will play a positive role in the EU, prompting the European side to meet China halfway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks," Habeck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. "We are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Habeck had said earlier on Saturday that the European Union's door was open for discussions regarding EU tariffs on Chinese exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Commission has announced provisional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese EVs by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has spoken out against the move, describing the higher duties as protectionist. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says while no power interruption was caused by the voltage dip, power supply might have been affected by unstable weather.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP said it received reports of power outage in buildings after a voltage dip in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government expressed concern about the incident and told the power firm to submit a report within four weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said at about 3am, a brief voltage dip occurred at its overhead line power supply system connecting Yuen Long and Shenzhen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said while no power interruption was caused by the voltage dip, power supply might have been affected by unstable weather as the thunderstorm warning was in force at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Fung Chuen Court in Diamond Hill, the security office said a blackout there lasted for more than an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not immediately known how many buildings were affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the utility company should enhance the capability of its power supply system, particularly the lightning protection capability of 400 kV overhead line towers, as soon as possible to withstand the impact of inclement weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse also said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will follow up with CLP on how to reduce the risk caused by the high frequency of thunderstorm warnings in these few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EMSD has told the firm to identify the cause of the incident and formulate improvement plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the latest in a series of glitches involving the power firm. Earlier this month, the government said it would ask an independent consultant to investigate CLP power outages over the past three years after more than 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for about four hours.

    Computer system failure affects flight data updates

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) said on Sunday that it could not provide real-time updates on flight information on the terminal's display screens at the airport, its website and the My HKG mobile app because of failure in the flight information display system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AA said no flights were delayed due to the incident. But it still advised passengers to allow for sufficient time to check in at the airport and to communicate with airlines on the latest flight status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, it doesn't affect the data. That's why all the airport operations, including the check-in, the landing and departure, were normal," Steven Yiu, the authority's executive director of airport operations, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What has been impacted was the fixed display to the public, including the website and also the mobile app. We found [problems with] some of the software controlling the display system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yiu said the AA was trying to fix the glitch as soon as possible, adding that there was no evidence showing that it was caused by human error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said its emergency centre has been activated, and contingency measures have been implemented to handle affected service and procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's only a problem with the display screens so it probably won't affect the flights. But because this is very important information for travellers, I hope they can fix it as soon as possible," a tourist told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another traveller complained about the inconvenience caused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It creates a lot of trouble. I don't know where I should go to check-in. I have luggage and kids with me. It's just troublesome. No matter at which airport, if such a problem occurs, and no one is assisting travellers, it must affect the reputation of the place," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said he's very concerned about the computer glitch, and that the AA should make every effort to keep passengers informed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, he called on the authority to investigate the case and submit a report to the government.

    Portugal ease past Turkey to win last 16 spot

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Portugal cruised to a 3-0 win against Turkey on Saturday and booked their spot in the Euro 2024 last 16 as Group F winners thanks to a Bernardo Silva strike, an own-goal by Samet Akaydin and a Bruno Fernandes tap-in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Silva scored his first goal in a major international tournament in the 21st minute when a cross from Nuno Mendes deflected off a Turkish defender to find the Manchester City forward ghosting alone in the area, who then smashed it past the goalkeeper to put the Portuguese ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven minutes later, Turkish defender Akaydin made a comical mistake as he tried to play the ball back to his goalkeeper who was out of position and there was nothing he could to stop it from rolling into the net despite their desperate attempts to keep it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal kept dominating and extended their lead after substitute Ruben Neves set Cristiano Ronaldo free with a long ball to beat the offside line and, after drawing in the goalkeeper, squared the ball for Fernandes who only had to tap it into an empty goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win lifts Portugal to a guaranteed first place in Group F on six points, three ahead Turkey in second and five ahead of Georgia and Czech Republic with one game to go. (Reuters)

    Belgium defeat Romania in action-packed game

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Belgium's Kevin De Bruyne celebrates scoring his team's second goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758638_1_20240623073158.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A goal by Youri Tielemans after 73 seconds and a late one for Kevin De Bruyne gave Belgium a 2-0 win over Romania in an incredible, action-packed game on Saturday that set up a final round showdown with all four teams in Group E on three points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was a Euro 2024 Saturday night special played in an astonishing atmosphere in Cologne, with the only mystery being how there were only two goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It meant that, for the first time in European Championship history, all four teams in a group are on equal points after two rounds, following Ukraine's 2-1 win over Slovakia on Friday. All outcomes are now available on the final night on Wednesday when Belgium play Ukraine and Slovakia play Romania, where four points could be enough to top the group but could also see a team eliminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania and Belgium have the advantage with a plus-one goal difference. Slovakia are on zero and Ukraine on -2 - with those goal differences the deciding factor should both games end level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were very relieved we won the game, it was very important to get three points," said Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco. "Romania gave us a bit more space that Slovakia but with the quality and quantity of our chances it would have been good if we could have scored more early on - four or five goals tonight would have been possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium, still somehow ranked third in the world by FIFA, were unrecognisable from the sluggish side shocked by Slovakia in their opening game, pouring forward and full of energy from the first whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It paid dividends immediately as Romelu Lukaku held up the ball with his back to goal before rolling it into the path of Tielemans, who drilled home a crisp, low shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later Romania went close with a header by Radu Dragusin that Koen Casteels saved well, but it was a brief respite as Belgium ran the first-half show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dodi Lukebakio’s fierce shot was well saved by Florin Nita after a trademark carving run by man of the match De Bruyne, while Lukebakio and Amadou Onana both blazed over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed only a matter of time before they scored again, but Romania weathered the storm and, knowing how they struck so devastatingly on the counter to beat Ukraine, did not panic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their fans certainly stayed behind them, helping create an amazing atmosphere as noise rained down from all four stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waves of Belgian attacks continued though, as Jeremy Doku fizzed a cross inches from Lukaku’s head, De Bruyne curled just past a post then had another shot smothered by Nita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukaku thought he had got the second after an hour, slotting home confidently from a De Bruyne through ball, only for VAR to rule it out for offside – five days after he had two goals chalked off against Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incredible end-to-end action continued with Dennis Man clean through for Romania only to shoot wastefully straight at Casteels and then, incredibly, it was the Belgian keeper who set up the second 10 minutes from time with a Sunday league, route one goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He launched a goal kick that evaded everyone and the ever-switched on De Bruyne seized on it to tuck the ball home for what could prove a priceless goal should the calculators be needed to split the teams next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania, of course, are also still in the hunt to reach the knockout stage for only the second time, having failed to even qualify for the last six World Cups following their golden era of the 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a great start to the tournament, now let's see how we deal with difficulty. We need solidarity and unity because we are still first in the group," their coach Edward Iordanescu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a most complicated group - a third goal would have been really bad for us." (AFP)

    Georgia in historic draw against Czechs at Euro 2024

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili hailed his team's "historic" first ever point after a thrilling 1-1 draw against the Czech Republic at Euro 2024 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Georges Mikautadze struck from the penalty spot for the Euros debutants in the first half in Hamburg but Patrik Schick levelled for the Czechs after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valencia stopper Mamardashvili made 11 saves in a brilliant display and was named player of the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an opening defeat by Turkey, the draw means Georgia will likely have to beat one of the tournament favourites Portugal in their third match to progress from Group F.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am quite happy and satisfied just for being here... our first point is a historic moment," Mamardashvili told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia might even have won the game at the death against the run of play, but after being sent in on goal, substitute Saba Lobjanidze hammered over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Atalanta United winger's team-mates and Georgia coach Willy Sagnol went to him at the end to try and raise his spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the three-and-a-half years I've been coaching Georgia, we've done a lot of very positive things on the pitch, but it's also a massive and very important human experience for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagnol said his squad had mixed feelings at full-time after claiming their first point but seeing two more slip between their fingers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know if the point is deserved, but for everything we've done together, I think it's deserved." he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech coach Ivan Hasek said it was a scary moment for his side, who had dominated the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last seconds it was three-on-one, we were really scared, and we survived it and we have to go on," said the coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't want to go home yet, we will fight until the very end against Turkey so we can get into the knock-out rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech goalscorer Schick limped off with an apparent calf problem in the second half and Hasek said further tests were needed, although he was not positive the Bayer Leverkusen striker would be ready for the final group match on Wednesday. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A French gendarme stands guard at the courthouse, where 11 people face trial for their alleged involvement in last month's spate of unrest in the French Pacific territory. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758620_1_20240622230647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pro-independence leader in the French Pacific territory New Caledonia will be held in France after being charged on Saturday over deadly riots last month, his lawyer said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Christian Tein, head of the CCAT group, will be sent almost 17,000 kilometres to France with the group's communications chief Brenda Wanabo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An investigating magistrate charged Tein in New Caledonia's capital Noumea on Saturday. He was the first from a group of 11 people arrested on Wednesday to be charged over the violence, in which nine people died, including two police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of people were wounded, and around US$1.6 billion of damage was inflicted during the troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not immediately say what charges Tein faces, although Noumea chief prosecutor Yves Dupas said his investigation covered armed robbery and complicity in murder or attempted murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tein's lawyer Pierre Ortent said he was "stupefied" that his client would be sent to a prison in Mulhouse in eastern France. Wanabo's representative Thomas Gruet said she would be sent to Dijon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupas confirmed that some of those arrested on Wednesday would be transferred to custody in France, without giving names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one had any idea in advance that they would be sent to mainland France. These are totally exceptional steps" for New Caledonia, Ortent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gruet said Wanabo, a mother of three children, "had never called for violence" and was "distraught" to be separated from her family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The legal system has committed every error in managing this crisis," he added, saying magistrates were "answering to purely political considerations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephane Bonomo, lawyer for another detainee, Gilles Joredie, said the prosecutor's actions were creating "martyrs for the independence cause".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riots, street barricades and looting broke out in New Caledonia in mid-May over an electoral reform that indigenous Kanak people said would leave them in a permanent minority, putting independence hopes definitively out of reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's government repeatedly accused Tein's CCAT of orchestrating the violence, to which it responded by sending over 3,000 troops and police to the territory. The CCAT has denied being behind the riots. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A boy uses a chair to transport materials as displaced Palestinian families pack their belongings to leave Rafah towards Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758616_1_20240622215939.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell on Saturday called for a probe into deadly shelling that damaged an office of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The EU condemns the shelling which damaged the ICRC office in Gaza and led to dozens of casualties. An independent investigation is needed and those responsible must be held accountable," Borrell wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, days after Israel announced a daily pause in fighting on a key route to allow more aid into Gaza, chaos in the besieged Palestinian territory has left vital supplies piled up and undistributed in the searing summer heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated UN warnings of famine with outside aid severely restricted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million population has increased as fighting rages, sparking warnings from aid agencies that they are unable to deliver aid including vegetables.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says it has let supplies in and called on agencies to step up deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza," the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, also known as OCHA, said in a briefing on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Alongside the fighting, criminal activities and the risk of theft and robbery has effectively prevented humanitarian access to critical locations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks of aid into southern Gaza, trading blame with the United Nations over why the aid is stacking up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shared aerial footage of white and black containers lined up on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and more trucks arriving to add to the stockpile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With civil order breaking down in the territory, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A deputy UN spokesman this week said the crossing "is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-seeded German Alexander Zverev fell in straight sets to Pole Hubert Hurkacz in the semi-final of the Halle grass-court tournament on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz won through 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in one-hour, 33-minute and will next play either world number one Jannik Sinner or China's Zhang Zhizhen for the title in the pre-Wimbledon warm-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-seeded Pole, winner in Halle two years ago, will bid to win his second title of the season after on clay at Estoril in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really confident on my serve," said Hurkacz who fired 17 aces including 13 in the first set and saved all four break points he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It needed to be really good," said Hurkacz after his first win over Zverev in four meetings, most recently a three-set defeat in the United Cup final, a mixed team event before the Australian Open in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That match that was a little bit sitting in the back in my mind," said Hurkacz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was like, okay, not today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is such a good competitor and is playing good tennis, reaching the final at the French (Open) and playing at a really high level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Hurkacz will aim to clinch his ninth ATP Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really love grass," said Hurkacz, the 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist. "The surface suits my game and the atmosphere here, having the full crowd is incredible." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has launched a satellite in cooperation with France to catch gamma-ray bursts in the universe's outermost regions, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage delivers a speech at a hotel in Blackpool, England, in the build-up to the UK general election on July 4. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758615_1_20240622214426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, leader of Britain's anti-immigration Reform UK party, faced strong criticism on Saturday after saying that the West provoked Russia's attack on Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with a British media outlet on Friday, Farage said "we've provoked this war", while adding that "of course" it was Russian president Vladimir Putin's "fault".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters that Farage's claim was "completely wrong and only plays into Putin's hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour leader Keir Starmer, who looks set to take Sunak's job after an election next month, said Farage's comments were "disgraceful".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anyone who is standing for parliament ought to be really clear that Russia is the aggressor", he told reporters on the campaign trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage -- a former European Union parliamentarian who has tried and failed to run for Westminster seven times -- is seeking a seat for Clacton in east England in the country's general election next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His party is polling third behind the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour parties, but is only predicted to pick up a few seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, a surge of popularity for Reform UK since Farage took over as leader this month risks drawing away votes that the Conservative party sorely needs to win a fifth term in power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments met with outrage on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister James Cleverly criticised Farage for "echoing Putin's vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood called the comments "shocking" in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, adding that "Churchill will be turning in his grave".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Labour's defence spokesman John Healey called the comments "disgraceful" and said his stance made him "unfit for any political office in our country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Probed further on his views on Putin in the interview, Farage said that he "disliked him as a person" but "admired him as a political operator because he's managed to take control of running Russia".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Brexit figurehead, Farage is close to former US President Donald Trump, who has said he gets along with Putin "great".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage has also spoken about his intention to run for prime minister in 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stood by claims that Sunak, the first UK prime minister of colour, does not "understand our culture", in response to Sunak leaving D-Day commemorations in France early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He clarified in the interview that he meant Sunak was "too upper class".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage's comments on Sunak -- first made in a political leaders debate -- also drew criticism, with one Tory minister saying they made him "very uncomfortable". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday arrested a man on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend at a Fanling flat on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 59-year-old suspect called the police at 5.23 pm on Saturday to report that a woman was unresponsive at a flat in Wah Min House on Wah Sum Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramedics arrived ten minutes later and declared the woman dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Po assistant commander Brian Chung said the woman had sustained multiple bruises and arrested the man on the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death, he added, and investigations are continuing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner of Police, Raymond Siu, on Saturday said the force will “resolutely enforce the law” if anyone attempts to incite or commit illegal acts that undermine social peace and the security of Hong Kong and the nation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a graduation ceremony at the Hong Kong Police College, Siu also noted that the force is stepping up online and offline intelligence gathering ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we are aware of any attempt to disrupt social peace, we shall certainly act quickly,” he told reporters after attending the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We shall make appropriate deployments to maintain national security and also Hong Kong's public safety and order. We shall make sure there are sufficient numbers of officers on duty on July 1 to ensure that all celebrations are conducted in a safer and orderly manner,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that "while society seems peaceful on the surface, there are still many ‘undercurrents’".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “External forces or some anti-China rioters, who have fled Hong Kong, have attempted to smear the National Security Law via various means, or incite others to hate the central government and the SAR government, I call on the public to be careful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Siu said there had been a significant rise in burglary cases in the city, with the number rising by 30 percent year-on-year to 604 in the first five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said village houses were especially vulnerable with break-ins rising by 170 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the cases to increased travel and called on the public to lock doors and windows when going out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course, we have also stepped up patrols - especially in areas where there are village houses,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of the city's overall criminal cases, meanwhile, stood at 36,940 in the first five months of the year, increasing by three percent from the same period a year ago, according to Siu.

    Tourism Board lauds social media portrayal of HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Director of the Hong Kong Tourism Board on Saturday hailed the usage of social media in promoting the SAR, as he hinted at new incentives in the pipeline ahead of summer holiday season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Dane Cheng said that since visitors were now focusing more on having “in-depth experiences” during their trips, and not specifically travelling for “shopping”, the board has been collaborating with social media platforms to provide travel-related content to woo visitors, including inviting influencers visit the SAR to share their travel tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we've been very effective and particularly in the mainland and overseas. A lot of the time, I think it's important that these social media are reposted or retweeted organically,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The important thing is that he content has to be genuine and authentic.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also hinted that the board was preparing a raft of new incentives for summer, and more details would be revealed next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said in the face of strong competition from Japan and the rest of Asia, there would be more event promotion to attract long-haul visitors, especially from Europe and America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Particularly with the new measure that China is increasingly opening up visa-free visits from a lot of the overseas countries. That would give Hong Kong tremendous advantages, because people can come to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong going into the mainland,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland has recently been offering more countries visa-free travel, the latest being Australia and New Zealand following Premier Li Qiang's visit to the two countries earlier this month..

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Respiratory health expert David Hui on Saturday said Hong Kong may have to use different flu jabs if the flu season continues until the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Professor Hui said many people had been vaccinated so outbreaks have not been large in scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the SAR may also need to import vaccines from the Southern Hemisphere, where it is currently winter and the main flu season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If small-scale outbreaks continue - from the beginning of the year until the end - we'll have to import southern hemisphere vaccines in the second quarter of the year, and import northern hemisphere vaccines in the fourth quarter," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui added that people who had not been vaccinated during winter, could still get their vaccines now.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa has further postponed the Boeing Starliner's return to Earth from the International Space Station with its first crew of astronauts, to allow more time for review of technical issues encountered, the agency said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It did not set a new date, raising questions about the timing of the return of the two astronauts on Boeing's first crewed mission, which had initially been set for June 26, itself a pushback from the first potential date of June 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following the station’s two planned spacewalks on June 24 and July 2," Nasa said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, lifted off on June 5 as a final demonstration to obtain routine flight certification from Nasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process," said Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew programme manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station," Stich said, adding that the additional time would yield "valuable insight" into system upgrades for future missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crewed test of the spacecraft, test-flown to space two times since 2019 without humans on board, has encountered five failures of its 28 manoeuvring thrusters, five leaks of helium gas meant to pressurise those thrusters, and a slow-moving propellant valve that signalled unfixed past issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issues and the additional tests run by Nasa and Boeing call into question when exactly Starliner's crew will be able to make the roughly six-hour return journey home, and add to the programme's broader problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has spent US$1.5 billion in cost overruns beyond its US$4.5-billion Nasa development contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa wants Starliner to become a second US spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts with the ISS, alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, its primary ride since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Boeing's Starliner programme has battled software glitches, design problems and subcontractor disputes for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Starliner arrived in the space station's vicinity to dock on June 6, the five thruster failures prevented a close approach by the spacecraft until Boeing made a fix.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It rewrote software and tweaked some procedures to revive four of them and proceed with a docking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner's undocking and return to Earth represent the spacecraft's most complicated phases of its test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials have said they want to better understand the cause of the thruster failures, valve issue and helium leaks before Starliner begins its return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While just one thruster remains dead in Starliner's current flight, Boeing encountered four thruster problems during the capsule's uncrewed return from space in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flight rules set by Boeing and Nasa require Starliner's manoeuvring thrusters to allow for "six degrees of freedom of control," at a minimum, and each have one backup thruster, a Nasa spokesperson told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That could mean at least 12 of the 28 thrusters, most of them backups, are required for a safe flight. (Reuters)

 A shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said. The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 112 km south of Little Rock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody," Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident," she said. (Reuters)

    Taxi fleets must maintain service quality: government

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the service quality of some taxi drivers was disappointing, but he expects the situation to improve with the introduction of a licensed taxi fleet system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government is expected to approve up to five licences out of 15 applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Lam said taxi fleets must maintain their service quality level to keep the licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Transport Department will monitor the taxi fleets to see whether they are performing well and offer reminders if they are not. In the worst case scenario, we can cancel their licence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's a monitoring system, so I'm confident the taxi fleets will provide a high-quality service and therefore enhance the service quality for the whole taxi industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam also said the authorities are looking into whether licences are needed for ride-hailing services. He said discussions will be made with the sector and lawmakers in July.

    Being the Chief Executive is a mission, says John Lee

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says he has nothing else in mind but to complete his mission and accomplish the best results during his tenure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Asked about whether he would seek re-election during a media interview, the SAR leader said "being the Chief Executive is a mission". Lee's current five-year term ends in June 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this mission, there is only one thought. You execute your tasks to the best of your abilities; always be dedicated, selfless and try to do as much as possible. Treat that as your only mission, think about nothing else and you will achieve the best results and satisfy the mission's requirements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's top official also refused to rate his own performance, only saying he would leave it to others to assess his work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if there had been difficult calls to make over the past two years, Lee said none of the decisions were easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm pleased to see that so far I get a lot of support from my team, which helps me in making difficult decisions. And I am thankful to a lot of people who are very willing to offer their opinions to me. That also helps me to make difficult decisions," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But all decisions are difficult. There's no easy thing for the Chief Executive, when I have to take care of the interests of 7.5 million people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Likewise, Lee felt it was hard to gauge the individual performances of his cabinet officials, given that "each policy has a different starting point". That said, he acknowledged all of them had met his requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would describe my team as a boat. This boat, firstly, has to move forward. Secondly, it has to move faster and faster. Thirdly, and most importantly, it has to be in the right direction. If it's in the right direction, we will eventually reach our destination. If [the boat] is faster, we'll get there faster," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After [reaching] one goal, we move on to the next and handle things one step at a time."

    Vital to prepare for economic transition, says CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has stressed the need to rethink how Hong Kong should position itself amid an economic transition, while warning of challenges brought by geopolitical uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Having served nearly two years in office, the city's leader said it's important to quickly identify ways to address changes the SAR is now experiencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must try to shorten the awakening and recognition phases as much as possible,” Lee said in a media interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we see changes, instead of remaining in the old way of thinking, it is better to recognise early that it is time to transform and acknowledge the need to make changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR leader noted, for example, some businesses have stopped chasing sales figures and are now looking for ways to improve service quality instead .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After completing "the most important political task" of passing Basic Law Article 23 legislation, Hong Kong can now focus on the economy and people's livelihood, Lee added, noting the economy has rebounded from contractions when he first took office in July 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chief Executive cautioned the SAR would continue to be affected by geopolitical uncertainties, as well as foreign interference in the city’s affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[There is] no use [for foreign countries] to try to make use of Hong Kong as a political tool to try to, for example, pressure our country or pressure Hong Kong, in order to achieve their political purpose... It will backfire, because by doing that, they lose their credibility in their own citizens," Lee warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sound financial development is also key to avoid political instability, Lee added, judging from his exchanges with consuls-general in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, he confirmed plans to embark on more duty visits overseas. His cabinet will start with regions which "bring the best return", such as Asean member nations and the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said Europe is a "big region" that the SAR must tap into, while Central Asia is another area of interest, if time permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finding time to cover that wide range of visits is a big challenge as well. There will be some division of labour… among government officials, and also… between the government and private sectors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In respect of raising the reputation and telling the good Hong Kong story to different countries, the private sector, of course, plays an important role as well, because they have their own network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have also, through their network, built up strong links with different opinion leaders as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee vowed to continue seeking support for Hong Kong's accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, as around 70 percent of the city's trade is conducted with economies under the pact.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell slightly overnight after Nvidia shares dropped for a second day, dragging down the technology sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Technology was the biggest loser among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, weighed by Nvidia, while communication services led the gain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's Nvidia's game, and the rest of us are just pretending to be here,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management in Philadelphia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically all the activity is now concentrated in Nvidia call options," he added. "Seven million option contracts Nvidia have traded. That's something in the neighborhood of three or four times the quantity of contract volume that would have traded for the market in total five years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose a tenth of a percent, to 39,162. The S&P 500 lost a fifth of a percent, to end at 5,468, while the Nasdaq lost a fifth of a percent, to 17,693.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of megacaps Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple rose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We've had a very strong run, especially in the S&P over the last couple weeks. So not surprised to see things kind of take a pause and settle down,” Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's trading could be more volatile than usual due to triple witching, the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index options, and stock index futures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  U.S. business activity reached a 26-month high in June amid a rebound in employment, while easing price pressures suggested the recent inflation slowdown may continue. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Austria claimed a convincing 3-1 win over Poland in Berlin on Friday to take a step towards the Euro 2024 knock-out rounds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Robert Lewandowski returned from a thigh injury as a substitute for Poland, now on the brink of elimination from Group D after two defeats, but could not help his team make inroads against Ralf Rangnick's sturdy side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland striker Krzysztof Piatek levelled Gernot Trauner's opener, but Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic's second-half goals earned Austria three vital points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria dominated the opening stages and Trauner powered home a header at the near post from the enterprising Phillipp Mwene's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piatek levelled for Poland after half an hour, staying calm in the box when a rebound fell his way and slotting into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the game level approaching the hour mark, Poland coach Michal Probierz sent on Lewandowski, who took the captain's armband.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Showing little concern about his injury, the forward charged around and quickly picked up a booking for catching Philipp Lienhart with his arm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria regained the lead after 67 minutes when Arnautovic cleverly stepped over a pass received by Baumgartner, who stroked into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Baumgartner celebrated wildly with Rangnick and gave the former interim Manchester United coach credit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He supports me every day and gave me a lot of strength at half-time," explained the midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He talked to me for three or four minutes, so the thanks went to him too."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran captain Arnautovic, 35, sealed the win with a late penalty after Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny felled Marcel Sabitzer. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia remain underdogs in Euro 2024 and are determined to make a good run in the tournament, coach Francesco Calzona said on Friday, hailing a crop of players who performed well even in defeat against a determined Ukraine side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovakia started the Group E match strongly with a succession of chances leading to Ivan Schranz netting his second goal of the championship in the 17th minute, but a resolute Ukraine fought back to level the score after the break and stunned the Slovakians with another 10 minutes from time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia came into the match with 10 wins from the last 14 games, including their shock 1-0 victory over Belgium on Monday, and needed just one more to advance early to the next round of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had the opportunity but we knew that we were coming up against a team that had to win at all costs to stay in the hunt to make it through to the knockout stage," Italian Calzona said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us we are the Cinderella story of the group stage so the fact that we're already here and competing to make it through to the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team try and play football against anyone regardless of the opposition and I'm very proud of that fact," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defeat for Slovakia will be a reminder of their last Euros, when their opening victory was followed by two defeats, including a 5-0 drubbing by Spain, and an early exit from the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calzona said the loss to Ukraine was all about the strength of a team that was desperate to make amends for their 3-0 trouncing by Romania, Slovakia's next opponents. Romania play Belgium on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we led this evening there was still a long way to go. We played very strong opposition, we know that. I am happy with my team's performance, we produced a great display, I'm very proud of my lads," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few months ago it would have been inconceivable that our team could play against these strong sides." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France missed Kylian Mbappe in a wasteful display against the Netherlands but keeping their main man on the bench rather than risk him so soon after a broken nose may prove clever if he returns to help Les Bleus go deep into Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mbappe, who had run riot against the Dutch in the past with six goals in five games, was ready to come on with a mask.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he remained an unused substitute in the tournament's first 0-0 draw - a disappointing spectacle given the two sides' pedigree but a result that leaves both on four points and virtually through to the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the absence of Mbappe, 33-year-old Antoine Griezmann took the captain's armband and also occupied his attacking space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he failed to convert a stream of chances, twice getting the ball caught under his feet when right in front of goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France enjoyed 58% possession, completed 614 passes to the Netherlands' 353, and had double the number of goal attempts at 16. But coach Didier Deschamps may not worry too much about the team's profligacy, given their control of large periods of the game and the likelihood of Mbappe's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether the forward is rested for the last group game against Poland remains to be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he is back on the pitch, Mbappe, 25, will have a point to prove: he has never scored at a Euros tournament and in 2021 his penalty was saved in a shootout with Switzerland which saw France exit at the last 16 stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, he has 12 goals at World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Griezmann missed a header, several shots and those couple of bundled close-range opportunities, Marcus Thuram also fluffed his chances and veteran Olivier Giroud made little impact when he came on in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France looked lethargic at times, despite dominating possession, and were perhaps lucky to come across a Dutch side lacking any real threat up front to match the quality of their Virgil van Dijk-marshalled defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands were dismayed, however, when Xavi Simons thought he had scored, only to see the goal disallowed because Denzel Dumfries was deemed to be interfering with play as he stood offside next to goalkeeper Mike Maignan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At times, it almost looked like both sides were happy to settle for a draw, trusting that four points would be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With already-eliminated Poland to come next for France, while the Dutch have a trickier task against Austria, Didier Deschamps' side look the likelier of the two heavyweights to top Group D and ensure a better draw in the knockout stage. (Reuters)

    Chris Tang accuses RFA of endangering security

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang on Friday accused Radio Free Asia (RFA) of endangering national security by spreading misleading and false information in its report on the renewal of smart ID cards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news agency published an article accusing the government of "threatening" overseas Hongkongers, saying they could face jail if they didn't return to Hong Kong to renew their cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the government said the station was confusing different laws - and those who don't renew on time will only be fined HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said whether charges would be brought against the station would depend on the evidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At first, I didn't understand why the outlet left Hong Kong [after Article 23]. Now I know why. It's because the relevant ordinance targets those endangering national security and the security of Hong Kong," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But you see, what this outlet does from afar is that it uses inaccurate information, and comes up with ways to incite the people to distrust or hate the government. These are exactly the sort of potentially illegal activities that we target in safeguarding national security."

<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union countries on Friday formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova next week, another step in the two nations' long journey to join the 27-nation bloc.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Belgium, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, said member states have agreed on a negotiating framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This opens the way for launching the negotiations on Tuesday 25 June in Luxembourg,” the Belgian presidency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a positive assessment from the bloc’s executive branch, EU leaders had already agreed last year that accession negotiations should start with both countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The process between the start of negotiations with Ukraine and its neighbour Moldova and their becoming EU member states could take many years. (AP)

    Armenia recognises Palestinian state

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Armenia has officially recognised a Palestinian state, the Armenian foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, the latest country to do so despite opposition from Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's foreign ministry said it summoned Armenia's ambassador to Israel after the former Soviet republic declared its recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following Armenia's recognition of a Palestinian state, the foreign ministry summoned the Armenian ambassador in Israel for a severe reprimand," it said in a statement shortly after Armenia's announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia supports a United Nations resolution on an immediate ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and is in favour of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the same statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, welcomed Armenia’s decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This recognition contributes positively to preserving the two-state solution, which faces systematic challenges, and promotes security, peace, and stability for all parties involved," the Authority's presidency said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain, Ireland and Norway were among several Western countries to officially recognise a Palestinian state, prompting Israel to pull its ambassadors from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo last month. (Agencies)

    Deloitte lowers Hong Kong's IPO forecast by 40 percent

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Edward Au (centre) says more mainland companies would list in Hong Kong after the US Federal Reserve cuts its interest rates. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758466_1_20240621170819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Accounting firm Deloitte on Friday said it had slashed its projections for Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) fundraising by up to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deloitte now expects to see 80 new listings to generate between HK$60 billion and HK$80 billion of proceeds, down from its previous estimate of HK$100 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southern Region Managing Partner of Deloitte China, Edward Au, attributed the downgrade in expectations to the uncertainty surrounding the US interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut timing will affect the flow of funds into Hong Kong, because I think definitely investors would wait, regarding the risk and return,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They actually want to invest in more tangible [assets], and companies with concrete profits or paths to profit.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the lowering of Deloitte's forecast, Au expected that Hong Kong would be among the top five global IPO venues in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ultimately, Au was optimistic that more mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the second half of the year, as their valuations would rise if the US Federal Reserve reduced its rates, as some have projected, resulting in an appreciation of the renminbi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another accountancy giant, KPMG, which released its revised projections on Tuesday, expected that IPO fundraising in Hong Kong would generate at most HK$60 billion in revenue in 2024.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in May year-on-year, up slightly from the 1.1 percent increase recorded in April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Census and Statistics Department figures released on Friday showed there was a 20.1 percent increase in the price of alcoholic drinks and tobacco, a 3 percent rise in the price of meals out and takeaways, and a 2.3 percent increase in transport costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said inflation should remain contained in the near future, but domestic cost pressures may increase as the local economy continues to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "External price pressures should continue to stay on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties. The government will continue to monitor the situation," the spokesperson said.
