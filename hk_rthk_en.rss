<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the three-month period ending in June, according to revised figures released by the government on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth followed a 2.7 percent increase in GDP in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, government economist Adolph Leung said he expects the economy to continue to expand, driven by strong export demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year. Exports of goods should sustain a positive performance if external demand holds up, though trade conflicts would present risks,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said the government has kept its growth projection for the year unchanged at a range of between 3.5 and 5.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the government has downgraded the projected inflation rate from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent for the year.

    China backs Myanmar's democratic transition: Wang Yi

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi shakes hand with Eksiri Pintaruchi, Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Thailand, during the 9th Mekong-Lancang Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Chiang Mai. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766452_1_20240816163414.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China supports a plan by Myanmar's military government to hold fresh elections and return the country to a "democratic transition".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Thailand to attend a regional meeting, Wang said that China also supports a peace plan agreed to by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), known as its five-point "consensus".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We support Myanmar in achieving domestic political reconciliation within the framework of its constitution... and restarting the process of democratic transition through elections," the foreign minister said at the meeting in Chiang Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country has been in turmoil ever since the military deposed the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coup upended a 10-year experiment with democracy and a subsequent military crackdown has sparked fighting with established ethnic minority armed groups and newer pro-democracy "People's Defence Forces".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is an ally of the military government, but analysts say it also maintains ties with ethnic groups fighting the military in Myanmar's northern Shan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar's government has promised to hold fresh elections but has repeatedly delayed a timetable for polls as it struggles to crush opposition to its coup across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week Wang met military chief Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw and "discussed and exchanged views openly regarding free and fair multi-party general elections".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar is deeply divided by conflict, with civilians caught up in near-daily bomb blasts, targeted killings and clashes between the military and opponents of its coup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has acknowledged it does not fully control swathes of the country and in February activated a long-dormant conscription law to replenish its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has said it will hold polls next year after conducting a nationwide census. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

    Thaksin's daughter becomes new Thai PM

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Thai lawmakers on Friday elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra as the kingdom's new prime minister. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766441_1_20240816132529.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paetongtarn Shinawatra won the backing of parliament to become Thailand's youngest prime minister on Friday, only a day after she was thrust into the spotlight amid an unrelenting power struggle between the warring elites.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old daughter of divisive political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra won easily with 319 votes, or nearly two-thirds of the house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was not present in parliament and watched the vote from her Pheu Thai Party's headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn now faces a baptism of fire, just two days after ally Srettha Thavisin was dismissed as premier by a judiciary central to Thailand's two decades of intermittent turmoil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At stake could be the legacy and political future of the billionaire Shinawatra family, whose once unstoppable populist juggernaut suffered its first election defeat in over two decades last year, and had to do a deal with its bitter enemies in the military to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn will immediately face challenges on multiple fronts, with the economy floundering and the popularity of her Pheu Thai Party dwindling, having yet to deliver on its flagship cash handout programme worth 500 billion baht.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn has never served in government and will become Thailand's second female prime minister and the third Shinawatra to take the top job after aunt Yingluck Shinawatra, and 75-year-old father Thaksin, the country's most influential and polarising politician. (Reuters)

    China to screen arrivals for mpox symptoms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China announced on Friday it would begin screening people and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, just two days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global health emergency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People travelling from countries where virus outbreaks have occurred, who have been in contact with mpox cases or display symptoms, should "take the initiative to declare to customs when entering the country", China's customs administration said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vehicles, containers and items from areas with mpox cases should also be sanitised, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden on Thursday announced the first case outside Africa of a more dangerous variant of mpox, with the WHO warning that further imported cases of this new strain in Europe was likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO on Wednesday had sounded its highest possible alarm over the worsening mpox situation in Africa, calling it a global public health emergency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just a day before, the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the intensifying outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox has swept through the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970, and spread to other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals, but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions. (AFP)

    'Raygun' hits back at critics of her Olympic routine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael Gunn said the backlash to her much-ridiculed Olympic performance has been “devastating,” adding she took the competition seriously and gave her best effort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old b-girl, known as "Raygun", said in a video posted to social media that she wasn’t prepared for the level of negative attention she has received since judges awarded her zero points in her Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) criticised an anonymous online petition attacking the Paris Games competitor, saying it was “vexatious, misleading and bullying.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympic debut in Paris, and one of the lasting images was the performance of Gunn, a 36-year-old university professor from Sydney — who did a “kangaroo dance” among other questionable moves during her routine — and did not receive a single point from any of the nine judges in either round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn was subsequently mocked for her efforts, including a parody on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in the United States. In the video, she said she was subjected to abuse that went beyond criticism of her dance moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’d really like to ask the press to please stop harassing my family, my friends, the Australian breaking community and the broader street dance community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn, who has not yet returned to Australia, received strong support from Australian Olympic team leader Anna Meares while in Paris. On Thursday, the AOC went a step further, taking aim at what it called erroneous material published online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief executive officer Matt Carroll said the the AOC had written to Change.org, which had published a petition criticising Gunn and the AOC, demanding that it be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 people had signed the petition claiming Gunn had “manipulated” Olympic qualification processes. The petition appeared to have been removed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carroll said the petition “contained numerous falsehoods designed to engender hatred against an athlete who was selected in the Australian Olympic team through a transparent and independent qualification event and nomination process.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking at the Olympics might have been one-and-done in Paris. The sport is not on the competition list for Los Angeles in 2028, and also is unlikely to appear in 2032 at Brisbane, Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online criticism of Gunn this past week has included suggestions the Oceania qualifying event held in Sydney last October was set up to favour her, and questioned the judging that allowed Gunn to qualify .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AOC said Thursday the Oceania qualifying event was conducted under the Olympic qualification system determined by the international governing body, the World DanceSport Federation, and approved by International Olympic Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unattributed social media comments also suggested Gunn and her husband, fellow breaker Samuel Free, had held positions within Australian breaking organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Rachael Gunn holds no position with AUSBreaking or DanceSport Australia in any capacity,” the AOC said Thursday. “She is simply an athlete who competed in the qualifying event which she won.” (AP)

 Immigration officials on Friday said they had arrested three people on suspicion of working illegally in the SAR as photographers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department said it believes the trio – a man and two women – had advertised wedding and street photography services on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they pretended to be customers and arrested the three suspects after they entered Hong Kong from the mainland as tourists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea broke a century-old weather record with the 26th so-called tropical night in a row -- when the temperature stays above 25 degrees Celsius, according to official data released Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Much of the world is enduring a summer of extreme heat, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning last month of an "extreme heat epidemic", and calling for action to limit the impact of heatwaves intensified by climate change.

  Overnight temperatures in the South Korean capital Seoul have sizzled above 25 degrees Celsius for 26 days in a row, officials said, marking the longest streak since modern weather observation began in 1907.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record ties a streak set in 2018, but the weather agency counts the most recent as the benchmark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The intense heat in Seoul is expected to continue, according to Seoul's Office of Metrology, setting a new record every day until next week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck 34 kilometres off Taiwan's eastern city of Hualien on Friday, with no immediate reports of damage from what was the second strong tremor to hit the island in less than a day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The quake also shook buildings in Taipei. Authorities said subway services in the city continued at lower speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quake had a depth of 9.7 kilometres, the weather administration said, and followed a 5.7 magnitude earthquake that struck off Taiwan's northeastern shore on late Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather officials have warned of the risk of landslides in mountainous areas following days of rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, Hualien was hit by the biggest earthquake to affect the island in at least 25 years. Nine people were killed and more than 900 injured. (Reuters)

    Make HK a hard liquor trading centre, says lawmaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB's Kennedy Wong said if Hong Kong didn't lower or scrap hard liquor duty, it would lose out to Hainan Island and Macau. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766395_1_20240816093031.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong says Hong Kong should scrap its 100 percent levy on strong alcohol so it can match the wine industry and become an international trading centre for hard liquor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Wong said the wine trade had boomed since duty was scrapped in 2008 and revenue from sales of alcohol with a strength of over 30 percent was only HK$700 million. He also said Hong Kong needs to compete with Hainan, which will be tax free by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look at this issue from a trade perspective. If we don't lower or scrap the duty we are already losing out to Macau and the surrounding areas and at the end of this year, when Hainan turns into a free trade zone, a lot of the whisky, brandy promotions - because they are all aimed at the mainland China market - they'll all move to Hainan. Hard liquor from mainland China, like the Moutai, the Wuliangyee, they won't use Hong Kong to tap the international market, they might as well use Hainan," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong had the highest liquor duty in the region with Macau only charging 10 percent. He said Hong Kong also charged more than Taiwan and Japan, although the duty here was about the same as South Korea. He said Hainan, which caters mainly to the mainland domestic tourist market, had been declared a tax free area by the State Council in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said if Hong Kong followed the same route as the wine trade here, it could be an attractive place for companies wanting to sell top-of-the range hard liquor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You scrapped the duty so a lot of aged or vintage wine moved to Hong Kong and because Hong Kong also had first-class storage facilities - and because of our close proximity to the mainland China market, which is a big, big market you know for the wine industry - a lot of wine merchants created off-shoots here including a lot of French vineyards, chateaux that I know," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think likewise for liquor: for vodka, for whisky, for brandy, for the Moutai and so on. If they all create more trading companies here and then they are willing to move some of their vintage - the nice liquor - to Hong Kong, then Hong Kong will gradually climb back to the top of the world in this particular field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month the DAB called on the Chief Executive John Lee to scrap the duty on hard liquor as part of its proposals for Lee's upcoming policy address.

 Hungary's Blanka Vas won the fifth stage of the Tour de France Femmes on Thursday with Dutch teammate Demi Vollering losing the race lead after being caught up in a big crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma finished second to take the leader's yellow jersey from defending champion Vollering who dropped to ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pile-up with six kilometres to go involving 10 riders including Vollering decimated the peloton in the run to Amneville in northeastern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Team SD Worx leader now trails 1min 19sec behind her main rival Niewiadoma, who had started the stage 34 seconds behind Vollering. (AFP)

    Pochettino to become new US national team coach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly agreed terms to become the new coach of the United States national team, according to multiple reports on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Athletic and ESPN reported that unnamed sources confirmed Pochettino, who parted ways with English Premier League side Chelsea in May, would replace Gregg Berhalter as boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino, 52, would arrive as the United States prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino left Chelsea after finishing sixth in the Premier League in his only season in charge, after previous stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports said the deal was struck after multiple conversations with US Soccer Federation technical director Matt Crocker, and that no contract has been signed nor has the federation's board of directors agreed a deal with Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentinian cannot sign a contract with US Soccer until a pay situation with Chelsea is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino would be expected to take over the US squad in time for a friendly against Canada on September 7 at Kansas City. (AFP)

    Gauff crashes out in WTA Cincinnati opener

<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-ranked defending champion Coco Gauff crashed out in her opening match at the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Open, falling to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The second-round shock to America's Paris Olympic flag-bearer stunned a partisan crowd in the US heartland in the final major tuneup for the US Open on August 26, where Gauff is defending champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva, ranked 34th, has made a recent habit of upsets, knocking off world number one Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon third round barely a month ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really proud of myself," said Putintseva. "Even if the crowd was cheering for Coco, they were fair with me. "These courts are so fast, you have to just play on instinct. That's what I did."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff became the youngest winner at Cincinnati a year ago at age 19 and carried that success into her first Grand Slam triumph at the US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva will next face Spain's Paula Badosa, who defeated Anna Kalinsyaka 6-3, 6-2. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 2 percent after July US retail sales data signaled resilient consumer spending, allaying fears of an imminent recession in the world's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Retail sales increased 1.0 percent after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent drop in June, easing fears of a sharp economic slowdown fanned by a jump in the unemployment rate last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail bellwether Walmart rose 6.58 percent after raising its annual profit forecast for the second time this year as Americans flocked to its stores for inexpensive essentials. Rivals Target and Costco also advanced 4.35 percent and 1.69 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate reading also showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wall of worry is beginning to crumble as sentiment is improving and the fundamentals support a risk-on bias," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. "Retail sales were above expectations, Consumer Price Index numbers came in at a tolerable level, so the fundamental backdrop is consistent with rising equity prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors have cautiously eyed this week's economic data releases, the last set before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivers a much-awaited speech at Jackson Hole next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39 percent, to 40,563. The S&P 500 gained 1.61 percent, at 5,543. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.34 percent, to 17,595.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other movers, Cisco Systems rose 6.8 percent after it forecast better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and said it was cutting 7 percent of its global workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike climbed 5.07 percent as billionaire investor William Ackman built new stakes in the sportswear company. Ulta Beauty jumped 11.17 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a stake in the cosmetics store chain. (Reuters)

    Biden says he "beat Big Pharma" with drug price deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has negotiated down the prices of 10 top-selling prescription drugs used by Medicare by as much as 79 percent, hoping to save US$6 billion in the first year as part of a plan hailed on Thursday by President Joe Biden with the aim to ease anger about high prices ahead of November elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, was the first to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most costly drugs that the programme covers for 66 million people. The new prices will go into effect in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We finally beat Big Pharma," Biden said at an event in Largo, Maryland, alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration hopes the savings will ease Americans' anger about high prices, an issue they frequently say is their top concern headed into the closely contested November 5 presidential election between Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs," Harris said. "Medicare can use that (collective bargaining) power to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new prices represent cuts to individual list prices that do not reflect any rebates and discounts the government may already be getting for the drugs, although the government's estimated savings from the negotiations do take those discounts into account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' tie-breaking Senate vote passed the law that allows for the drug-price negotiations, which no Republicans supported. In a statement, she also pointed to her work as California attorney general holding "big pharma accountable for their deceptive and illegal practices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said people covered by Medicare, which mostly serves Americans aged 65 and over, would also save US$1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs for the prescription medicines in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merck & Co's diabetes drug Januvia faces the steepest percentage price cut of the drugs on the list, decreasing 79 percent, while Novo Nordisk's insulin aspart products will face the second steepest of 76 percent, according to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other eight drugs on the list face cuts of between 68 percent and 38 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drugmakers voiced their opposition to the new discounts that they said would not necessarily lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and could hinder future innovation. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden confirmed its first case of the viral infection mpox on Thursday, which was also the first case outside Africa, a day after the WHO declared the disease a global public health emergency for the second time in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The person was infected while staying in a part of Africa where there was a large outbreak of the disease, Olivia Wigzell, director-general at the Swedish Public Health Agency, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation made its announcement over mpox, which spreads through close contact, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries of a more serious type of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I," Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed told the press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigzell said the person who was infected had received care and instructions in line with the health agency's recommendations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The case is the first caused by Clade I that has been diagnosed outside the African continent. The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade I," she said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Criminal charges have been filed against five people in connection with the death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry nearly a year ago, law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defendants include two doctors and an assistant to Perry who were part of "a broad underground criminal network" that distributed large quantities of the prescription drug ketamine to the actor and others, US Attorney Martin Estrada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These defendants took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves," Estrada said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry died at age 54 from "acute effects" of ketamine, a powerful sedative, in addition to other factors that caused the actor to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub last October, an autopsy said. For months, Los Angeles homicide detectives and federal agents have been investigating how Perry obtained the prescription drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A December 2023 autopsy report concluded Perry died from the "acute effects of ketamine," which combined with other factors caused the actor to lose consciousness and slip below the water in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toxicology tests found Perry's body contained dangerously high levels of ketamine, a short-acting anaesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Typically, people with that much ketamine in their systems are in general aesthesia during surgery, and being monitored by professionals, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other contributing factors in his death were drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of the opioid-addiction medicine buprenorphine, which was also detected in his system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of drug and alcohol abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends." He had been sober for 19 months with no known relapses before his death, according to interviews cited in his autopsy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witness interviews in the autopsy report said he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, so the ketamine found in his system by medical examiners would have been introduced since that last infusion, the autopsy said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda pair of Ying Ying and Le Le have finally produced babies, after they successfully mated in March this year at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After five months of pregnancy, Ying Ying gave birth to one female and one male in the small hours of Thursday. Ocean Park, where the giant panda lives, said she spent much of her time lying on the ground and twisting, and that she was in labour for more than five hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ocean Park Hong Kong is thrilled to welcome the birth of the first-ever giant panda twins in Hong Kong," the amusement park said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This birth is a true rarity, especially considering Ying Ying is the oldest giant panda on record to have successfully given birth for the first time," the park said, adding that she gave birth just one day before her 19th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilise, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth. Currently, both babies are under 24-hour intensive care by the park’s animal care and veterinary team, as well as experts from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee called the birth of the panda twins a very special occasion, and thanked the nation for having gifted Ying Ying and Le Le to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Ocean Park's team for taking good care of the city's giant pandas and experts from the research centre for their support.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested the driver of a tram involved in a fatal crash that killed a three-year-old girl in Western District on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tram was travelling along the eastbound track of Praya, Kennedy Town at 10.40am, officers said. But when it approached the pedestrian crossing near Des Voeux Road West, it reportedly knocked down four people who were crossing the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year-old girl was trapped under the tram and was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital in an unconscious state. She was certified dead at about 12.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A six-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man also sustained injuries and were sent to the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 48-year-old male driver on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and that he is currently being detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For their part, Hong Kong Tramways said that according to their preliminary understanding, the tram was operating as usual when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that they suspended the driver after the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it is very concerned about the incident and that it has asked the tramway operator to investigate it in detail and submit a report as soon as possible.

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s populist Pheu Thai party on Thursday nominated its party chief, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, in a Parliament vote for the country’s new leader after former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was removed by a court order over an ethical violation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn said she was ready to work for the country to move it forward and promised give her best, after securing her candidacy for prime minister by the governing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined, together and will push the country forward," she told a press conference ahead of Friday's parliamentary vote on a new premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is seen as force behind Pheu Thai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the first Thai politician ever to win an overall majority of seats. The residual popularity of Thaksin is a factor in the support for Paetongtarn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Paetongtarn is approved by Parliament's vote she would become Thailand’s second female prime minister, and the country’s third leader from the Shinwatra family after her father and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population fell by 0.1 percent between mid-2023 and the middle of 2024, according to government estimates released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures by the Census and Statistics Department showed that the SAR's population slid from 7,536,100 in mid-2023, to 7,531,800 in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the territory saw a net outflow of 30,200 residents, but 44,000 one-way permit holders came to the SAR, resulting in a net inflow of 13,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the population saw a small increase in the first half of 2024 due to the introduction of various government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Benefiting from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation, there was sizeable inflow of persons from the mainland and other places around the world to Hong Kong in the first half of 2024," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Yip, a population expert from the University of Hong Kong, said authorities had to work on retaining talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to make the people who decided to come to Hong Kong, stay in Hong Kong...I think we also have to diversify our portfolio. Not only from mainland China, we also like to attract, some foreign talent from other places too," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to make Hong Kong to be a truly cosmopolitan city, I think we do need talent to come from different places, [like] the Belt and Road countries and also Europe or the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures showed that Hong Kong saw 34,400 births last year, a five percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies, along with other proposals to promote births, was announced in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said the policies announced last October might not be reflected in the official data yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be very interesting to see whether there would be any substantial increase in 2024. But I think even if there is any impact, it will be quite limited," he said.

    Bargain hunters snap up deals at Food Expo

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's largest food festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Thursday, with enthusiastic bargain hunters racing inside as the doors opened at 10am sharp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some of the visitors to Food Expo said they had queued up overnight just to snap up bargains or freebies, such as ready-to-eat abalone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were looking to rediscover old favourites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We bought some Taiwanese rice flour noodles, because we went to Taiwan before so I just want my kids to try again," said a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourists were also at the exhibition centre to sample new flavours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just got some coffee and some coffee beans. I'm from Australia so we really like coffee over there. I've got some peanut chocolate butter as well, that's really nice. Hadn't seen that before," Andrew Frank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully the customs doesn't take it away from me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vendors, on the other hand, seized the chance to learn about the preferences of local customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Illugi Gunnarsson, who distributes Icelandic farm products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very good opportunity for us to meet people from Hong Kong, really see how they react to our products. But it also gives us an opportunity to sell, of course we like that, but mainly to understand our customers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau, meanwhile, underlined the contribution the convention and exhibition industry makes to the SAR's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The convention and exhibition industry has always been crucial to Hong Kong's economy by attracting high-spending overnight business visitors to Hong Kong, spurring economic activities and creating employment opportunities," Yau remarked at an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am glad to know that this week's fairs have gathered over 1,800 high-quality exhibitors from 28 countries and regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expo will take place until Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan lifted on Thursday a week-old warning that a "megaquake", potentially causing colossal damage and loss of life could strike, with the government telling people their lives could now "go back to normal".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alert that such a catastrophe might hit the archipelago of 125 million people prompted thousands of Japanese to cancel holidays and stock up on essentials, emptying shelves in some stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there were no abnormalities detected in seismic activity and crustal deformation, the special call for attention ended at 5pm," disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it doesn't mean the risk [of a major earthquake] has been eliminated," Matsumura told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been asking for special precautions, such as sleeping while being prepared to evacuate immediately. But we will no longer ask for these steps, and the people of Japan are free to go back to normal lifestyles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Thursday, Japan's weather agency said the likelihood of a megaquake was "higher than normal" following a magnitude 7.1 jolt earlier in the day that injured 15 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a particular kind of tremor known as a subduction megathrust quake, which in the past has occurred in pairs and can unleash massive tsunamis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advisory concerned the Nankai Trough between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 800-kilometre undersea gully runs parallel to Japan's Pacific coast, including off the Tokyo region, the world's biggest urban area and home to around 40 million people. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Thursday said it recorded about four million visitor arrivals in July, with about half involving overnight stays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure was a 10 percent increase on the same month last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 80 percent of July's visitors came from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said Hong Kong received about 25 million visitors in the first seven months of this year, over 50 percent more than the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the city held several events, including drone shows and pyrotechnic displays, adding that a survey of tourists found more than 90 percent believed the drone shows had enhanced their visit experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said it will organise drone shows and pyrotechnic displays during Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas and New Year's Eve, and will stage a new year countdown fireworks performance.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association on Thursday said it welcomed a possible relaxation of the eligibility criteria for a talent attraction programme, saying it would draw more professionals to the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the moment, graduates of the world's top 100 universities are eligible to move to the SAR under the scheme. On Monday, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government is considering expanding the list of universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who founded the association, said at a press briefing that an expansion would boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This plan would give more support to Hong Kong's economy, and provide more and more entrepreneurs coming to Hong Kong and make more startups in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang also urged the government to offer more support to the children of professionals arriving in Hong Kong through the programme, saying they might encounter challenges when adapting to a new educational environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called on employers to provide housing allowances to incoming professionals due to accommodation costs in the city.

    NGOs urged to spend more on cybersecurity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Francis Fong says NGOs should treat cybersecurity as a recurring expense. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766262_1_20240815122329.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An IT expert on Thursday urged NGOs, schools, and hospitals to prioritise cybersecurity spending, warning they are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This advice came after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data estimated that roughly 470,000 people's personal data was stolen in a cyberattack against Oxfam Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, the honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation and an Oxfam council member, told RTHK the council had instructed team members to notify all affected individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong explained that a key reason NGOs were prone to attacks was because of widespread work-from-home practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the pandemic because we used to work from home...We normally use a VPN to get into the office server so you can work remotely. But the problem is if you have not updated the firmware of the firewall, the VPN, the OS of the workstation server, even your antivirus or your security software, there are possibly many loopholes the hackers can attack the network and get the data from the server.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said staff awareness was lacking, noting many attacks were caused by employees tapping on suspicious web links or phishing emails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong pointed to the need for a shift in organisations’ mindsets over cybersecurity spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the past, we all thought this was just like one-off expense for security measures, but now because of so many attacks, these expenses [should] become like a regular expense, at least like a yearly expense,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So you should actually update all your servers. You have to buy subscriptions of your firewall and your security software, so that you are being properly protected, and you have to do security audits at least once a year.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments on Thursday signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in areas such as conservation and pollution control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pact was signed during a ceremony at the University of Hong Kong to mark National Ecology Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement is also aimed at stepping up joint efforts to combat climate change, ecological promotion and education, as well as preserving biodiversity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said the SAR government has always tried its best to preserve nature, as part of efforts to build a beautiful China and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always stressed the need for people to co-exist with nature and adheres to President Xi Jinping's philosophy that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively setting up the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, which would be five times larger than the current wetland park. This would enhance the biodiversity and quality of the natural habitat in the Deep Bay area," Cheuk said in a speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also enhances the environmental capacity of the Northern Metropolis and achieves the co-existence of development and conservation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that over the next fortnight, the administration will team up with dozens of non-governmental organisations to hold a number of activities encouraging conservation, including free ecological tours and free admission to facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Shenzhen top official on natural resources, Xu Songming, said the pact between the two governments will allow a new level of mutual governance and sharing on ecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Shenzhen has always learned from Hong Kong's good example in terms of environmental protection, calling the SAR "the world's model city" for its green and low carbon developments.

    China retail sales improve, but factory output slows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's factory output growth slowed and missed expectations in July, but consumption figures were better than expected for that period. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766264_1_20240815122932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales rebounded in July while industrial production growth slowed, official data showed Thursday, highlighting an uneven recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Industrial output grew 5.1 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, slowing from the 5.3 percent pace in June and below expectations for a 5.2 percent increase in a Reuters poll of analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the NBS' monthly activity indicators showed retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.7 percent in July, quickening from a two percent increase in June and beating expectations for growth of 2.6 percent, a sign efforts to boost household spending were getting some traction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the jobs front, China's labour market remained stable in the January-July period as the surveyed urban unemployment rate dropped on a year-on-year basis, according to NBS data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average of surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first seven months of 2024, down 0.2 percentage points from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July alone, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, up from five percent in June but still lower than 5.3 percent a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts warn the broader outlook remained challenging for policymakers, suggesting more stimulus measures will be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data shows that the economy has gotten off to a weak start in the second half of the year, and it is expected that the probability of replacing MLF with a RRR cut will increase, but key to maintaining five percent economic growth remains the arrival of fiscal spending," said ANZ China market economist Xing Zhaopeng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was referring to the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending facility and reserve requirement ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the central bank injected cash through a short-term bond instrument and said it would conduct an MLF rollover later this month as it extends liquidity support to the financial system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's central bank at a meeting earlier this month said it would step up financial support to the broader economy and efforts would be directed more at consumers to spur consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with domestic demand weak and the outlook unclear, households and businesses are in no rush to borrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for more growth boosting measures have dogged officials ever since a widely expected post-pandemic recovery failed to materialise in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded 3.6 percent in the first seven months of 2024 year-on-year, but also missed expectations for a 3.9 percent rise and also slowed from the 3.9 percent growth in the January to June period. (Agencies and Xinhua)

  <br/>
  They said they found 33 cats and one dog inside the unit, with five of the felines in poor health and one already dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The animals were taken away for further examination and care.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman is currently in custody.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned, coming nearly four months after the Ivy League university was rocked by campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the prestigious New York college grapple with protests over the Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions related to the conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anti-war protests and encampments at Columbia and campuses across the United States were a flashpoint in debates about US support for Israel in its campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics said the protests at Columbia and elsewhere veered into anti-Semitism and intimidation, culminating in Shafik being questioned before the US Congress along with other university presidents and accused of not keeping Jewish students safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters -- many of whom were themselves Jewish -- said demonstrators' anti-Israel views were being conflated with anti-Semitism. They also said that individual allegations of hate incidents were being used to distract from calls for a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead," Shafik wrote in an email announcing the move, according to student newspaper the Columbia Spectator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am making this announcement now so that new leadership can be in place before the new term begins."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests and encampments spread across US universities, protesters at times occupied buildings. In some cases there were clashes with police, while at other times pro-Israel protesters attacked the encampments. (Agencies)

 Rookie road rider Puck Pieterse clung on to win stage four of the Tour de France Femmes in Liege on Wednesday, with compatriot Demi Vollering taking second in a photo finish to conserve the yellow jersey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first-ever road race victory for the 22-year-old cross-discipline star Pieterse at her first Tour de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result lifted the Dutch rider to second overall, and gave her the best young rider's white jersey and the polka dot climb jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To take the win here, in a sprint ahead of Demi, it's really a dream coming true," said Pieterse. "They were riding for the general classification. I'm just here for the stage. I'm fresh. I just tried to keep a poker face and take it from the sprint."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering, meanwhile, held onto the leader's yellow jersey she pulled on after Tuesday's time-trial in Rotterdam. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé enjoyed a "great night" as he struck on his Real Madrid debut to help his new side claim a record sixth Uefa Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Atalanta on Wednesday in Warsaw.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The superstar French forward has waited years to play for his dream club and after finally signing for Los Blancos this summer at the end of his Paris Saint-Germain deal, celebrated his first appearance with a goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fede Valverde broke the deadlock from close range for the Champions League holders in the 59th minute after the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid began to rack up the chances and Mbappé rifled home in the 68th minute after Jude Bellingham spotted his dart into space in the box to seal the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great night, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, to play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans," Mbappé said, speaking in fluent Spanish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's triumph ensured coach Carlo Ancelotti equalled former Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz on a joint-record 14 titles won at the helm of the club.

    Lower inflation boosts Wall Street

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street enjoyed a positive session. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766213_1_20240815051807.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 ended higher on Wednesday, stretching its winning streak to five sessions, as the latest inflation data reassured investors betting the Federal Reserve would start cutting US interest rates next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also posted its fifth straight daily gain, although it barely scraped into positive territory as Alphabet and some megacap tech stocks weighed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moves were generally subdued with many investors away for August vacations, and new triggers for trading were absent, contributing to an overall listless picture among the benchmarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest US consumer price data, released earlier on Wednesday, reinforced expectations that the Fed would start interest rate cuts in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumer prices rose moderately in July, and the annual increase in inflation slowed to below 3 percent for the first time since early 2021. A day earlier, softer-than-expected producer prices data indicated inflation continued to moderate, although not yet all the way to the US central bank's 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments, said he called days such as this "markets violently going nowhere", adding with CPI painting a similar picture to PPI data, there was no reason for traders to reassess moves put in place on the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no huge rationale to move prices one way or another," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 closed at 5,455, up 0.38 percent. The Nasdaq Composite closed at 17,193, up 0.03 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.61 percent at 40,008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Alphabet, the Google-parent, dropped 2.3 percent on a media report that the US Department of Justice is considering options that include breaking up the online search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other megacaps were mixed: Tesla slumped 3.1 percent and Meta Platforms dropped 0.3 percent, while Microsoft fell 0.7 percent and Nvidia declined 1.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rebound in megacap and tech stocks has helped markets recoup most losses from a global market rout early this month after data showed the U.S. unemployment rate surged in July. (Reuters)

    Mars swallows Pringles maker in US$36bn deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pringles will now be part of a snack empire that also includes Mars products. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766209_1_20240815034438.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family-owned candy giant Mars is buying Cheez-It maker Kellanova in a nearly US$36 billion deal, bringing together brands from M&M's and Snickers to Pringles and Pop-Tarts in the year's biggest deal to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mars said on Wednesday it will pay US$83.50 per share for Kellanova, representing about a 33 percent premium to its closing price on August 2 before it was first reported that Mars was exploring a deal for the maker of frozen breakfast foods, such as Morningstar Farms and Eggo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal is a bet on consumers continuing to indulge in branded snacks, and comes as packaged food companies face stalling growth after years of price hikes to cover sky-rocketing inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The combined company aims to hold prices steady, said Mars CEO Poul Weihrauch, and not pass on costs from the deal to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a big and stronger company," Weihrauch said. "We hope to be able to absorb more costs in our structure and help alleviate the issues we have in an inflationary environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food prices in the United States increased roughly 25 percent from 2019 through 2023, far more than other categories such as housing and medical care, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture. But inflation has started to moderate, according to the US consumer price index data released on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumers in the United States and Europe – major markets for both companies – have been looking for cheaper alternatives or ditching brands for cheaper private label goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kellanova has seen private label encroach on its market share for cereal in Europe and other areas, said CEO Steve Cahillane. The company sells sweet cereals such as Smacks, Frosties and Coco Pops in Europe, according to securities filings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US packaged food sector is seeing robust dealmaking as companies seek scale to weather the impact of inflation-weary consumers cutting back and shifting their purchases to private label brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think an environment more conducive to deal-making could also encourage some of the large-cap packaged food names within the industry to shift their focus away from portfolio cleanup and divestiture efforts and towards a more offensive, acquisition-led posture with a focus on growth," Barclays analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday. (Reuters)

    WHO declares mpox a global health emergency

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determining a disease outbreak as a "public health emergency of international concern" or PHEIC – the WHO's highest level of alert – can accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and co-operation to contain a disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact. It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Africa's top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,000 suspected mpox cases and 517 deaths have been reported on the African continent so far this year, a 160 percent increase in cases compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. A total of 13 countries have reported cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A different form of the mpox virus – clade IIb – spread globally in 2022, largely through sexual contact among men who have sex with men. This prompted the WHO to declare a public health emergency then, which it ended 10 months later. (Reuters)

    Fresh Gaza peace talks to begin in Qatar

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult the Palestinian group afterwards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US has said it expects indirect talks to go ahead as planned in Qatar's capital Doha on Thursday, and that a ceasefire agreement was still possible, while warning that progress was needed urgently to avert a wider war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Axios reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed a trip to the Middle East that had been expected to begin on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three senior Iranian officials have said that only a ceasefire deal in Gaza would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel will send the negotiations team on the agreed upon date, that's tomorrow August 15th, in order to finalise the details of the implementation of the framework agreement," government spokesperson David Mencer said in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation includes Israel's spy chief David Barnea, head of the domestic security service Ronen Bar and the military's hostages chief Nitzan Alon, a defence official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has voiced scepticism about the chances of the talks delivering real results, blaming Israel for stalling, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been the main obstacle to sealing a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to new negotiations allows the occupation to impose new conditions and employ the maze of negotiation to conduct more massacres," Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas' absence from the talks, however, does not eliminate the chances of progress since its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya is based in Doha and the group has open channels with Egypt and Qatar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas is committed to the proposal presented to it on July 2, which is based on the UN Security Council resolution and the Biden speech and the movement is prepared to immediately begin discussion over a mechanism to implement it," said Abu Zuhri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source familiar with the matter said that Hamas wants the mediators to come back to them with a "serious response" from Israel. If that happens, the group says, it will meet mediators after the Thursday session. (Reuters)

 The infrastructure arm of Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison conglomerate announced on Wednesday that it would put in place a secondary share listing on the London Stock Exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure Holdings said in an announcement that it had sought permission from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and expected to begin trading in its shares on the London bourse’s main market on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The company believes that a listing in London, in addition to the Company’s listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will benefit its geographically diverse shareholder base and will assist in building the company’s profile and provide a greater market for trading in the shares,” CK said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has been appointed to manage the listing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company noted that Britain was its largest market, with 35.7 percent of profit attributable to shareholders coming from the UK last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company had earlier announced a 2 percent increase in earnings for the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure also announced that it was buying a portfolio of windfarms in the UK for HK$3.5 billion, its third acquisition of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it strongly condemned remarks made by the last governor of colonial Hong Kong regarding a recent Court of Final Appeal ruling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chris Patten, writing in the Guardian newspaper, described the top court's decision to uphold the convictions of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019, as "unjust".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the verdict was "made worse" because David Neuberger, a former president of Britain's supreme court, was a party to the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SAR administration said it opposed the former governor's "malicious slandering" against the verdict and his "wanton personal vilifications" against Lord Neuberger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patten's slandering remarks were made in blatant disregard of the detailed legal analysis by the [Court of Final Appeal] in its 76-page judgement and the factual background of the relevant case," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such remarks were made for the sole purpose of exerting political pressure on the judges ... in an attempt to influence the judicial system of the [Hong Kong SAR], and were nothing but a despicable political manoeuvre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said Patten's criticisms against Neuberger were "completely groundless and unjustified personal attacks" aimed at smearing his reputation and undermining the system of non-permanent judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone has the right to express his or her views on court decisions within the boundaries permitted by the law, but no one can abusively criticise or slander judges, or make baseless allegations purely out of political motives," the spokesperson added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethnic minority pupils in Hong Kong who embarked on a mainland study tour under a new visa-free scheme said they had acquired much knowledge about the country's culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of more than 20 students from Yaumati Kaifong Association School returned to the SAR after a three-day trip across Guangdong province, designed to foster a deeper understanding of the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They learnt about martial arts, paper-cutting and Chinese calligraphy, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really enjoyed Chinese calligraphy. It's fun, beautiful and creative," said nine-year-old Dangal Zane, who learnt to write the Chinese character for "family".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now I know more about Chinese culture and arts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her schoolmate Limbu Maeson, 12, said the trip inspired him to contemplate living across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, maybe I'll decide to work there, because there are a lot of businesses," he said. "I feel like the education is more intense in China, because of the exams. Besides that, maybe it will be a good shot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maeson, just like others on the exchange tour, crossed the border using a new travel permit for permanent residents with foreign passports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time when we went to China, it took way longer and we were stressed out about what if we didn't make it," he said, adding that it only took him a minute to pass through immigration this time round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Ka-ho, a school manager who led the tour, had nothing but praise for the new travel scheme for non-Chinese SAR residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, they did not even have the chance to sign up for an exchange tour due to the lack of a permit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But that's not the case anymore. They could sign up for these tours ... so that they have more opportunities to take part in the country's development and observe the progress by travelling to the mainland."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting from July, Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens can apply for a five-year permit to enter the mainland for short-term purposes such as business, tourism and exchanges.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Food Expo returns on Thursday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, as vendors remain hopeful about sales amid the changing spending habits of local consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, nearly half a million people thronged the five-day extravaganza, with the organiser, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, saying they spent an average of $1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the recent trend of Hongkongers spending their weekends in Shenzhen and other parts of Guangdong Province has threatened local businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's marketing associate director, Eddie Lee, pointed out they've done a lot to promote this year's event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing a lot of promotion to communicate the selling point, and the highlights of our expos to...not just our local audience, and by these promotional activities in nearby areas, the Greater Bay Area, we hope also to attract visitors from our nearby cities to visit Hong Kong and participate in our fairs," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the 34th edition of the popular event will be held in conjunction with three other expos, featuring vendors specialising in tea, beauty and wellness products and home appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Admission costs $30 per adult, or $10 if they enter before noon on weekdays or after 6pm every night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An extra $10 is charged for those who wish to enter the "gourmet zone" where visitors are offered a taste of delicacies from around the world, including French foie gras, Australian abalone and Japanese vinegar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tencent has posted a 72 percent year-on-year increase in interim net profit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  First-half earnings at the Chinese internet giant reached 89.5 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not offering an interim dividend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Net profit for the April-June period, meanwhile, jumped 82 percent from a year ago to 47.6 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter revenue climbed 8 percent to 161.1 billion yuan, driven by a recovery in its gaming business after a launch of a new mobile game in May that got off to a strong start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long-awaited "Dungeon & Fighter Mobile" title dominated top-grossing charts on Apple's iOS platform in China for nearly a month after its release, according to industry data. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Cyclothon will be revamped this year, with new routes and a sports-themed carnival being introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's largest cycling event will return on October 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 50-kilometre race will go through the Sha Tin Heights Tunnel, while the 32-kilometre event will cross Ting Kau Bridge for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both races will start in Tsim Sha Tsui and end at the Jordan Road Flyover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Chan, the board's general manager of event and product development, said a carnival will be held in the West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's actually very important for us to add more different elements to our Hong Kong Cyclothon," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for a lot of cyclists, after they finish their 50-kilometre or 32-kilometre [race], it will be actually good for them to have some relaxing experiences, either a dance class, yoga class or stretching class. It's a good hangout place for them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Registration for the cyclothon opens at 10am on August 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The board said it will accept more than 6,000 registrations in total this year – 800 more than last year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday as it ruled against him in an ethics case. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766160_1_20240814165201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who served jail time, raising the spectre of more political upheaval and a reset of the governing alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I respect the verdict. I reiterate that for the almost one year I have been in this role, I have tried with good intentions to lead the country with honesty," Srettha told reporters outside his office after the court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real estate tycoon Srettha becomes the fourth Thai premier in 16 years to be removed by verdicts by the same court, after it ruled he violated the constitution by appointing a minister who did not meet ethical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's removal after less than a year in power means parliament must convene to choose a new premier, with the prospect of more uncertainty in a country dogged for two decades by coups and court rulings that have brought down multiple governments and political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same court last week dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party, the hugely popular opposition, ruling its campaign to reform a law against insulting the crown risked undermining the constitutional monarchy. It regrouped on Friday under a new party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors have borne the brunt of Thailand's turmoil, with two of its governments removed by coups in a long-running grudge match between the party's founders, the billionaire Shinawatra family, and their rivals in the conservative establishment and royalist military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision could rock a fragile truce between political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra and his enemies among the conservative elite and military old guard, which enabled the tycoon's return from 15 years of self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board. The bribery allegation was never proven and Pichit resigned in May.
  <br/>

  Deputy premier Phumtham Wechayachai is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tech giant Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent jump in net profit for the second quarter of the year, driven by strong growth in demand for artificial intelligence servers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple supplier Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent rise in second-quarter net profit, driven by strong AI server demand as the company touted "strong growth momentum" from the technology boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's largest contract electronics maker, said net profit for the April-June quarter rose to US$1.09 billion from US$1.02 billion in the same period the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That beat analysts' average estimate of US$1.06 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the firm's fourth consecutive quarterly profit rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said AI servers accounted for more than 40 percent of its server business in the second quarter, saying its next generation AI computing solution had brought "strong growth momentum."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foxconn had previously expected revenue for the second quarter to grow significantly from a year earlier, although revenue from smart computer electronics including smartphones was likely to be flattish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expected its operations to pick up gradually in the second half as many electronics vendors, including Apple, usually release new products ahead of the year-end holiday season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a report prior to the earnings announcement, Taipei-based KGI Securities revised up its sales forecast for Foxconn this year, saying strong demand for new iPhones and AI servers were likely to lead to a better-than-expected outlook for the firm in the second half. (Reuters)

 The city's top court on Wednesday granted jailed former activist Tam Tak-chi a final attempt to appeal against his conviction and sentence for sedition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three presiding judges at the Court of Final Appeal agreed to look into whether offences under now-repealed sedition laws must be tried at the Court of First Instance before a judge and a jury, and if the prosecution has to prove a defendant intended to incite others to commit violence or public disorder in order to secure a conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appeal is set to be heard by Hong Kong's top court on January 10 next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam, a former vice chairman of People Power, had lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his conviction and 40-month prison sentence for his chanting of slogans in the street in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judges at the lower court ruled that the intention to incite violence was not a necessary element for the offence, and that there's nothing suggesting people were subject to "an unacceptably harsh burden" due to the restriction imposed by it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sedition offences stipulated by sections 9 and 10 of the Crimes Ordinance have since been repealed and replaced by provisions in Hong Kong's domestic national security law.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

    Govt probing alleged resale of public hospital drugs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Medicine from a public hospital was allegedly sold via HKTVMall. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766126_1_20240814124922.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched into suspicions that medicine from a public hospital ended up for sale on an e-commerce platform, authorities said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, HKTVMall said it had removed a merchant from its online marketplace after a buyer complained that packaging for an order came with a label indicating the product had originally been given to a patient of Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The product is a laxative which is not classed as a poison and does not require a prescription or for sales to be supervised by a pharmacist, the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, the administration expressed "grave concern over the suspected resale of public hospital patients' medicines" and said the matter will be dealt with seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The DH (Department of Health) is liaising with the Hospital Authority to seriously investigate into the alleged case and shall take prompt enforcement action as appropriate," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this specific case, the DH will investigate along the line of illegal sale of unregistered pharmaceutical products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, So Yiu-wah, president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, suggested that "over-prescribing" of medicines by public hospitals could have played a role in the alleged incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patient rights advocate Tim Pang, from the Society for Community Organisation, said doctors at public hospitals tend to dish out too much medication because of the length of time patients have to wait for their next consultation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang said more community pharmacies would solve this problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because if there are enough community pharmacies for patients to refill the drugs, then the public hospital doctors can prevent from prescribing a lot of drugs to the patients during that waiting period," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten thousand flats will be built near the future Pak Shek Kok MTR Station next to Tolo Harbour and the Science Park, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new East Rail Line station, between Tai Po Market and University, is expected to be completed by 2033.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the Development Bureau said the MTR Corporation is carrying out extensive technical assessments for the station's construction and land development strategies, with a detailed plan for the project to be announced later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Scott Leung said the MTR station and related transport infrastructure should be built before the residential units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's also a member of the Housing Authority, said this approach would ensure efficient and convenient transport for the residents.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources told RTHK the government was working to have two giant pandas arrive in the SAR by late September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two adult pandas, aged between five and eight, are a gift from mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government confirmed that Secretary for Culture, Sports, and Tourism Kevin Yeung would attend a signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement in Sichuan regarding the arrival of the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will head to the province on Thursday morning with representatives from Ocean Park, and will oversee the logistics of transporting the animals to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said Yeung would also be responsible for naming the pandas, adding that September 26 is one of the potential arrival dates for the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Yeung's return to Hong Kong on Friday, Raistlin Lau will serve as acting culture, sports, and tourism chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee had earlier paid a visit to Sichuan, and said the male panda chosen by mainland authorities is agile and smart, while the female panda is gentle and cute.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kishida confirmed on Wednesday that he will not seek re-election as head of his party next month, meaning the end of his premiership.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday said he would not seek re-election as head of his party, meaning the end of his premiership after just under three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since 1945, is due to hold an internal leadership contest next month. Its popularity ratings have slumped because of rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this presidential election, it is necessary to show the people that the LDP is changing and the party is a new LDP," Kishida told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this, transparent and open elections and free and vigorous debate are important. The most obvious first step to show that the LDP will change is for me to step aside," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will not be running in the forthcoming presidential election."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida had informed senior administration officials of his intention not to run, media including national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo news reported earlier,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the ruling party is traditionally also prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida, 67, has been in office since October 2021, and has seen his and his party's poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices hitting Japanese incomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His cabinet's support rating has been languishing around 25 percent this year, according to an NHK poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's fourth-largest economy has also struggled to gain traction, with output shrinking 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen (more than US$100 billion at the time) as he tried to ease the pressure from inflation and rescue his premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having seen prices barely move for years, Japanese voters have been reeling from rising prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, pushing up energy costs and putting pressure on the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some recovery in recent weeks, the yen has been one of the world's worst-performing currencies over the past year, falling sharply against the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While welcome news to Japanese exporters, this makes imports pricier and stokes inflation for households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before November, the government had injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy over the past three years since the pandemic. (AFP)
