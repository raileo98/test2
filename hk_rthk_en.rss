<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it would launch a formal probe looking into EU practices during an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce will conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises," the ministry said in a note on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministry officials said they had decided to launch the probe following a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint mainly dealt with "products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment", according to the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation will last from July 10 to January 10, 2025, and could be extended to April 10, 2025 under special conditions, the ministry said. (Agencies)

    New sweatsuit helps remove sweat faster: researchers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Polytechnic University say they have developed a new type of smart sweatsuit that helps athletes remove sweat faster.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "iActive" garment has a small device dubbed "artificial sweat glands” installed on the back. It uses low-voltage electricity to collect sweat and move it away from the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Shou Dahua, who led the research, said the device is safe to wear as it only has a low voltage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the idea for the sweatsuit came from how trees transport water through their roots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We collect the water via the root-like structure, and then we dissipate sweat on the bottom area using a low, safe voltage… The sweat dissipation rate is three times faster than the maximum human sweating rate,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition, our sportswear is 60 percent lighter and 50 percent less clingy when soaked, in comparison to conventional sportswear.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides athletes, the garment would also be suitable for outdoor workers, medical professionals and firefighters, Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sweatsuit can also be controlled by a smartphone app, allowing people to adjust the speed of sweat removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The research team said it has conducted various tests to ensure safety, finding that the sweat removal function doesn't deteriorate over time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Let's say after 500 laundry tests or after 100 hours of continuous use, the difference of sweat dissipation rate is quite small, less than five percent,” Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the team is in talks with different sports brands to commercialise the product and aims to price it at HK$800 per garment.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local companies were planning to allocate, on average, 4.3 percent of their annual budget towards employee training and development -- the highest percentage since 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was one of the findings from a survey by the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management which polled 108 companies across 20 industries with over 65,000 full-time employees between March and May this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banking and financial services topped actual spending on employee training at 6.2 percent, followed by the manufacturing sector at 5.8 percent and the hospitality sector at 4.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Average annual training hours per employee in 2023 remained similar to 2022 at 17.3 hours, with 76 percent of companies using webinars or virtual classrooms for training and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey found companies were looking to strengthen employees’ interpersonal and customer service skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “From the macro environment, there’s an urgent need to enhance customer service to attract customers, to retain customers because customer service is one of the core committed edge to outperform the competitors,” said the institute's chairman of learning and development committee Chester Tsang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding artificial intelligence (AI) usage, 77 percent of the surveyed companies allowed the use of AI, with 28 percent of employers providing relevant tools to their employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute suggested companies implement measures to boost employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates as the city faced a talent shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include providing advancement opportunities, identifying and nurturing potential successors, and providing relevant training programmes to employees to bridge skill gaps.

    Appointments underway for new mainland travel permit

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760997_1_20240710121725.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In-person appointments began on Wednesday at China Travel Service centres across Hong Kong for people applying for new mainland travel permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The card allows permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens to travel to the mainland for up to 90 days at a time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man named Johan arrived early at one travel centre on Hong Kong Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just to make it easier to go to China because so far, I've had to apply for a visa, and the visa process is quite time-consuming, so this just makes things a lot easier," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ambos said he travels to the mainland for work several times a week and the new permit will make his trips easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I work with factories in China so every week I'm in [mainland] China two or three or four days. It's a great place to go buy products for different markets of the world. It's got good pricing and good-quality products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the rest of my company are all locals...and this card just makes it easier to go in and out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a woman surnamed Manna told RTHK she needed to make another appointment as she was missing a document from the Immigration Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The applying process is really easy actually, it's just an online submission. But I didn't know that I needed to get something from Tseung Kwan O [immigration office], that approval letter. So I have to go back and get it, and then actually I have to make another appointment," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that was not clear for me, because they said to get the documents, but I didn't get what the document was... But it's okay, three of my family members will be applying, so I can give the message to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Hart said he found the centre to be busy, but said that was understandable given it was the first day of appointments.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A union representing tens of thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea on Wednesday said it would extend a three-day strike indefinitely in a bid to force management to negotiate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike is the biggest labour action in the tech giant's history and steps up pressure on the chipmaker's management, who last week predicted a huge second-quarter operating profit increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(We) declare a second indefinite general strike from July 10, after learning that the management has no willingness to talk," the National Samsung Electronics Union said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 members stopped working Monday for what was meant to be a three-day strike, part of a long-running battle over pay and benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union has more than 30,000 members -- more than a fifth of the company's total workforce. (AFP)

 Mainland customs officers have caught a man at a border crossing point between Hong Kong and Shenzhen with over 100 live snakes stuffed in his trousers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news of the reptilian round-up was announced by China Customs on its official WeChat account on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers at the Futian boundary control point recently stopped the man, who was passing through the checkpoint without making any declarations, for an inspection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found 104 live snakes in six sealed drawstring bags that were in the man's pockets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were five types of reptiles, including milk snakes and corn snakes, with most of them being introduced species.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the governemnt was actively pursuing membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a summit organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Lee said the SAR could contribute to the regional economy by becoming a RCEP member.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can offer RCEP member enterprises a wider range of high-quality service options, including supply chain management services, and financial and professional services," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will assist them to better connect and leverage the limitless opportunities brought by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, promoting economic development and innovation in the RCEP member countries and the overall region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the current government administration had been seeking support from RCEP members by making overseas visits to regions such as the Middle East and ASEAN countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong offered a safe and convenient business environment for mainland companies to expand globally, and for foreign companies to enter the mainland market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi was on target as 2022 world champions Argentina turned on the style to beat Canada 2-0 on Tuesday and reach the Copa America final where they will look for a third straight major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-times Copa champions produced their best display of the tournament in front of a capacity crowd at the 82,500 MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina soaked up some early pressure before Julian Alvarez ghosted in between two defenders to open the scoring with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Messi had chances throughout the match and doubled the lead in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The truth is that it's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentina national team has been doing," Messi told TyC Sports after his first goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not easy for us to be in a final again, for us to compete again to be champions. I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defending Copa champions will face the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Uruguay and Colombia in what will be a highly anticipated final in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit," said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight," he added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index rose just over 90 points, or about 0.5 percent, at the opening on Wednesday to trade at around 17,613.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the US is "no longer an overheated economy," remarks that suggested the case for rate cuts is strengthening. Some investors had anticipated the Fed chair, in his testimony to a Senate banking panel, might do more than he did to telegraph that a cut was on track for the central bank's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index opened down 0.35 percent at 2,949. The Component Index in Shenzhen also opened lower, falling 0.39 percent to 8,672 points in early trading. (with additional reporting from Reuters and Xinhua)

 Consumer price inflation on the mainland slowed in June, while producer price deflation persisted, as Beijing's support measures set a bumpy economic recovery in motion for the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent rise in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CPI edged down 0.2 percent month-on-month, versus a 0.1 percent drop in May and worsening from an expected 0.1% fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) fell 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, narrowing from a 1.4 percent decline the previous month, and matching a forecast 0.8 percent fall. (Reuters)

    First choice allocations lower in scramble for schools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Education Bureau says 91 percent of primary six pupils got a secondary school place among their top three choices. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760957_1_20240710093545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parents choosing a secondary school for their child may have been too optimistic about securing their top choice in this year's secondary school allocation, which was announced on Tuesday. That's according to Rizwan Ullah, who is a secondary school vice-principal and a Kowloon City councillor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Ullah said an overestimation of emigration may have been a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the number this year, one thing that could explain the drop is probably due to parents being a little bit aggressive with their strategy in finding a school for their children, believing the decline in student population will bring benefits to them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said with the children from the mainland talent scheme and with many parents competing for the same spot, this had led to a decrease in the percentage of children getting into their first choice of school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Education Bureau said 62 percent secured their first choice via central allocation, down from 66 percent last year, and the lowest since 2020. However 91 percent of the around 51,000 primary six pupils did get a place among their top three choices
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with some children in tears about not getting into one of their top three choices of school, Ullah said there were no bad schools and that parents shouldn't put too much pressure on their kids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The children are upset partly because we have created that expectation - if you don't get these three then the child will feel bad. It's just like running in a race, it's the first three. If you're the fourth, you don't get a medal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually, if you look, many students who go to these different schools, they do well in different aspects because we talk about whole-person development and we look at the healthy development of the child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said it was therefore important not to create too many expectations for children, as the child may have some hidden talent. He said it was just one part of the education process and there were other elements, going forward, like university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah also said parents should pick a school, which they believe matches their child's ability, so their child will have a higher chance of getting in.

    Alcaraz, Medvedev set up semi-final repeat, Sinner out

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev set up a Wimbledon semi-final repeat on Tuesday, while Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner to reach a second successive Wimbledon final four.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz battled back from a set down to defeat Tommy Paul 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 while Medvedev stunned world number one Jannik Sinner, who suffered a mid-match health scare, 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish world number three Alcaraz, seeking a fourth Grand Slam title, was broken twice by 12th-seeded Paul in a 72-minute first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three breaks in the third set put the Spaniard in charge and he stepped up another gear in the fourth, making just four unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, seeking to become just the sixth man to capture the French Open and Wimbledon titles back to back, defeated Medvedev in straights sets in last year's Wimbledon semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner in five sets on Tuesday to reach a second successive Wimbledon semi-final, subduing the gallant challenge of the Italian, who suffered a worrying mid-match health scare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-ranked Medvedev triumphed 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3 to avenge his Australian Open final loss to Sinner in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His four-hour victory also ended a five-match losing streak against the Italian as Medvedev reached his ninth Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a tight first set in which neither man gave up a break point, Medvedev edged ahead in the tie-break on the back of a lung-busting 33-shot rally. However, he squandered a set point and his game suddenly fell apart, serving up a double fault as Sinner pocketed the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mercurial Russian carved out the only break of the second set in the third game on his way to levelling the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner slipped another break down at 2-1 in the third set and immediately summoned the tournament physio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian, appearing distressed, had his blood pressure taken courtside before he left for a medical time-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a 10-minute delay, the 22-year-old resumed play and thrilled the Centre Court crowd when he bravely clawed his way back to 5-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Italian was undaunted and levelled the quarter-final on the back of breaks in the third and fifth games of the fourth set. But it was Medvedev finished the fresher of the two players, breaking in the final set on his way to victory. (AFP)

    Yamal makes history as Spain reach Euro 2024 final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Yamal becomes the youngest-ever scorer in a European Championship. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760947_1_20240710062439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani's opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will now face the winners of Wednesday's match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a anti-climactic end to France's tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France's Jules Kounde.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq edged to fresh records on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell reported "modest" progress in countering inflation ahead of the publication of influential US pricing data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," Powell told a Senate panel in remarks that kept alive hopes for potential interest rate cuts later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,291.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent to 5,576, while the Nasdaq also advanced 0.1 percent to 18,429, ending at a record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have seen the spate of recent records as reflecting a combination of still solid labour market data with improving inflation trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some market watchers think equities could be poised for a pullback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So much good news is already discounted in the market that it would be easy for it to get a bit of news that's negative and then correct," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "It's gone so far so fast."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides key inflation data, this week's calendar includes a spate of earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large banks, kicking off the second-quarter reporting season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Boeing fell 1.4 percent after reporting it delivered 44 planes in June, its best month so far in 2024. However, overall commercial plane deliveries for the second quarter still dropped by nearly one-third to 92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 3.7 percent, rising for the 10th straight session amid anticipation of the company's presentation on "Robotaxis" next month. (AFP)

    Heavy battles in Gaza City on eve of new truce talks

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Hamas says the fighting in Gaza City is "the most intense in months." Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760931_1_20240710013814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli forces in war-ravaged Gaza City pushed on with a major offensive on Tuesday that has again displaced Palestinians, as UN experts said children were dying in a "starvation campaign."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Troops, tanks and fighter jets swooped on Gaza's biggest urban area on the eve of new contacts in Qatar aiming for an eventual hostage-prisoner exchange and a truce in the war raging into its 10th month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CIA director William Burns and Israel's Mossad chief David Barnea are due to travel to Qatar on Wednesday, after Burns held talks with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas, whose October 7 attack triggered the war, has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of deliberately escalating fighting in Gaza City and Rafah, in the territory's south, to thwart an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamist group's Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh said he had made "urgent contact" with mediators, warning that the "catastrophic consequences" of the latest battles could "reset the negotiation process to square one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, described the fighting in Gaza City in recent days as "the most intense in months."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants were fighting with rockets, mortars and explosives, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two weeks of battles in Gaza City's eastern Shujaiya district, Israeli forces have extended the fighting into the city's east, west and south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents reported helicopter strikes, "explosions and numerous gun battles" in the city's southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it was pursuing Palestinian militants in Gaza City, six months after it said it had dismantled Hamas's "military framework" in the territory's north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft struck the city as troops were engaged in "close-quarters combat," seizing weapons and destroying tunnels, the military said, reporting "dozens" of militants killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said tens of thousands of civilians have been affected by the surge in fighting since the first of three evacuation orders for Gaza City was declared on June 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands were seen marching down dusty roads past bombed-out buildings, with mothers carrying babies and others packing belongings onto donkey carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Human Rights Office said it was "appalled" at the way civilians, many of whom have been displaced multiple times, have been ordered to head to areas where "military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza City residents have now been told to move south to Deir al-Balah, which the UN office said "is already seriously overcrowded" with displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, independent UN rights experts accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign" that has resulted in the deaths of Gazan children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence," the experts said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thirty-four Palestinians have died from malnutrition since October 7, the majority being children," said the experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva accused the panel's members of "spreading misinformation" and "supporting Hamas propaganda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,243 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The toll includes at least 50 killed over the past 24 hours, said a ministry statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar and Egypt, supported by the United States, have been engaged in months of behind-the-scenes contacts to start truce talks and organise an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has signalled that it would drop its insistence on a "complete" ceasefire – which Israel had repeatedly rejected – as a condition for starting talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has set out conditions for talks, including that "any deal will allow Israel to return and fight until all the goals of the war are achieved," including the destruction of Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Gaza war has raged on, Israel has also exchanged regular cross-border fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah, allies of Hamas, heightening fears of an all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah on Tuesday released a video showing aerial surveillance footage it said was taken over intelligence and military positions in the Israeli-annexed Syrian Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release came after an Israeli strike killed a senior Hezbollah commander last week. The group's chief Hassan Nasrallah was expected to make a televised address on Wednesday at an event commemorating the slain fighter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Nasrallah on social media to "stop the threats and violence," and "withdraw" Hezbollah forces from the border area, in line with a 2006 UN Security Council resolution that ended their latest major war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanese government has supported the implementation of Resolution 1701, which called for armed personnel to pull back north of the Litani River, some 30 kilometres from the border with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a full-blown conflict breaks out, Israel's top diplomat said Nasrallah "will be considered the destroyer of Lebanon." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's new lawmakers excitedly squeezed into parliament on Tuesday with Labour sitting on the government's side of the chamber for the first time in 14 years following last week's landslide election win.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 400 Labour MPs jostled for space on the ruling side of the green-benched House of Commons, with many having to stand, as parliament returned after being dissolved before Thursday's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the house for the first time as Britain's leader, vowing to "put an end to a politics that has too often seemed self-serving and self-obsessed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all have a duty to show that politics can be a force for good," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted the new parliament was "the most diverse parliament by race and gender this country has ever seen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the House of Commons Library, a record 263 or 40 percent of the 650 MPs are women, up from 220 in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 90 are from minority ethnic backgrounds, an increase from 66 five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rishi Sunak – Conservative prime minister until last week – made his first speech as leader of the opposition, and congratulated Starmer on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described being an MP as the "greatest honour, privilege and responsibility," in a congenial session that contrasted sharply with the usual arguing and shouting seen in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The session started with lawmakers re-electing Lindsay Hoyle as speaker of the house unopposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tradition dictated that he was physically dragged to the speakers' chair by colleagues, a custom rooted in the speaker's original function to communicate the Commons' opinions to the monarch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historically, if the monarch did not agree with the message being communicated then the early death of the speaker could follow – leading to reluctance among some to take up the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the addresses by Starmer and Sunak, other party leaders had their turn, including arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage who declared the five MPs from his anti-immigration Reform UK party the "new kids on the block."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have no experience in this parliament whatsoever, even though some of us have tried many times over the years previously," he said, a reference to his previous seven failed attempts to be elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament then began the lengthy process of swearing in all 650 MPs. Some 335 of them are new to parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the British monarchy and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Monday, new MPs have been receiving tours of the parliamentary estate, while some ex-lawmakers who lost their seats last week have been seen saying their goodbyes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour won 411 seats, securing a majority of more than 170 as it returned to power for the first time since Gordon Brown was prime minister in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tories suffered their worst-ever electoral defeat, succumbing to just 121 MPs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak is due to stay in charge of the party until the Conservatives work out the timetable for his successor to be chosen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new parliamentary session will officially begin after Starmer's government puts forward its priorities for the term in the King's speech on Wednesday 17 July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to include the establishment of a new publicly owned investment company called Great British Energy and a plan to renationalise Britain's much-maligned railways. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Craig Bellamy says he is keen to get started with their Nations League games. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760928_1_20240710003437.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Craig Bellamy has been appointed as the new head coach of the Wales national football team on a contract until 2028, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bellamy has replaced Rob Page, who was sacked following Wales' failure to qualify for Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old former Liverpool, Newcastle and Wales striker leaves Burnley, where he was assistant to former manager Vincent Kompany last season as they were relegated from the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will give my full commitment to develop this team and I am passionate to bring continued success into Welsh football," Bellamy told the FAW website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to get started with our Nations League games in September."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FAW's chief football officer, Dr David Adams, said: "I am absolutely delighted to announce Craig as our new head coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We undertook a thorough recruitment process for the new men's national team head coach and Craig was identified as the standout candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all looking forward to the Nations League games and working with Craig to deliver success for Welsh Football."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley chairman Alan Pace added: "I want to thank Craig for all his hard work during his time at Burnley and wish him the best for his new position as Wales manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Craig has been a very important part of our wonderful journey the last two years. I've admired his leadership, knowledge and passion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Page guided Wales to their first World Cup in 64 years in 2022 and to the second round of Euro 2020 but failed to reach this year's Euros, losing in a penalty shoot-out to Poland in a play-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he subsequently oversaw one of the most embarrassing results in Wales' history, a 0-0 draw with Gibraltar in a friendly and then suffered a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wales' next game is the opening match of their Nations League campaign against Turkey on September 6, with a trip to Montenegro three days later. (AFP)

    Fed's Powell sees 'modest' progress on inflation

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760920_1_20240709225800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve is making "modest" progress in its inflation fight, the head of the US central bank told lawmakers on Tuesday, on the first of two days of testimony in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  When prices surged in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed responded by hiking interest rates to a two-decade high as it attempts to cool down the US economy and return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation has eased significantly since it peaked in 2022, but progress stalled in the first quarter of this year, effectively putting the Fed's fight on pause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data in the second quarter has been more encouraging, prompting some cautious optimism from some policymakers in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers in Washington, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said most recent readings "have shown some modest further progress" since the first quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," he added during his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee to discuss the Fed's semi-annual monetary policy report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers on Tuesday – and again the following day in the House of Representatives – about the impact of the Fed's high interest rates on everyday Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is widely expected to remain on pause when it meets to set interest rates later this month, but could begin cutting rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures traders have assigned a probability of more than 75 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by mid-September, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also see it as more likely than not that the Fed will make another quarter percentage-point cut by the end of the year. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday held a flag presentation ceremony for the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics ahead of the start of the Games later this month, with Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan announcing higher rewards to further motivate athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I’m glad to learn about the Jockey Club Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, which will increase the reward for athletes. There will be a 20 percent increase in cash incentives in total compared with the last Olympics. For example, the reward for an individual gold medallist will be raised to HK$6 million. This is a great way to motivate our athletes to strive for better results,” he said at the ceremony at the government headquarters in Tamar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also revealed that due to the rising temperatures in Paris, the administration plans to provide air conditioners for athletes competing there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The order's been placed, the equipment's on its way… I'm going there on July 22nd, and I anticipate that all our rooms [will] have the air conditioning,” said Brian Stevenson, Chef de Mission for the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending a delegation of about 90 people to Paris. Among them are 35 athletes, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Épée fencer Vivian Kong, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is now heading to Paris as the world number one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said her mindset has changed since the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the biggest difference between these three years is that Tokyo gave me a lot of time to reflect on why I want to train, why I want to become better, why I want to win, because it doesn't seem to matter if people aren't healthy, if people aren't happy. There are more important things than sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think this time in Paris we can really enjoy sports... Hopefully everyone's healthy again and that it gives more purpose and motivation for me to do well.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For veteran swimmer Camille Cheng, this will be her third Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her family will be in Paris to see her in action in the Games for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think about this time of the season as really the fun part of the season. We've put in the hard work. It's all about the small details, fine-tuning things, focusing on recovery," Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And really, I think more than anything, it's about mentally so that you're in a happy place, that you're surrounded by positive energy... because for me I believe that a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sprinter Felix Diu made the final cut to the Olympics through a wild-card. The 100m specialist and first-time Olympian said his goal is to achieve a personal best at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My expectation for the Olympics is to get a [personal best time] for like 10.3 or 10.2 seconds,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Wai-fung, another Olympic debutant, secured Hong Kong's first-ever Taekwondo Olympic qualification. While excited about that, he said he feels the pressure of representing all the Taekwondo enthusiasts in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes to bring home a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will be held from July 26 to August 11.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has died while climbing Mount Fuji in Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to Japanese media, the 58-year-old man was found unconscious while climbing the mountain from Yamanashi prefecture on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was pronounced dead later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said it'd received a request for assistance. It has initiated follow-up actions through the commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese embassy in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added it has provided appropriate advice and assistance to the family members of the victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japanese media quoted local police as saying this was the first death reported since the opening of the 3,776m mountain to hikers this summer.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong (ACGHK) organisers on Tuesday said they hope to avoid overcrowding issues at this year's event by charging separately for entry to the cosplay and exhibition areas, rather than issuing all-in-one tickets as they have in the past.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event from July 26 at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ACGHK's chief executive officer, Leung Chung-pun, said more than 140 exhibitors will take part in the fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Apart from Hong Kong citizens being the mainstream, we welcomed visitors from more than 30 countries and regions [last year]... ACGHK has a very stable foundation to continue developing into the most influential anime exhibition in the whole of Asia, or even the world,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticket details will be announced at a later date.

    Officials working on quicker border clearance: Tang

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says the new border clearance system will be quicker. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760875_1_20240709163739.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security Secretary Chris Tang said on Tuesday that the government has been discussing with Shenzhen officials a plan to speed up immigration clearance procedures at two border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A "collaborative inspection and joint clearance" arrangement at Huanggang Port and Sha Tau Kok will see e-channels and counters of both jurisdictions set up side by side, with travellers only having to have their documents checked once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrangement has been in place on the border between Macau and Zhuhai since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of a review of his bureau's work in the past year, Tang also noted in a social media post that since last week, Hong Kong permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens have been able to apply for five-year travel permits for the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He further noted that in May, mainland authorities expanded a travel scheme for mainland professionals from six industries to visit Hong Kong.

 Indonesian rescuers resumed the search on Tuesday for 45 people still missing after a landslide at an illegal gold mine on Sulawesi island that killed at least 17 people, an official at the country's search and rescue agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain triggered the disaster on Sunday morning in the district of Suwawa in Gorontalo province, with the landslide engulfing miners and residents living nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salama, an official at Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said rescue efforts restarted on Tuesday after being temporarily halted on Monday due to heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 400 people were involved in the rescue operation, aided by a helicopter, said Salama.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far 52 people had been found alive, though the operation was being hampered by thick mud and with some rescuers having to walk more than 20km to reach the site of the disaster, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said torrential rains that have pounded the mountainous district since Saturday triggered the landslide and broke an embankment, causing floods up to the roofs of houses in five villages in Bone Bolango, which is part of a mountainous district in Gorontalo province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 300 houses were affected and more than 1,000 people fled for safety.

 China has allocated an additional 848 million yuan to support local flood rescue efforts, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fund, allocated by the MOF and the Ministry of Water Resources, will mainly be used to assist rescue work by local authorities in the flood-hit regions, including Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei and Guangdong provinces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, rescue personnel successfully sealed a 226m breach in a dyke at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, on Monday, according to local authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.31pm, the final truckload of rocks was dumped into the breach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sealing will expedite drainage and post-disaster reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The breach at Dongting Lake in the city of Yueyang in Hunan was caused by floodwaters from torrential rain, with more than 7,000 residents evacuated since the dyke burst on Friday afternoon. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mainland's central bank on Tuesday announced that global investors will be given more choice of collateral for trading government bonds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will allow offshore investors to use onshore bonds under Northbound Bond Connect as margin collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bonds are limited to those issued by the Ministry of Finance and mainland policy banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of the launch of Bond Connect, Jiang Huifen from the PBOC said the new move will reduce the cost for overseas investors to trade mainland bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to help further expand the application of renminbi bonds as eligible offshore collateral. It will facilitate overseas institutions to hold renminbi bonds, reducing the costs of overseas institutional investors to join Swap Connect. This initiative will be jointly prepared with Hong Kong and will be launched as soon as possible," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's market regulators and the stock exchange operator welcomed the PBOC's new initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said it plans to implement the new measure by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission said they will guide financial infrastructure institutions to take forward the preparatory work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure will provide Northbound Swap Connect investors with the additional choice of non-cash collateral, reducing their liquidity cost and improving capital efficiency. It will also help vitalise offshore investors' onshore bond holdings and further enhance the attractiveness of onshore bonds," an HKMA spokesperson said.

 Stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai were lower ahead of a key policy meeting in China next week.
 <br>

  <br/>
  Traders will also be keenly watching Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's remarks to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for any indications of when the Fed will start cutting rates.

  Powell last week fanned hopes of a cut, saying the battle against inflation had made "progress" and the job market was cooling. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee says the pair chosen by mainland officials are now undergoing preparatory work in Sichuan. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760841_1_20240709114958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said mainland authorities have chosen two adult giant pandas, aged between five and eight, to be sent to Hong Kong as gifts, hoping the pair will be able to breed in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said the male panda, which weighs around 120 kilogrammes, is agile and smart, while the 100-kilogramme female panda is gentle and cute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up a three-day visit to Sichuan, the chief executive thanked mainland officials for thoroughly considering the city's requests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had earlier expressed to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration the hope that the two new giant pandas would be able to give birth to the next generation of pandas in Hong Kong, bringing more warmth and joy to Hong Kong. We also hope the giant pandas will be younger adults and physically strong," he told reporters in Chengdu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This pair are now undergoing preparatory work in Dujiangyan, and will be quarantined for 30 days later on. When they arrive in Hong Kong, they will be quarantined for another 30 days. They will then be given time to adapt, before meeting the public."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Ocean Park will sign a cooperation pact with a mainland giant panda research and breeding facility, and that Hong Kong aims to have the pair arrive by National Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a government statement, the CE highlighted three achievements made during the visit: "the pair of giant pandas to be gifted to Hong Kong have been selected; Ocean Park and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda are working at full steam to draft a co-operation agreement on the details to expedite the approval and implementation of the process; and the establishment of communication channels between Ocean Park, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda to collaborate with and assist one another in facilitating the smooth transfer of the giant pandas to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the culture, sports and tourism minister, said Ocean Park is sending staff members to the province to better understand the giant pandas, while bringing with them bamboo the pair will be consuming in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Ocean Park] will enhance its two facilities for giant pandas, such as adding some plants or climbing frames. We are also considering installing cameras to hopefully share the pandas' activities with the public in real time," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the park will assist with the physical examination of the animals.

    Nato meets in Washington as questions swirl over Biden

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760842_1_20240709120924.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato leaders gather on Tuesday in Washington for a summit aimed at showing resolve against Russia and support for Ukraine – but the meeting is set to be overshadowed by US President Joe Biden's fight for political survival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old leader will try to use the three days of pomp marking Nato's 75th anniversary to reassure allies over US leadership, and his own ability to govern, as calls grow for him to quit the fight for a second term in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has so far defied pressure from some within his own party to step aside, after a bad debate performance against election rival Donald Trump last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our allies are looking for US leadership," Biden said in an interview on Monday. "Who else do you think could step in here and do this? I expanded Nato. I solidified Nato."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As doubts swirl over Biden, the rest of the 32-nation alliance is nervously eyeing a potential return to the White House by Trump after elections in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the campaign trail the ex-reality TV star has threatened to blow apart the principle of mutual self-defence that has underpinned Nato since it was founded in the wake of the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is not just the United States that faces political questions. French President Emmanuel Macron arrives after fending off a push by the country's far-right to win power, new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has his first international outing, and Hungary's premier Viktor Orban flies in after a much-criticised meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said he would discuss with Nato leaders the distinct threat North Korea poses to Europe by deepening military ties with Russia, warning that Moscow must choose between the two Koreas where its true interests lie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It "depends entirely" on Russia where it wants to take future ties with South Korea, Yoon said, adding that Seoul would make a decision on weapons support for Ukraine based on how a new military pact between Moscow and Pyongyang plays out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Military co-operation between Russia and North Korea poses a distinct threat and grave challenge to the peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Europe," Yoon said. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of performers are gathering in Hong Kong for a six-day event that combines Chinese martial arts and dance to showcase the rich heritage of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Kungfu x Dance Carnival aims to help people develop a deeper appreciation of traditional Chinese culture through a variety of activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video message at the opening ceremony in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive John Lee described the carnival as one of the biggest events in Hong Kong this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the carnival uniquely combines martial arts and dance to showcase the charm of Chinese culture, adding that it serves as a platform to promote cultural exchanges between China and other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Ya, founder of Tangya Arts Tech, which organises the event, said she was delighted to bring together performers from around the world, adding that it was a demonstration of Hong Kong's strength as a centre for cultural and artistic exchange between China and the rest of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are delighted to have attracted 3,000 performers from Hong Kong, the mainland, Macau and more than 10 other countries around the world. They range from four-year-old children to an 82-year-old Tai Chi master from Japan and a 96-year-old Choy Li Fut martial arts master," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Tuesday said authorities must strike a balance between public finances and how much public housing tenants can afford to pay in rent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made the comment after the Housing Authority proposed raising public housing rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some elderly tenants have expressed concerns that they will struggle to afford the increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said authorities have to strike a balance between public affordability and financial stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone understands that the rent for public housing is much cheaper than in the private market... In public housing, we take care of the living environment, cleanliness, rubbish collection, and maintenance. The rent is low but it helps us maintain financial stability," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister said poor families can apply for rent assistance that cuts their rent by up to 50 percent, adding that the government has been paying the rent for those supported by Comprehensive Social Security Assistance.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has attacked cities across Ukraine with a missile barrage that killed more than three dozen people and ripped open a children's hospital in Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of volunteers including hospital staff and rescue workers dug through debris from the Okhmatdyt paediatric hospital in search for survivors after the rare day-time bombardment on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched dozens of missiles toward five towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine as well as the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 37 people were killed, including three children, with more than 170 wounded, Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strikes damaged nearly 100 buildings, including multiple schools and a maternity hospital, he added. The air force said air defence systems downed 30 projectiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary to shoot down Russian missiles. It is necessary to destroy the Russian combat aircraft on its bases. It is necessary to take strong steps that will not leave any security deficit," Zelensky said ahead of a Nato summit where arming Ukraine's air defences is expected to top the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the barrage and urged Ukraine's allies to deliver "a stronger response" to Russia's attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the strikes, US President Joe Biden on Monday promised "new measures" to boost Ukraine's air defences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with our allies, we will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine's air defences to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack spurred a fire at a power substation and at an oil depot in Russia's Volgograd region, the governor of the region in southern Russia said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Air defence and electronic warfare forces suppressed a UAV [unnamed aerial vehicle] attack on the territory of the Volgograd region," Andrei Bocharov, the governor, said in a post published on the Telegram channel of the region's administration.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung says the government wants to regulate online ride-hailing services so as to protect people's safety and rights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature on Monday, officials said they plan to give out licences for such services, proposing that the courts could order the seizure of vehicles involved in providing services illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said those convicted of providing illegal ride-hailing services could have their driving licence suspended for a period of time, possibly a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, Lam said officials came up with the plans after studying the experiences of other places, such as Shenzhen and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The biggest effect for us regulating online ride-hailing services is that we hope to be able to protect the safety and rights of passengers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without a regulatory framework, the rights and safety might be affected, or insurance issues. I think these are topics that the general public attaches importance to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam’s bureau said transport officials will study public views and how people's needs are changing, with a view to presenting a legislative proposal next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has been vetting applications for the formation of taxi fleets, as it plans to give out five licences this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam told RTHK that the government is open to the idea of fleet operators cooperating with mainland service providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issues are scheduled to be discussed at a Legco panel meeting on Friday.

    'Supply and demand to be a factor in ride-hailing'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Gary Zhang says it is noticeable that the government has referred to supply and demand as it moves to regulate online car-hailing platforms, such as Uber.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to lawmakers on Monday, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said it aimed to present the legislative proposal next year but it would first carry out a study on passenger demand and changing needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Zhang said the government had only previously referred to taxi quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact in the policy paper that the government submitted to the Legislative Council yesterday, the government doesn't really take a very clear stance. But they propose further research," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I noticed that in the process of this further research, the government said it would not only just consider the regulation of ride-hailing platforms but also a review of the supply and demand situation of point-to-point transportation services. Traditionally the government seldom mentions such terms as a supply-and-demand issue in any previous public policy document. The discussion generally focused on the service quality of taxis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang said he believed the issue of quality was more likely a result of supply and demand problems. He said it was positive that the government was willing to focus on clarifying this issue in upcoming research, and that this would make further discussions data driven and more scientific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has proposed regulating online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate. But it is also proposing to increase the deterrent effect by withdrawing a driver's licence for a minimum period of time, such as 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau has said it would work with the Department of Justice and police to finalise details.

    Djokovic blasts fans' 'disrespect' at Wimbledon

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic accused Wimbledon fans of "disrespect" in a withering on-court tirade after reaching a 60th Grand Slam quarter-final and 15th at the All England Club on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number two Djokovic, the seven-time champion at Wimbledon and chasing a record-setting 25th major, defeated 15th-ranked Holger Rune 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic then launched a bitter outburst at a section of Centre Court fans who constantly chanted "Rune" throughout the match, echoing the shouts of "Root", popularised by cricket fans in the country in support of former England cricket skipper Joe Root.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To all the fans that have had respect and stayed here tonight, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I appreciate it," said an angry Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And to all those people that have chosen to disrespect the player–in this case me – have a goooooooood night," he added, mocking his tormentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When told by the TV interviewer that some fans were shouting "Rune" rather than booing, Djokovic hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were. They were. I am not accepting it. No no no. I know they were cheering for Rune but that's an excuse to also boo," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Listen, I have been on the tour for more than 20 years. I know all the tricks. I focus on the respectful people that pay for the ticket, and love tennis and appreciate the players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have played in much more hostile environments, trust me – you guys can't touch me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic goes on to face Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur for a place in the semi-finals. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street ended mixed, with traders focused on inflation data out later in the week and testimony from Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760781_1_20240709034917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended mixed on Monday as investors awaited fresh inflation data, commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the start of quarterly earnings season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 5.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,572.85, the Nasdaq Composite gained 50.98 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,403.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to 39,344.79.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and other chipmakers rose, lifting the Philadelphia semiconductor index about 2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders will scrutinize consumer price data due on Thursday and producer price data expected on Friday to gauge the Fed's progress in fighting inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors worry that waiting too long to cut interest rates could damage the labor market and push the economy into a recession. They will closely monitor Powell's semiannual testimony before US Senate and House committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What investors want to hear is a dovish tone and an acknowledgement that the two-sided risks are more evenly balanced today, in particular, with respect to the labour market," said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations for interest rate cuts as early as September grew after Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed US job growth slowed in June - the latest data to point to weakness in labour market conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a greater than 75 percent chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points by September, up from last week's 60 percent, according to CME's FedWatch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are slated to kick off Wall Street's second-quarter earnings season on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramount Global fell after it agreed on Sunday to merge with Skydance Media, scripting a new chapter for one of Hollywood's oldest studios.

    New BYD plant in Turkey eyes EU market

    <![CDATA[<img alt="BYD plans to open a production facility and a research and development centre in Turkey. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760778_1_20240709005335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland electric vehicle giant BYD on Monday signed a US$1 billion agreement with Turkey to open a plant in the country in a move that would help it dodge new EU tariffs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The signing ceremony in Istanbul between BYD's CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey's industry and technology minister Fatih Kacir was overseen by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Turkish industry and technology ministry, BYD will open a production facility with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles as well as a research and development centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant will provide direct employment for 5,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news comes days after the European Union slapped additional provisional tariffs of up to 38 percent on Chinese EVs following an investigation that concluded state subsidies meant they were unfairly undermining European rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish-made cars enjoy beneficial access to the EU under a customs union that dates to 1995 and the Marmara region around Istanbul has become one of the leading centres of the world's automobile industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major carmakers including Fiat and Renault opened plants there at the beginning of the 1970s, with others like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai following, taking advantage of Turkey's position at the crossroads between Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The land that was previously allocated for Volkswagen in Manisa in the north of the Western porty city of Izmir would be given to the Chinese company, the daily newspaper Yeni Safak reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BYD is the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles and one of the most advanced in terms of technology and manufacturing quality," independent consultant Levent Taylan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, this will be an investment for the Turkish market but especially European market, by circumventing the customs tariffs imposed on vehicles of Chinese origin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said BYD has a potential to sell around 20,000-25,000 vehicles per year on the Turkish market and export 75,000 to the EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under new Turkish regulations on investment incentives BYD will be able to circumvent a new 40 percent tariff that Turkey imposed on electric vehicle imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has led the global shift to electric vehicles, with almost one in three cars on its roads set to be electric by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency's annual Global EV Outlook. (AFP)

    Boeing reaches settlement with regulators over crashes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing's compliance measures and safety have been in the spotlight after a series of incidents, including two 737 MAX crashes. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760776_1_20240709002048.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing said on Monday it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, which court papers show would see the aviation giant plead guilty to fraud.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department," Boeing told AFP in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of crash victims immediately filed an objection to the deal, arguing that it "unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Berthet, who lost her daughter Camille in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in 2019 -- involving a 737 MAX 8 -- said the deal reflects "weakness and manifest contempt for the victims' families and public interest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court papers filed in Texas on Sunday said the company had agreed to plead guilty to "conspiracy to defraud the United States" during the certification of MAX airplanes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plea deal sees Boeing avoid a criminal trial, instead agreeing to a series of terms including a US$243.6 million fine on top of the same sum already paid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company will also be required to make a minimum investment of US$455 million in "compliance and safety programs".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such changes at the firm will be overseen by an independent monitor appointed by the government for a three-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's board of directors will also be required to meet the families of crash victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The families of victims will ask the court to reject the plea deal at an upcoming hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises," said the objection filed by their legal team Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement shared by her lawyers, Berthet added that the agreement shows the DOJ's "deafness" despite an alarming rise in incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it did not violate the 2021 accord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DOJ representatives briefed families in late June on the proposed plea deal and the company was given until July 5 to accept the offer, or face trial. (AFP)

    Govt proposes licensing of online car-hailing platform

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport and Logistics Bureau on Monday proposed to regulate online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said it aims to present the legislative proposal next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before making the new rules, the bureau will carry out a study on passenger demand and how their needs are changing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it has already increased penalties for illegal ride-hailing services, but there are limits to enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is proposing to increase the deterrent effect by withdrawing a driver's licence for a minimum period of time, such as 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it would work with the Department of Justice and the police to work out the details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also looked at how other places deal with illegal ride-hailing services, noting that there are already laws regulating online car-hailing platforms in places such as Shenzhen, Singapore, Japan and London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in Shenzhen, for example, people who provide unlicensed ride-hailing services can be fined up to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Uber said it welcomed the government's plan to create a regulatory framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a spokesman for the car-hailing platform said authorities should avoid imposing limits on the number of vehicles that can operate under each platform, warning that this could make ride-hailing services more expensive.

 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said the government is inclined to charge lower, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel when it takes over the tunnel in the New Territories in May next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, private car and taxi drivers pay HK$58, while commercial vehicle drivers pay between HK$64 and HK$79.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, officials have outlined three different pricing scenarios, with the third suggesting different tolls for peak, regular and off-peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Private car drivers would pay HK$45, HK$35 and HK$20 respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taxi drivers would pay HK$30 at all times, while commercial vehicles would be charged HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current administration, Lam said officials had spoken to lawmakers about the way forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said most of them supported the idea of charging time-varying tolls, which has been adopted for the three cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since we have all experienced time-varying tolls with the three tunnels and have seen the results, everyone thought about doing the same with the Tai Lam Tunnel," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So right now, the government is inclined to think that a time-varying toll is also a feasible option for Tai Lam."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said a final decision on tolls would be made by the end of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday launched a two-month public consultation on ways to enhance the Copyright Ordinance, to protect artificial intelligence (AI) technology development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and Intellectual Property Department are seeking views on topics including copyright protection for AI-generated works, copyright infringement liability for AI-generated works, and the possible introduction of specific copyright exceptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The rapid advancement of AI technology, particularly generative AI, has induced revolutionary impacts on diverse domains and industries, as well as a number of copyright issues, arousing worldwide concerns,” a bureau spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The copyright regime is an important part of the intellectual property (IP) regime. On one hand, it protects the economic rights of creators in receiving remuneration from their fruits of creativity, and on the other hand, it properly balances the legitimate interests of copyright owners and the public interest," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National 14th Five-Year Plan set out how Hong Kong should be developed into a regional intellectual property trading centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A large-scale attraction featuring 36 popular animation characters has been installed on the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade, to promote animation development in Hong Kong and support local athletes at the upcoming Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AniCom Sports Park attraction links iconic local characters from different eras to various sporting events, including Old Master Q playing snooker, Dustykid rowing and Joe from the "City of Darkness" performing wushu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Wan, vice president of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation, said he hopes the attraction will further promote and develop animation as an art form in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People may not be familiar with our comic or animation characters, but we hope that people will want to take photos with them even if they don't know them. If they want to learn about the character's origin story, we have put QR codes alongside each installation so people can learn about the character and the artist's background," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to bring joy to people who see our installations. We also hope that through these characters, people can learn more about Hong Kong's animations and comics, which in turn brings more attention to the development of comics and animation in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The installations will be in place for the next two years.

    Public housing tenants face 10% rent increases

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760727_1_20240708164116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public housing tenants face a 10 percent increase in their rent, under a Housing Authority plan presented to Legco on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the increases will range from HK$49 to HK$572 per month, with the average amount at HK$230.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It slated October 1 as the date for the rises, but proposed a three-month exemption period meaning many tenants wouldn't pay any extra before January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said "well-off tenants" with income or assets exceeding certain thresholds would not be eligible for the exemption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the proposed rises would be affordable for tenants, with about 60 percent of them seeing a monthly increase of HK$250 or less.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For people who truly need help, we already have mechanisms in place to assist them. As for other tenants, we believe that an increase of HK$250 in monthly rents is affordable for them. This decision takes into account various considerations. We need to respect the mechanisms under our housing regulations," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority estimated that the proposed rent increases would generate additional revenue of around HK$2.3 billion per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the three-month waiver will cost the government HK$575 million in this financial year, the revenue increase would help narrow the authority's expected deficit to HK$591 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said poorer tenants would find the higher rents unaffordable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A majority of the grassroots class are living in public housing, especially the families who are only elderly or live alone. I mean the elderly just received a welfare (payment). So there's definitely no other choice and there's no opportunity to increase the income. For the grassroots class, especially the elderly family, that is not good news," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent.

    Govt says locals get priority for care home jobs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it anticipates a shortage of care home workers in future. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760723_1_20240708163026.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Monday dismissed a claim that the government is "replacing all local care home workers with imported staff".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The allegation came from Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker and executive councillor Stanley Ng, who complained that officials didn't discuss with unions a plan to bring in another 8,000 care home workers in the coming three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past year, 7,000 care workers were brought to Hong Kong under a special scheme for homes that failed to find local staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun told lawmakers that with an ageing population, the demand for care workers will only increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the quota under the import scheme might not be fully used if homes find local staff instead, adding that local workers will always be the main source of manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With reference to actual circumstances, we see or anticipate that there will be a wastage in the sector," Sun said at a Legco welfare services panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The age of existing workers is already quite old. If they retire, we cannot meet the service gap because we do not have as many youngsters as we want to join the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials are determined to make sure that local people have priority when it comes to employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a large-scale job fair will be held in September, with many non-governmental organisations operating care homes expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that the government will update the Labour Advisory Board about the special import scheme every six months.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An embankment seen as the second line of defence following a dyke breach in Hunan province was under threat on Monday, local authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 300 police officers and firefighters were working at the site to stem the piping effect that is eroding the embankment in Huarong County, said the province's water resources department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14.3km embankment is located around 2km behind the dyke that burst on Friday at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, following a heavy rainstorm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The piping effect can hollow out a dyke and lead to a burst if not properly handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 7,000 residents have been evacuated following the dyke burst on Friday, and workers have been racing against time to seal the 226m breach. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University (CUHK) on Monday said it will increase its scholarship funding by almost 90 percent from September, to just under HK$36 million in total.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New students admitted through JUPAS with Level 5** in seven or more subjects will be offered a one-off study allowance and exchange scholarship of HK$410,000, along with a full four-year tuition waiver, the university said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The maximum total value of the scholarship can be over HK$570,000, an increase of over HK$170,000 (approximately 44.6 percent) compared to last year. Adding with scholarships offered by colleges and faculties, the maximum scholarship value will be over HK$1 million."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that students with Level 5** in seven or more subjects who enrol in the six-year medical programme will be offered a full tuition waiver for an additional two years, with the maximum value of the scholarship increasing by around 18 percent to more than HK$660,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of admissions and financial aid Andy Wong said the plan was put in place even before the government recently announced an increase in university tuition fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Economic recovery after the pandemic has not been as ideal as expected. Many families have seen a significant drop in their income, and students are facing pressures of life and study. By significantly enhancing the scholarships, the university hopes that students will be able to focus on their studies without worrying," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university also said the scholarships will switch from annual renewals to one-off allowances, to give students "more flexibility in their arrangements and planning".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called on the international community to help Ukraine and Russia resume dialogue in a bid to resolve their conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi and visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis in talks in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban briefed Xi on his recent visits to Ukraine and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president stressed an early ceasefire and a political settlement are in the interests of all parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi called on the international community "to create conditions and provide support for the resumption of direct dialogue and negotiation between the two sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted him as saying that "only if all major countries inject positive rather than negative energy, can a ceasefire in this conflict emerge as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Russia and Ukraine, the end of the war “depends on the decision of three world powers, the United States, the European Union and China,” Orban wrote in a Facebook post showing him shaking hands with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Peace mission 3.0” is how Orban captioned a picture posted on the X social media platform depicting him after having stepped off his plane in Beijing earlier on Monday in this previously unannounced visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU at the start of July, and Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Orban had come to Moscow as a top representative of the European Council. Several top European officials dismissed that suggestion and said Orban had no mandate for anything beyond a discussion about bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi visited Hungary in May this year for the final leg of a European tour that also took him to France and Serbia. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Monday called on the government to regulate online car-hailing platforms and require their drivers to obtain permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTU lawmaker Michael Luk said taxi drivers have struggled to stay afloat in recent years due to competition with illegal cabbies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The taxi industry is facing a severe shortage of drivers, with 10 to 20 percent of taxis idle due to the unlicensed vehicles. Maybe some customers will choose other options," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luk said licensing online ride-hailing services wouldn't hurt the taxi trade and would lead to "fair competition".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think the ride-hailing services and the traditional taxis are [in conflict]. We think to get rid of the unlicensed vehicles... they can obtain more opportunities to develop the industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the lawmaker said officials can consider subsidising taxi drivers to buy fuel and insurance to minimise the impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, transport officials will brief lawmakers on the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday that he hopes two pandas given to Hong Kong as a present will arrive by National Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was in Sichuan to discuss the arrangements with mainland officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting a panda research centre in Dujiangyan with his wife, the CE saw a number of the animals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of them are super attractive. Male or female, some are strong, some are elegant. It appears they enjoy what they eat. I'm especially happy when I'm here at the centre," Lee told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe when the two giant pandas arrive in Hong Kong, members of the public will be as I am now... they'll feel excited and they'll find the pandas amiable. People will also want to get close to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said officials were still discussing the details regarding sending the pandas to Hong Kong.

    Far right blocked but stalemate looms in France

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of the leftist New Popular Front gather at the Place de la République in Paris to celebrate its strong showing in the polls. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760678_1_20240708123101.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France faced a hung parliament and the prospect of taxing negotiations to form a government, after a surprise left-wing surge blocked Marine Le Pen's quest to bring the far right to power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the dominant force in the National Assembly after Sunday's election, but with no single group securing a working majority the possibilities include the NFP forming a minority government or the building of a broad, unwieldy coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result delivered a stinging blow to President Emmanuel Macron and leaves the euro zone's second largest economy in limbo, heralding a period of political instability just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron ended up with a hugely fragmented parliament, in what is set to weaken France's role in the European Union and further afield, and make it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left won 182 seats, Macron's centrist alliance 168 and Le Pen's National Rally (RN) and allies 143, interior ministry data cited by Le Monde newspaper showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would tender his resignation, but it was not clear whether the president would accept it immediately, given the daunting task ahead to form a government. Attal said he would be willing to stay on in a caretaker role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will of course do my duties as long as it's needed – it cannot be otherwise on the eve of a date (the Olympics) that is so important for our country," Attal said as it became clear Macron's alliance had endured a humbling setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties from the NFP – made up of the French Communist Party, hard left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialist Party – met overnight for first talks on how to proceed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France Unbowed's firebrand leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said the new prime minister should hail from NFP. However, the bloc has no leader and its parties are strongly divided over who they could select as a suitable premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some prominent centrist figures, including Edouard Philippe, a former prime minister under Macron, said they were ready to work on a pact to ensure a stable government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The euro fell on Sunday after the vote projections were announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France's legislative ability," said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Le Pen's RN, the result was a far cry from weeks during which opinion polls consistently projected it would win comfortably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left and centrist alliances cooperated after the first round of voting last week by pulling scores of candidates from three-way races to build a unified anti-RN vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first reaction, RN leader Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's protege, called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a "disgraceful alliance" that he said would paralyse France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen, who will likely be the party's candidate for the 2027 presidential election, said however that Sunday's ballot, in which the RN made major gains compared with previous elections, had sown the seeds for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our victory has been merely delayed," she said. (Reuters)

    June hottest on record: EU climate monitor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest June on record across the globe, the EU's climate monitor said on Monday, capping half a year of wild and destructive weather from floods to heatwaves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record in a 13-month streak of unprecedented global heat, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is more than a statistical oddity and it highlights a large and continuing shift in our climate," said the service director, Carlo Buontempo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "inevitable" as long as humanity kept adding heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The global average temperature notched last month broke the previous June record set in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh high came at the midway point of a year marked by climate extremes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scorching heat has blanketed swathes of the world from India to Saudi Arabia, the United States and Mexico in the first half of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relentless rain, a phenomena scientists have also linked to a warmer planet, caused extensive flooding in Kenya, China, Brazil, Afghanistan, Russia and France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires have torched land in Greece and Canada and last week, Hurricane Beryl became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane on record as it barrelled across several Caribbean islands. (AFP)

    Japanese pay rises at its fastest pace in 31 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Base pay, or regular pay, rose an average 2.5 percent in May from a year earlier. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760662_1_20240708105146.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Average base pay for Japanese workers rose in May at its fastest pace in 31 years, data showed on Monday, a sign that bumper pay hikes offered by companies in annual wage negotiations are gradually being passed onto households.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But inflation-adjusted real wages fell for a record 26th straight month as a weakening yen and higher commodity prices pushed up the cost of imports, complicating the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) efforts to normalise monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Base pay, or regular pay, rose an average 2.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the fastest pace since January 1993, around the time when Japan's asset bubble burst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rise, which was bigger than a revised 1.6 percent gain in April, reflected hefty rises in monthly pay agreed by labour and management at annual labour negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data highlights Japan's increasing wage momentum. While real wages continue to fall, they will likely start rising in July," said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nominal wages, or the average total cash earnings per worker, grew 1.9 percent to 297,151 yen (US$1,850), accelerating from the previous month's 1.6 percent gain to mark the highest year-on-year increase in 11 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when adjusted for inflation, wages fell 1.4 percent in May after a revised 1.2 percent decline in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were signs that Japan's intensifying labour shortage is leading to broader-based wage rises. Wage hikes at firms with 30 or more employees outpaced inflation for the first time in 26 months, though when very small firms with five or more workers were included, pay hikes still lagged inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hourly pay for part-time workers rose 4.0 percent in May from a year earlier, outpacing a 2.7 percent gain for full-time staff. (Reuters)

    Workers at Samsung 'begin three-day strike'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Samsung is the world's largest memory chip maker, accounting for a significant chunk of global output of high-end chips. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760655_1_20240708100517.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Workers at South Korean tech giant Samsung began a three-day general strike Monday, the head of a union representing tens of thousands of employees told AFP, after talks with management broke down.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The strike has started from today," Son Woo-mok, head of the National Samsung Electronics Union, told AFP, adding that a major rally was scheduled later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union, which has around 28,000 members, or more than a fifth of the company's total workforce, announced the three-day general strike last week, saying it was a last resort after talks broke down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Management at the firm, the world's biggest producer of memory chips, has been locked in negotiations with the union over wages and benefits since January but the two sides have failed to narrow their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now at critical crossroads," the union said in an appeal sent out to members last week, urging them to support the "critical" strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This strike is the last card we can use," the union said, saying that workers at the company needed to "act as one".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This strike is not just about improving working conditions, it is about taking back our rights that have been ignored so far," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers have rejected the offer of a 5.1 percent pay hike, with the union having previously outlined demands including improvements to annual leave and transparent performance-based bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung declined a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung Electronics avoided its employees unionising for almost 50 years -- sometimes adopting ferocious tactics, according to critics -- while rising to become the world's largest smartphone and semiconductor manufacturer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Company founder Lee Byung-chul, who died in 1987, was adamantly opposed to unions, saying he would never allow them "until I have dirt over my eyes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first labour union at Samsung Electronics was formed in the late 2010s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm is the flagship subsidiary of South Korean giant Samsung Group, by far the largest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate business in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is world's largest memory chip maker, and accounts for a significant chunk of global output of the high-end chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung recently predicted a 15-fold increase in its on-year second quarter operating profits, thanks to growing demand for generative AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the global economy, used in everything from kitchen appliances and mobile phones to cars and weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And demand for the advanced chips that power AI systems has skyrocketed thanks to the success of ChatGPT and other generative AI products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductors are South Korea's leading export and hit US$11.7 billion in March, their highest level in almost two years, accounting for a fifth of South Korea's total exports, according to figures released by the trade ministry. (AFP)

    Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760649_1_20240708091647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said Hong Kong will surpass Switzerland to become the world's largest wealth management hub by 2027.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui said Hong Kong’s appeal in attracting foreign investments has been growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR will continue to improve service quality, noting that the government’s proposals to simplify the process of changing the place of incorporation to Hong Kong will attract overseas companies to establish or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On July 3, the government published new legislative proposals for a regulatory framework that makes it easier for overseas companies to re-domicile in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These proposals include relaxing the requirement for financial statement submission and extending the de-registration period from 60 to 120 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Hui said Hong Kong's attractiveness to foreign businesses would persist with its low tax rates and relaxed compliance requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In overseas jurisdictions, there have been more requirements for companies to register a place of incorporation. These requirements primarily focus on compliance, such as the need for local economic activities and specific operations. Some companies might enjoy lower compliance requirements or even lower tax rates in these places in the past,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the introduction of a global minimum tax rate and the rising compliance requirements, these incentives are dwindling. So, this has become a driving factor that encourages them to return to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stopped short on predicting the number of companies that would re-domicile to Hong Kong, but stressed a need to establish a suitable platform and framework in advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday he had arrived in Beijing on "Peace mission 3.0" after recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Orban was greeted at the airport by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, according to a photo he posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His arrival in Beijing follows surprise visits to Russia and Ukraine in the past week since Hungary took over the European Union's rotating presidency at the start of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban, the friendliest EU leader towards Moscow, held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday about the war in Ukraine during a trip criticised by both Kyiv and the EU, which said it threatened to undermine the bloc's stance on the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also came days before a Nato summit that will address further military aid for Ukraine against what the Western defence alliance has called Russia's "unprovoked war of aggression".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a short statement, the Foreign Ministry said the Hungarian leader would meet President Xi Jinping on Monday "for in-depth communication on issues of mutual interest".

 The Environmental Protection Department says it is investigating a fire on Sunday at a refuse reception centre on Stonecutters Island.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Firefighters had largely put out the blaze by 7 pm, after smoke had been reported in some of the waste about two hours' earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No injuries were reported and all employees were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre has temporarily suspended its operations and users have been told to use other collection points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it would work with the contractor and the Fire Services Department to investigate the cause of the fire. The department has also told the contractor to submit a report within seven days.
