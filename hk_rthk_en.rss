    <![CDATA[<img alt="Taxi drivers have apparently launched 'undercover operations' over unlicensed ride-hailing services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi drivers should not be going undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services and the matter should be left to the police, an industry spokesman said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Videos online appear to show cabbies travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, told RTHK he does not agree with such an approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added, however, that there were only 33 prosecutions over unlicensed ride-hailing services last year and the taxi trade is disappointed with the amount of action taken by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ride-hailing services are legal, but if these companies do not verify whether or not the cars in service have a hire car permit, the insurance of these cars already become invalid. This becomes a problem for all road users including third-party vehicles, pedestrians, passengers and even the driver of the ride-hailing car," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there is a serious accident and there's no compensation for casualties, people would criticise the SAR's governance and nobody wants to see that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow said he hopes plans for new fleets of taxis will improve services, leading to less demand for ride-hailing firms.

 China on Monday announced sanctions against three US defence companies for selling arms to Taiwan region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry placed General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Boeing Defence, Space & Security on its "unreliable entities list".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms will be barred from engaging in China-related import or export activities, and are forbidden to make new investments in China. In addition, senior executives of the companies are prohibited from entering China, while their work permits will be revoked, along with their visitor and residential status, and the related applications they submit will not be approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move is the latest in a series of sanctions Beijing has announced in recent years against defence companies for weapons sales to the island. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 11 rebounds and the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves overcame a 20-point, third-quarter deficit to beat the Denver Nuggets 98-90 in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Minnesota advances to the Western Conference finals for the first time in 20 years after winning in Denver for the third time in the series. The Timberwolves won Game 7 against the Sacramento Kings in 2004 to reach the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota, the No. 3 seed, hosts No. 5 Dallas in Game 1 on Wednesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 22 points and Anthony Edwards was 6-for-24 shooting but finished with 18 points, eight rebounds and seven assists to end the Nuggets' bid for a second straight NBA title. Rudy Gobert was big down the stretch, scoring eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nikola Jokic had 34 points and 19 rebounds and Jamal Murray scored 35 points for Denver. It is the second time in six seasons the Nuggets have lost a Game 7 at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota took its first lead since the first quarter on Rudy Gobert's floater early in the fourth quarter and stretched it 77-72. Jokic missed his first six 3-pointers but hit two from deep to keep the Nuggets close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naz Reid, who scored 11 points, hit two free throws, blocked Jokic's floater and had a putback dunk. Edwards drained a 3-pointer off a Murray turnover to put the Timberwolves ahead 92-82 with 3:07 left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denver closed within 93-88 with 1:02 left but Towns tip-in sealed Minnesota's trip to the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets staged a 16-0 run spanning the first and second quarters and led 53-38 at halftime. They pushed it to 58-38 early in the third and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a 17-footer that would have made it a 22-point lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves came storming back, using a 19-3 run to get within 61-57 with 3:05 left in the period. Towns hit a pair of free throws to get Minnesota within two, and Edwards drained a 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left to make it 67-66 heading into the fourth. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's state television said on Monday there was "no sign" of life among passengers of the helicopter which was carrying President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials.
 <br>
  <br>
   "Upon finding the helicopter, there was no sign of the helicopter passengers being alive as of yet," the TV report said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another official said that Raisi's helicopter was completely burnt in the crash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rescue teams had fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in East Azerbaijan province in the early hours of Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the head of Iran’s Red Crescent, Pirhossein Kolivand, told state TV: “We can see the wreckage and the situation does not look good.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A Turkish drone identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopter's wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said earlier on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian state news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China has said it was "deeply concerned" about Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi after his helicopter went down in what Tehran's state media described as an accident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Chinese side is deeply concerned about the hard landing of the helicopter in which President Raisi was travelling, and we wish President Raisi and the crew on board safe and sound," broadcaster CCTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying, adding that China would "provide all necessary support and assistance to the Iranian side in its rescue efforts".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expressions of concern and offers to help came from abroad, including Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Russia and Turkey, as well as from the European Union which activated its rapid response mapping service to aid in the search effort. (AFP/Reuters)

    Schauffele birdies final hole to win at Valhalla

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele birdied the final hole to win the PGA Championship by one shot over LIV Golf's Bryson DeChambeau at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday to claim his first major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Schauffele put the finishing touches on a wire-to-wire victory at the year's second major with a closing six-under-par 65 that left him at 21 under on the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Needing a closing birdie for the win, Schauffele's tee shot at the 18th perched up on the edge of a fairway bunker and forced him to take a compromised stance inside the hazard for his second shot, which he left just in front of the green.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele then displayed nerves of steel as he chipped to six feet from where he drained the biggest birdie of his career for the lowest winning score to par at a major championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau carded a bogey-free seven-under-par 64 to finish two shots ahead of Viktor Hovland [66], whose spirited effort to become the first Norwegian to win a major came undone at the final hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A day that began with seven players within four strokes of overnight co-leaders Schauffele and Collin Morikawa turned into a thrilling three-horse race across the back nine at Valhalla between Schauffele, DeChambeau and Hovland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau and Hovland were playing in the third-to-last pairing and each set up pressure-packed 10-foot birdie putts on the final hole. DeChambeau drained his but Hovland's effort curled away and he went on to make bogey and finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left the outcome in the hands of Schauffele, who was on the par-four 17th where he did well to save par after his tee shot caught a fairway bunker before sealing the deal at the 18th while DeChambeau watched it unfold on a nearby screen. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tyrese Haliburton reacts during the Pacers' win against the Knicks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753838_1_20240520080620.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tyrese Haliburton scored 26 points for the visiting Indiana Pacers, who rode a historic shooting performance to a 130-109 win over the New York Knicks in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series Sunday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indiana shot 67.1 percent (53-of-79) from the field – the highest shooting percentage ever in an NBA playoff game. They broke the previous record held by the 1990 Boston Celtics, who shot 67 percent [63-of-94] in a 157-128 win over the Knicks in a first-round game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers, who overcame series deficits of 2-0 and 3-2, will face the Boston Celtics in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals, scheduled to begin Tuesday night. This is the first trip to the conference finals for Indiana since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks, who played short-handed throughout the series and lost star point guard Jalen Brunson to a fractured left hand in the third quarter Sunday, fell short in their bid to appear in the conference finals for the first time since 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Nembhard and Pascal Siakam each scored 20 points while Aaron Nesmith had 19 points on 8-of-8 shooting for the Pacers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner scored 17 points while T.J. McConnell added 12 points off the bench. The 130 points were the most by a road team in a Game 7 in NBA history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donte DiVincenzo scored 39 points for the Knicks, who played the series without All-Star Julius Randle [out since January with a right shoulder injury]. Mitchell Robinson didn't play after Game 1 due to an aggravation of his left ankle injury while OG Anunoby missed the previous four games with a left hamstring before scoring five points in fewer than five first-quarter minutes Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart played 36-plus minutes Sunday despite an abdominal injury he suffered in Game 6 Friday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alec Burks had 26 points Sunday while Brunson had 17 points and nine assists. Hart tallied 10 points, eight rebounds and five assists before fouling out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks scored the first seven points of the third quarter to begin a 12-3 run that pulled them within 73-67 with 8:06 left. But Indiana answered with a 22-9 run and led by at least 13 throughout the fourth quarter. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain recalled its ambassador to Buenos Aires for consultations on Sunday after Argentina's President Javier Milei made derogatory comments about Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's wife during a far-right rally in Madrid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Milei had called Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez "corrupt" during a rally in Madrid organised by the far-right Vox party and attended by many of its international allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said he expected an apology from Milei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other ministers also condemned Milei's speech, in which he described socialism as "cursed and carcinogenic". Sanchez leads Spain's Socialist Party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With his behaviour, Milei has brought the relationship between Spain and Argentina to its most serious state in recent history," Albares said in a video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milei's visit broke with diplomatic protocol as he refused to meet Spain's King Felipe and Sanchez, instead preferring to promote his book alongside Vox leader Santiago Abascal at the party rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on social messaging app X that "attacks against family members of political leaders have no place in our culture".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party (PP), refused to support Madrid's stance, with party sources saying that Sanchez should have provided explanations about the alleged corruption case weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A city court said in April it was looking into accusations of influence peddling and business corruption against Sanchez's wife, brought in a private complaint by Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, an anti-corruption activist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Madrid's prosecuting authority later said it was appealing to have the case thrown out for lack of evidence. Sanchez decided to stay in office after five days of weighing his future once the probe against his wife was announced. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City won an unprecedented fourth straight English top flight title with a 3-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday to pip rivals Arsenal on the final day of a thrilling Premier League season as the fans turned the pitch into a sea of blue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two glorious early goals from league player of the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from Mohammed Kudus before halftime brought West Ham briefly into the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Rodri sealed the victory with a low 59th minute shot from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a phenomenal sixth title in seven years. Fans danced in their seats, belting out: "Champions again!" and "Are you watching Arsenal?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the closest title races in Premier League history, Arsenal could have taken the championship had City dropped points. But the Londoners' 2-1 win in their game against Everton was in vain, leaving them two points behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have the chance of winning the double as they face Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden's already brilliant season got even better when he arrowed the ball into the top corner in the second minute then capped a fine team move to sweep home the second in the 18th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so hard to put into words what we've done today," Foden said. "No team has ever done it. You see what it means to the fans and it means to us. Working all year for this moment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought today we just looked confident and just played our football and in the end it paid off."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder has scored 19 league goals this season and has won six Premier League titles at just 23, making him one of England's best hopes for this year's Euros in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the final whistle, the home fans poured onto the pitch, some letting off blue flares in celebration, while the players hugged each other in joy. (Reuters)

    Bezos' Blue Origin launches first flight since 2022

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ed Dwight, a former astronaut trainee, celebrates after the Blue Origin flight. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753820_1_20240520001226.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin launched a six-person crew – including the first US Black astronaut candidate from the 1960s – from West Texas to the edge of space on Sunday, resuming its centerpiece space tourism business for the first time since its suborbital New Shepard rocket was grounded in 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am ecstatic," Ed Dwight, who at age 90 years and eight months became the oldest person in space, said upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight and the other passengers, seated in a gumdrop-shaped capsule atop the rocket, were launched from Blue Origin facilities near the remote desert town of Van Horn. The rocket separated from the capsule, which then ascended further beyond the boundary of Earth's atmosphere to 105.7km, while the booster returned to land as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule then returned to Earth under parachutes, capping a mission lasting roughly 10 minutes. One of the capsule's three parachutes did not fully inflate, a hitch that may draw scrutiny before the rocket's next flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight was the first Black astronaut candidate who was picked by former US President John Kennedy in 1961 to train as an astronaut, but until now had never flown to space. Dwight stepped out of the capsule once it landed and thrust his fists into the air in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I really didn't need this in my life, but now I need it in my life," Dwight told a Blue Origin interviewer upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin has now flown 37 private astronauts, including in 2021 "Star Trek" star William Shatner, who was 90 years and six months old at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passengers, also including a venture capitalist and a pilot, were paying customers of Blue Origin's space tourism business, though Dwight's seat was sponsored by a space-focused nonprofit and a private foundation. Blue Origin has not disclosed how much it charges customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The grounding of New Shepard, Blue Origin's only active rocket, came after a mid-flight failure in September 2022 during an uncrewed research mission. A structural failure in the rocket's engine nozzle, the company concluded, forced the capsule full of science experiments to abort. (Reuters)

    Verstappen holds off Norris charge in Imola victory

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen held off a late charge by McLaren's Lando Norris to win the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix by less than a second on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's triple Formula One world champion took the chequered flag just 0.725 of a second ahead of the man who beat him at the previous round in Miami and sensed he might snatch another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Verstappen's fifth in seven races this season, the 59th of his career and the third edition in a row at Imola. Last year's race at the Italian circuit was cancelled due to heavy flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had no grip anymore. I was sliding a lot. I saw Lando closing in. The last 10 laps were flat out," said a relieved Verstappen, who had appeared set for another easy win but had to sweat ultimately for the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's difficult when the tyres were not working anymore and you have to go flat out. I couldn't afford to make too many mistakes. Luckily we didn't."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was third at the Italian team's atmospheric home track, 7.916 off the pace, for his fourth podium finish of the season and a home race to come in Monaco next weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory extended Verstappen's championship lead to 48 points, with Leclerc now his closest rival after Red Bull's Sergio Perez started 11th and finished only eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has 161 points, Leclerc 113 and Perez 107. Red Bull have 268 in the constructors' standings with Ferrari on 212 and McLaren on 154.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished fourth, after starting fifth due to a three-place grid penalty for impeding in qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fifth and the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell sixth and seventh on another afternoon to forget for the once-dominant team. (Reuters)

    Iran leader's helicopter crashes; fog hampers rescue

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ebrahim Raisi was reported to be onboard the helicopter that came down. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753814_1_20240519220926.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were struggling to reach the site of the incident.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were "at risk following the helicopter crash", which happened on the way back from a visit to the border with Azerbaijan in Iran's northwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State TV quoted an official as saying that at least one passenger and one crew member had been in contact with rescuers. It also said the helicopter had been found, though Iran's Red Crescent denied this report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian state media said bad weather was the cause of the crash and was complicating rescue efforts. The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all the resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guard to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is dark and it has started raining, but the search continues. Rescue teams have reached the area ... however, the rain has created mud, making the search difficult," a local reporter told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national broadcaster had earlier stopped all its regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country and, in a corner of the screen, live coverage of rescue teams deployed on foot in the mountainous area in heavy fog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rescue teams were expected to reach the probable site of the crash later on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neighbouring countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology to help Iran with the search.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tony Choi, who heads the Hong Kong Sports Institute, says he hopes Hong Kong can win medals in every Olympic Games from now on. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753787_1_20240519161207.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they have arrested two people on suspicion of vandalising a tombstone in Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to video circulating online, it belonged to Wong Ka-kui, the late singer of the now-disbanded musical band, Beyond.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video purportedly showed someone smashing the tombstone with a hammer, as well as spraying liquid and writing with a black marker on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the pair arrested are aged 15 and 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on social media, a former member of Beyond, Yip Sai-wing, called the incident "truly outrageous" and said anyone found guilty of carrying out the act must be punished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong died in 1993 at the age of 31.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Qijiguang bore a banner reading "Bring peace and friendship to meet good friends" as it approached the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint training is the naval component of the ongoing Golden Dragon exercises, which are regularly held between the two countries. (AP & AFP)

 Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong highly values Macau's position as an international metropolis and its cooperation with nearby Hengqin, Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said on Sunday as the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office wrapped up his week-long inspection trip to the gambling hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During his visit, Xia met representatives from various sectors, including healthcare, education and technology, to learn more about the latest social and economic developments in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said the senior Beijing official described Macau as "the apple of the motherland's eye" and stressed the need to use its advantages to build a "golden business card".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From my understanding, Director Xia's visit this time is to make an assessment of the current term of the SAR government. It's a great support for our work. They provide suggestions on areas where our work is insufficient," the Macau leader told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regarding our existing problems, they convey what the central government expects from us in meetings with executive, legislative and judicial bodies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Xia's second visit to Macau in as many years and came ahead of the 25th anniversary of the SAR's handover and a new term of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said Xia didn't mention the Macau CE election during the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, he emphasised a lot the 'golden business card' of Macau, and he also emphasised that Macau is now an international city, or an international cosmopolitan," Agnes Lam, associate professor at the University of Macau and a former lawmaker, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he didn't mention 'international' that many times last time. I think this is a new emphasis for Macau."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip, Xia visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and inspected a number of projects there, and Lam believes it shows the central government wants quicker integration of Macau and Hengqin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they urge the progress to be faster. This time, I think Director Xia also visited several key projects, including a residential project named Macau [New] Neighbourhood. And also he asked the whole society to support the government to speed up that project. So I think he also sent a stronger message about we should progress with that project."

    Turn Kai Tak Covid facility into arts &amp; sport hub: DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Sunday called on the government to transform the disused Covid isolation facility in Kai Tak into a base for the arts and sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, lawmaker Starry Lee said the facility, spanning around 80,000 square metres, has remained unused for a long time while incurring a monthly maintenance cost of HK$400,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now, we believe it is a good time to sort of restructure and reshape (it) as an international exchange art, sport hub, because this can leverage on the existing facility including the opening of the sport centre in Kai Tak area and also we have the cruise terminal," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are expecting more tourists to come through the cruise terminal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who represents the Kowloon Central geographical constituency, suggested the government develop a water sports centre, a dedicated space for youth art creation, as well as an exhibition area to showcase Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage within the Kai Tak complexes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said the transportation facilities in the Kai Tak area are inadequate, and called on the government to expedite the development of an eco-transportation system there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn told the Legislative Council that the government was considering turning the Covid-19 isolation facility in Kai Tak into a hub for the cultural and creative industries.

 China on Sunday launched an anti-dumping investigation into polyformaldehyde copolymer from the European Union, the United States, Taiwan region and Japan.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they have seized about 225 kilograms of suspected cocaine at a warehouse in Ta Kwu Ling and arrested two men.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said the haul had a market value of HK$204 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspected drugs were hidden among containers said to be carrying scrap iron and shipped from the South American country of Suriname.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers raided the warehouse in Ping Che on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our investigation reviewed that the drug-trafficking syndicate employed some, we believe, unwitting truck workers to assist them to dismantle approximately those 40 tonnes of scrap iron from the containers, with the syndicate overseeing the unloading,” superintendent Wilson Tam said in a press briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Subsequently, our officers conducted the raid, and we found two workers and arrested the other two suspected members of the drug syndicate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, aged 22 and 29, were held on suspicion of trafficking in dangerous drugs and will appear before Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam added that intelligence indicated the suspected drugs were being stored in Hong Kong before they were to be sold in other countries.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Student protesters have called for an end to the war in Gaza and for universities to divest. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753753_1_20240519102323.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Peaceful dialogue is the only way to address the concerns of students protesting around the world in solidarity with the people of Gaza amid the war between Israel and Hamas, a US economist and Columbia University scholar said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jeffrey Sachs made the remarks after pro-Palestinian protests that first began at Columbia University in New York City spread across some 140 campuses in the US, and subsequently reached Europe, Australia and India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been calls to stop the war and for universities to divest and cut ties with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are protests against an ongoing brutal war that Israel is waging in Gaza. And I think the protests in one form or another are going to continue and perhaps intensify if this war continues this way. So students are just seeing injustice and cruelty, and they are responding to it," Sachs told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while different schools have handled the protests in different ways, the use of violence to clamp down on demonstrators will only make matters worse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some universities responded very calmly, discussed with the students, the students appreciated the discussions, and the crisis was averted," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In other cases, the universities called in the police right away. And this escalated the tensions, and I think did unnecessary damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scholar highlighted the importance for school administrators to listen to the students and set up designated areas for demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Students want respect. They're open for discussion. Administrators are right to keep the universities properly functioning, but that leaves a lot of room for peaceful discussion, deliberation and agreements," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.

    Usyk takes undisputed title for first time in 25 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Oleksandr Usyk celebrates his points victory over Tyson Fury. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753745_1_20240519083939.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk beat Tyson Fury by split decision to win the world's first undisputed heavyweight championship on Sunday, an unprecedented feat in boxing's four-belt era.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Britain's Fury was the early aggressor but Usyk gradually took charge and the "Gypsy King" was saved by the bell in the ninth round before slumping to his first career defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Usyk joins the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight champion, the first since boxing recognised four major belts in the 2000s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the win, the still-undefeated former undisputed cruiserweight champion can legitimately claim to be the best of this era, although a rematch expected in October could provide another twist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a big opportunity for me, for my family, for my country," said Usyk, 37, who briefly served as a soldier after Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a great time, a great day," he said, adding that he was "ready for a rematch".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fury called it a "fantastic fight with Oleksandr".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I won that fight, I believe he won a few of the rounds, but I won the majority of them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know his country is at war, so people are siding with the country at war but make no mistake, I won that fight in my opinion and I will be back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Lennox Lewis was the last man to unify the heavyweight belts -- three at the time -- after beating Evander Holyfield in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two judges scored it for Usyk by scores of 115-112 and 114-113 while the third gave it to Fury 114-113. The victory extended Usyk's professional record to 22-0. After his first loss, Fury stands at 34-1-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk, who adds Fury's WBC belt to his IBF, WBA and WBO titles, looks set to go down as one of the greats after dominating at amateur, cruiserweight and now the top division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fired-up Fury came running out of his corner to start the fight and the 2.06 metre boxer was quickly into his rhythm, keeping the shorter Usyk back with his jab and playing to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk got inside with some quick combinations while Fury landed some heavy body shots. By round four, the Mancunian was taunting his ever-advancing opponent and showboating, guard down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk called two low shots in round five and got caught with a left hook as Fury continued to look comfortable, landing a telling uppercut in the following round and bobbing and weaving to stay out of range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Ukrainian tagged Fury with two clean lefts in the seventh and landed a punishing hook that dazed the "Gypsy King" in the eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the next round, a relentless Usyk barrage had Fury in serious trouble and the wobbling, bleeding Mancunian took a standing count before being saved by the bell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fury recovered his poise and with the match in the balance heading into the final round, both fighters were finding the target.
  <br/>

  Wladimir Klitschko was among the legends watching along with Saudi-based football stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, who like boxing are grateful beneficiaries of the oil-rich monarchy's lavish push into sports. (AFP)

    Lowry matches Schauffele's record PGA round

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry matched the lowest round in major golf history on Saturday, shooting a nine-under par 62 in the third round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Irishman tied the mark achieved four prior times, most recently in Thursday's first round by Xander Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other 62s were made by Schauffele and fellow American Rickie Fowler in the first round at last year's US Open and the 2017 British Open by South African Branden Grace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bogey-free round left Lowry, the 2019 British Open winner, on 13-under par 200 for 54 holes, one stroke behind leader Schauffele, who was still on the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry birdied eight of the first 14 holes at Valhalla to reach 12-under and briefly share the lead, sinking birdie putts of 37 feet at 13 and 32 feet at the par-3 14th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He fired 29 on the front nine with birdies on six of the first nine holes, four of those between 13 and 19 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Lowry sank a birdie putt from just beyond six feet at the par-4 17th, there was a buzz around the course as he walked to the par-5 finishing hole, one softened and more receptive after rain earlier this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 18, Lowry's tee shot found the left rough and his second shot landed in the left rough, but his third drew wild applause, setting him up for a birdie putt from just inside 12 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry's bid to make the first 61 in major championship history missed but he tapped in for 62 and a share of history. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefighters were called to a chemical leak in Yuen Long in the early hours of Sunday, with people in the area urged to close their windows.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The incident involved oil tanks on Wang Lok Street, and Fire Services Department officers were called in just before 1am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Members of the public who are being affected by the smoke and an unusual odour carried by the wind are advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm," a government statement said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz demanded on Saturday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commit to an agreed vision for the Gaza conflict that would include stipulating who might rule the territory after the war with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gantz told a press conference he wanted the war cabinet to form a six-point plan by June 8. If his expectations are not met, he said, he will withdraw his centrist party from the conservative premier's broadened emergency coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz, a retired top Israeli general who opinion polls show is Netanyahu's most formidable political rival, gave no date for the prospective walkout but his challenge could increase strains on an increasingly unwieldy wartime government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu appears outflanked in his own inner war cabinet, where he, Gantz and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant alone have votes. On Wednesday, Gallant demanded clarity on post-war plans and for Netanyahu to forswear any military reoccupation of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the prime minister were to do that, he would risk angering ultra-nationalist coalition parties that have called for Gaza to be annexed and settled. Losing them could topple Netanyahu, who before the war failed to enlist more centrist partners, given his trial on corruption charges he denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personal and political considerations have begun to penetrate the Holy of Holies of Israel's national security," Gantz said. "A small minority has seized the bridge of the Israeli ship and is piloting it toward the rocky shoal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz said his proposed six-point plan would include bringing a temporary US-European-Arab-Palestinian system of civil administration for Gaza while Israel retains security control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also institute equitable national service for all Israelis, including ultra-Orthodox Jews, who are now exempted from the military draft and have two parties in Netanyahu's coalition determined to preserve the waiver. (Reuters)

    Verstappen ties Senna record with Imola pole

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull's Max Verstappen equalled Ayrton Senna's record of eight pole positions in a row with the fastest lap in qualifying for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The late Brazilian's run was set in 1988/89 with McLaren and Verstappen, also a triple Formula One world champion, started his sequence in Abu Dhabi at the end of last season and has yet to be out-qualified in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's 39th career pole came as Formula One marks 30 years since Senna, who had 65 poles, died in a crash at the Italian circuit on May 1, 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a great start to the year and very special," said the Dutch driver after also matching Alain Prost's record 1993 seven successive poles at the start of a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's 30 years since he (Senna) passed away, so very pleased to get pole and in a way it's a nice memory to him. He was an incredible F1 driver, especially in qualifying," added Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri joined the championship leader provisionally on the front row, with stewards investigating the Australian for possibly impeding Haas's Kevin Magnussen in the first phase of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris, a first time winner at the previous race in Miami, qualified third for McLaren with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completing the second row at the Italian team's home circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are getting closer. To be ahead of Ferrari is also a nice result for us," said Norris. "It's going to be close, it's going to be a good race tomorrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully it's an exciting one. Tough, especially when the lap times are so tight. A lot of it is down to lap one, strategy and the pit stops." (Reuters)

    Coach De Zerbi to depart Brighton

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Roberto De Zerbi is on his way out of Brighton. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753724_1_20240518231611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton & Hove Albion coach Roberto De Zerbi will leave the club after their final match of the season against Manchester United, the Premier League club said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  De Zerbi joined Brighton in September 2022 when he replaced Graham Potter and made an instant impact when he secured their highest top-flight finish (sixth) and helped them qualify for European competition for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season, Brighton reached the last 16 of the Europa League but struggled in the Premier League where they are 10th going into the final day of the season on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Roberto has given us two excellent seasons of service in which he has led the club to new heights, not least our first ever European campaign which will live long in the memory of Albion fans," club chairman Tony Bloom said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have mutually agreed to end Roberto's contract at a time that suits both parties allowing us the earliest opportunity to plan for next season, and Roberto plenty of time to consider his next move and his future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian manager earned plaudits for an entertaining brand of football based on possession while he also nurtured young talents who were able to thrive in his system even as the club lost major players to bigger teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very sad to be leaving Brighton, but I am very proud of what my players and staff have achieved with the support of everyone at the club and our amazing fans in the past two historical seasons," De Zerbi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have really enjoyed an intense and challenging two years working in the Premier League, not least competing in four major competitions this season. Leaving now provides me with time to take a break before deciding on my future plans." (Reuters)

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753723_1_20240518231332.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has announced that she has vetoed a draft law on foreign agents, Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zourabichvili had said previously that she would veto the bill, which has sparked street protests, but her decision can be overridden by another vote in parliament, controlled by Georgia's ruling party and its allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I vetoed a Russian law. This law is Russian in its essence and spirit," Tass quoted her as telling a briefing. "It contradicts our constitution and all European standards, therefore it represents an obstacle to our European path."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tass quoted the president as saying her veto was legally competent, and that it would be handed over to parliament on Saturday. "This law must be repealed," it quoted her as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, is, however, widely expected to overturn the veto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mass protests have swept through the Georgian capital Tbilisi over the past month since the first reading of the draft law was passed in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, imposing disclosure requirements and fines for violations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opponents see the bill as a test of whether the country stays on a path towards integration with Europe or pivots back towards Russia. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Jockey Club on Saturday announced that it's boosting the prize fund for special Snowball draws in its Mark Six lottery, making the big-money jackpots more frequent and larger.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club said it would start the new arrangements from Tuesday's draw, with more money being held back for the Snowball. It says the number of Snowball draws will rise from about seven per year to 12, while the top prize will be up to HK$100 million for some draws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club said in a statement: "The Snowball draw is a major attraction of the Mark Six."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club said the minimum prize for regular draws would remain unchanged at HK$8 million, while other variable and fized prize allocations would also stay the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the majority of lottery revenue after payouts goes on benefitting the Hong Kong community, with 40 percent of lottery turnover going on taxes or into the lotteries fund.

    Truck driver arrested over light rail incident

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested a truck driver on suspicion of causing a light rail carriage to derail, and disrupting light rail services in the western New Territories for about three hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is suspected that a plank, measuring 50 centimetres by 20 centimetres, fell from the truck the man was driving onto the light rail tracks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers arrested the 49-year-old man for alleged dangerous driving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident occurred at around 9:40am, when a carriage derailed near Chung Uk Tsuen Station and affected light rail routes 610, 614, 615, and 715.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, services were suspended at Lam Tei, Nai Wai, Chung Uk Tsuen and Hung Shui Kiu stations. But there were no injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR Corporation said it's investigating the incident, adding a preliminary investigation found that the train involved was not speeding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing sources, lawmaker Gary Zhang, the deputy chairman of the subcommittee on matters relating to railways at the Legislative Council, said the incident happened at a busy crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Although the incident is unrelated to the operations and maintenance of the light rail services, I think the MTR Corporation can still use technology to prevent similar incidents from happening again. For example, they can consider installing AI cameras at its junctions, or maybe install some vehicle-based detection systems so that early detections can be done,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang doesn't expect the incident to trigger any penalty mechanisms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the city’s transport chief Lam Sai-hung said that he had expressed concern about the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has conducted an immediate investigation at the scene of the incident and will study improvement measures along with the MTR Corporation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday said there are more companies than ever in Hong Kong, which shows that the city is a vibrant, reliable and convenient place to do business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said there are over 1.43 million local companies and around 15,000 non-local firms as of April - both record high figures for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said new companies were emerging, outnumbering those that folded by about 4,600 last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, it said the number of bankruptcy and winding up petitions fell in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities received 742 bankruptcy and 66 winding up petitions last month. The figures were slightly lower than those in March, but still at least 30 percent up from a year ago.

    'Double peak flu seasons' by two virus strains: doctor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An infectious disease expert on Saturday warned that Hong Kong could be hit by a double whammy in which its peak influenza seasons are dominated by two flu virus strains - one after another this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ivan Hung, who's also a professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that influenza virus infections have rebounded to a relatively high level recently, as residents have low immunity to influenza after three years of the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the peak flu season dominated by the A subtype H3 virus strain ended last October, infections have continued this year and the SAR also has to contend with a peak season dominated by the A subtype H1 flu virus strain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In January we have already had the influenza peak season for the subtype H3 virus, and then starting in April and May, we had the peak season that's dominated by the subtype H1 virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While the H1 virus-led inflections might ease from June and July, there's a chance that we might see the H3 virus making a comeback to form another small peak season from August and September,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think overall, the H3 virus-dominated peak season might be less serious compared with the one seen last year,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The infectious disease expert again called on parents to take their children to get a flu vaccine shot prior to the summer vacation, as there were many serious cases of children infected by the subtype H1 virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the city’s Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases had recommended that the Department of Health increase the procurement of the nasal vaccine to raise vaccination rates, as young children were more willing to receive the nasal vaccine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Hung predicted that the new Covid variant - KP.2 strain - that was discovered in the city’s sewage system, will replace the current prevalent variant - JN.1 - as the dominant Covid strain. But he said the new variant will not cause severe cases.

    Cash-strapped arts hub warns of opening restrictions

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The cash-strapped West Kowloon Cultural District on Saturday said the M+ and palace museums may have to restrict the days on which they open unless the government replies promptly to its financial proposals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, who chairs the cultural district authority's board, told i-Cable News that they have already handed in plans as to what to do when the authority's funds are drained next year, but the administration has not responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the government should have also completed a study into the authority's finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the arts hub will run out of money in June 2025, and that it's now taking loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the government delays [giving us a reply], we'll need to take big steps to cut costs. For example, the museums might just open four days a week, instead of six. The Xiqu centre may also open on fewer days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But will this be fair to the public? After all, this is not a commercial undertaking but a key public policy project."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added that restricting the days the facilities open will also go against the national policy to establish Hong Kong as a hub for cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had earlier told local newspapers that they did not wish to request more public money, but could shore up the cultural quarter's finances by selling part of its 40 hectares of land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a decision on their funding proposal will have to be made by June to enable contracts to be signed for new exhibitions and projects.

    'Govt poverty alleviation strategy not precise'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Social welfare lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen on Saturday criticised the government’s latest strategy to ease poverty by saying that such strategies are not “precise” or “accurate” in alleviating poverty as they did not include other groups that also require social support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came after authorities earlier identified around 950,000 elderly people, single parent households, and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tik said the latest strategy could not comprehensively reflect the city’s poverty situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not against having these target groups, but I think there aren't enough targeted groups, because there are also the disabled, the chronically ill, the mentally ill, and so on. So I think it's not 'broad' enough in terms of identifying the families who need key assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Secondly, the targeted groups are also not 'precise' enough, as it's very general to say that there are over 900,000 people [in these groups], but what about different levels… within them?” he commented, adding that the strategy is not “accurate”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislator also believes that the government must maintain and improve the so-called “poverty line”, instead of “abandoning” the gauge, as it could reflect whether those targeted measures to tackle poverty are having an effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The poverty line uses Hong Kong median household income as the sole gauge to measure poverty. The government earlier said such a gauge is no longer appropriate, and it will come up with a more accurate way of monitoring poverty levels later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The latest strategy is target group-based, and the poverty line is income-based, these two have different calculation methods and are not comparable,” Tik noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, which represents some 480 non-governmental social services organisations, said some government-led projects to tackle poverty aren't effective enough in offering help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He cited the “Strive and Rise Programme” the government set up as an example and said that such a project, despite having positive feedback in recent times, is only supporting a limited number of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There were about 2,000 pupils covered in the previous cohort under the programme, and about 4,000 covered in the current cohort. All these numbers are far [smaller] compared with poverty figures showing tens of thousands," Chua told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme cited was aimed at addressing inter-generational poverty issues by pairing under-privileged students with volunteer mentors - along with financial support:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government might need to explain to the public why the number of assisted pupils is so small?” he asked.

    Taxi industry has got to change: transport minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said future taxi fleets will have to allow digital payments, install video recording technology, and should respond to complaints.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam told a Commercial Radio programme that he hopes this government initiative to step up taxi management will enhance service standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the fleet management will... shift the culture of the whole taxi industry, because we have got to change. If we go on like this, the taxi industry will just get worse and people will have less and less confidence in it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said applications for taxi fleet licences are closing at the end of the month, and the licences will be issued in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fleets should start operating within a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said the upcoming taxi fare hike is needed so the industry can stay financially sustainable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said taxi drivers earned HK$17,000 to HK$20,000 a month on average last year, and some of them had seen their income fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After taking into account inflation, some taxi drivers - for example those working on Lantau - earned a lower income than they did in 2019. We think this isn't good for the taxi sector's long term development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cost of gas and insurance have also gone up. We considered these factors before reaching the decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said they had also considered if people would accept a fare hike, before announcing that flagfall for all taxis will rise by HK$2 from July 14.

    SAR's health sector needs to be 'innovation driver'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau (left) is upbeat on the prospects for the SAR's health and dental sector - as long as it continues to innovate. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753668_1_20240518104520.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau said on Saturday that he's confident that Hong Kong's high quality healthcare and dental services will remain competitive, even though some local patients have been heading north for services on the mainland that are cheaper.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said while some patients think the mainland offers better value-for-money services, the SAR has nothing to worry about so long as the profession keeps improving its services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lo said on RTHK's Your Home Address programme that as the government seeks to develop the SAR as an international health and medical innovation hub, Hong Kong can also drive advancement in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has excellent health care service and we have a wonderful university here with a medical school and a dental school. We're not just good in providing service, we should be good in innovation as well," the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we are good, we have all the talents, enough talents, we should actually not be looking just at providing services. We should be driving, we should be the driver for innovation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary noted that a Hospital Authority initiative to offer medical staff low-interest home loans to retain talent has been going well, with some 80 percent - or more than a thousand applications approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo expressed the hope that upcoming legal changes that would allow more non-locally trained healthcare professionals to practice in the SAR will help ease the staffing shortage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow Jones finished above 40,000 points for the first time on Friday, as stocks were mixed on Wall Street at the end of the trading week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to finish at 40,003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 percent at 5,303, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,685.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the slight decline in the Nasdaq, all three major indexes still finished the week higher than they were at the start of it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We made a breakout to new record high," said Karl Haeling from LBBW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The market is just choosing to consolidate, which is probably a healthy thing," he continued. "Because it's racing and getting too exuberant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, petrochemical producer Valero Energy finished the day up 4.8 percent, while the mining company Freeport McMoRan was up 4.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the day's big losers was Paramount Global, which saw its share price fall 4.9 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who attacked the elderly husband of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a hammer was jailed on Friday for 30 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  David DePape was convicted last year of breaking into the couple's San Francisco home and bludgeoning Paul Pelosi, who is 84.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the time of the October 2022 attack, Democrat Nancy Pelosi was second in line to the presidency and a regular target of far-right conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jurors heard how DePape – a Canadian former nudist activist who supported himself with occasional carpentry work – had initially planned to target Nancy Pelosi, planning to smash her kneecaps if she did not admit to her party's "lies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nancy Pelosi was not at home the night of the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors had asked the federal court in San Francisco to sentence DePape to 40 years in prison. (AFP)

    Police arrest golf world No1 Scheffler at Valhalla

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scottie Scheffler had his mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit, was released, then taken back to the course for breakfast and practice, before finally teeing off. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753637_1_20240518030917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Golf world number one Scottie Scheffler was handcuffed and arrested by police early on Friday after allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while trying to avoid traffic controls outside the PGA Championship at Valhalla.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In one of the strangest scenes ever at a major tournament, Scheffler was taken into custody by police, booked with a mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit, released, then taken back to the course for breakfast and practice before finally teeing off in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was detained by Louisville Metro police after he drove onto curbing to try and get around an accident at the entrance of the golf course, one that resulted in the fatality of a pedestrian, and was confronted by police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic and released on his own recognisance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While on the driving range preparing to tee off, Scheffler released a statement about the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers," Scheffler said. "It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never intended to disregard any of the instructions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today. Of course, all of us involved in the tournament express our deepest sympathies to the family of the man who passed away in the earlier accident this morning. It truly puts everything into perspective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police report on the incident obtained by ESPN said arresting officer Bryan Gillis says Scheffler disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging the officer to the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gillis was hospitalised with pain, bruising and swelling in his left wrist and knee. An arraignment is set for Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time Masters champion Scheffler arrived at Valhalla's clubhouse about 30 minutes after his release and just under an hour before his start time off the 10th tee in the second round, which began after an 80-minute delay due to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were devastated to learn that a worker with one of our vendors was tragically struck and killed by a shuttle bus outside Valhalla Golf Club," the PGA of America said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is heartbreaking to all of us involved with the PGA Championship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was driven, by the owner of Valhalla Golf Club according to ESPN, to the clubhouse, where he ate breakfast and changed into his golf apparel before going to the practice range to prepare for his round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a tough deal," said Scheffler playing partner Brian Harman, the 2023 British Open winner. "But I'm glad to see him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans cheered as Scheffler walked through the rain onto the par-5 10th tee and gave him a huge ovation just before he struck his first shot into the right rough on his way to an opening birdie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, who won his second Masters title last month, is trying to become the first player since 2015 to win the first two majors in a calendar year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio reported Scheffler was booked into custody by police at 7:38 a.m. before Scheffler's mugshot in an orange jumpsuit was posted by the Louisville Metropolitan Department of Corrections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ESPN's Jeff Darlington posted a video on X of Scheffler, wearing shorts and T-shirt, with his hands held behind his back, being led away by police in the pre-dawn incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darlington said Scheffler was unaware a person at the entrance was a police officer because they were clad in a yellow rain poncho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was the feel-good story of the week at Valhalla, hoping to win his third career major title a week after becoming a father for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His wife, Meredith, gave birth to son Bennett nine days ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler fired a four-under par 67 in Thursday's opening round, but began Friday five strokes adrift of leader Xander Schauffele, the world number three who matched the lowest round in major golf history with a 62 Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, 27, has won four of his past five starts, capturing titles at Bay Hill and the Players in March, losing in a playoff at the Houston Open, then winning the Masters and Heritage crowns last month. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Last season Arne Slot guided Feyenoord to just their second league title in 24 years. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753629_1_20240518005501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord coach Arne Slot confirmed on Friday that he would be replacing Jurgen Klopp as manager of Liverpool next season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There hasn't be an official announcement yet – but I don't think it will come as news to you that I will be coach there next season," Feyenoord boss Slot told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK media said last month that Slot's deal to replace Klopp was worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season before penning a new three-year deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp will step down at the end of this season after a nine-year reign which brought the Champions League title in 2019 and Premier League trophy a year later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initially, Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite to succeed Klopp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said on Friday that troops had recovered the bodies of three hostages in the war-torn Gaza Strip who had been "murdered" by their captors on October 7.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Last night, the Israel Defence Forces (army) rescued the bodies of our hostages Shani Louk, Amit Buskila and Itzhak Gelerenter," military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli citizens "were taken hostage during the Hamas massacre on October 7 and murdered" during the bloody attack on the Nova music festival, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the festival, which was held near the Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fighters from Palestinian militant group Hamas crossed over and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This terrible loss is heart-breaking... We will return all of our hostages, the living and the deceased alike," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement after the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the around 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 125 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has launched a retaliatory offensive against Hamas that has killed at least 35,303 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hostages Families Forum said the recovery of the bodies was a "painful and stark reminder that we must swiftly bring back all our brothers and sisters from their cruel captivity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louk, a 22-year-old Israeli-German dual national, was identified in online videos showing a woman lying face down in the back of a pick-up truck filled with armed men, before being announced dead later in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last sign of life of Buskila, who was also captured while partying at the festival, was a call to her uncle Shimon, who heard his niece beg her kidnappers not to take her away. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations warned on Friday that it had only received 12 percent of the US$2.7 billion being sought for war-wracked Sudan, adding that "famine is closing in."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced in Sudan since war broke out in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations says more than 1.4 million people have fled the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a catastrophically underfunded appeal," Jens Laerke, spokesman for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without more resources coming in fast, humanitarian organisations won't be able to scale up in time to stave off famine and prevent further deprivation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Sudan, half of the population, 25 million people, need humanitarian aid. Famine is closing in. Diseases are closing in. The fighting is closing in on civilians, especially in Darfur."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations has expressed growing concern in recent days over reports of heavy fighting in densely populated areas as the RSF seeks control of El-Fasher, the last major city in the western Darfur region not under its control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time for donors to make good on pledges made, step up and help us help Sudan and be part of changing the current trajectory that's leading toward the cliff's edge. Don't be missing in action," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shible Sahbani, the UN's World Health Organisation representative in Sudan, said: "Thirteen months of war in Sudan, nine million people displaced which represent around 17 percent of the population and the largest internal displacement crisis in the world today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This conflict has... nearly destroyed the health system which is almost collapsed now. Close to 16,000 people have died due to this war, 33,000 have been injured," she said, speaking from Port Sudan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sahbani said the real toll was "probably much higher."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF and Sudan's armed forces are seen as both wanting to secure a battleground victory and each side has received support from outside players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN human rights chief Volker Turk this week separately spoke to Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, president of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, Commander of the Rapid Support Forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He urged them both to act immediately - and publicly - to de-escalate the situation," UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. (AFP)

    WHO says no medical aid received in Gaza for 10 days

    <![CDATA[<img alt="WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, (far left), says the biggest concern is over the fuel needed to keep clinics and hospitals running. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753622_1_20240517225724.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation said on Friday that it has received no medical supplies in the Gaza Strip for 10 days as Israel pursues a new offensive against Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's closure of the Rafah crossing into Gaza has caused "a difficult situation," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. "The last medical supplies that we got in Gaza was before May 6."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli troops entered the city of Rafah on May 7 to extend their offensive against Hamas over the militant group's attacks seven months earlier. They closed the Rafah crossing into Egypt that is crucial for humanitarian supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With UN agencies warning of a growing risk of famine in Gaza, the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings from Israel are also virtually shut down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jasarevic said the biggest concern was over fuel needed to keep clinics and hospitals running. Gaza's health facilities need up to 1.8 million litres of fuel a month to keep operating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said only 159,000 litres had entered Rafah since the border closure. "This is clearly not sufficient," he added, highlighting how only 13 out of 36 hospitals across the Palestinian territory were now "partially" operating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals still functioning are running out of fuel, and that puts so many lives at danger," said Jasarevic. "Current military operations in Rafah are putting countless lives at risk."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the death of more than 1,170 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures. Out of 252 people taken hostage, 128 are still held inside Gaza, but the army says 38 have died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 35,300 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the war broke out, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza. (AFP)

    E-CNY pilot scheme expanded to HK for the first time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.

<div class="itemFullText">
 French authorities said police on Friday shot dead a man armed with a knife and a crowbar who was trying to set fire to a synagogue in the northern city of Rouen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "National police in Rouen neutralised early this morning an armed individual who clearly wanted to set fire to the city's synagogue," Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources told French media the man "was armed with a knife and an iron bar, he approached police, who fired. The individual died."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local officials said there were no victims other than the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The synagogue stands in the historic centre of the city, the capital of the northern region of Normandy that lies along the River Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two separate investigations have been opened, one into the fire at the synagogue and another into the circumstances of the death of the man killed by the police, Rouen prosecutors said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an investigation by French authorities is automatic whenever an individual is killed by the police. (AFP)

    Timberwolves crush Nuggets, force Game 7

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Minnesota Timberwolves overwhelmed the Denver Nuggets 115-70 to force the defending NBA champions to a decisive game seven in their Western Conference semifinal series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards shook off an injury scare to finish with 27 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals as the young, hungry Timberwolves fended off elimination against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets, who had won the previous three games to take charge of the best-of-seven series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 21 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Minnesota finished with a 62-43 advantage in rebounds and the Timberwolves reserves outscored the Nuggets bench 36-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets will host the winner-take-all game seven on Monday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super-pumped for it," 22-year-old Edwards said of the chance to eliminate the Nuggets on their home floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But McDaniels cautioned that the Nuggets would be ready as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not over," McDaniels said. "We're just going to try to keep this intensity for the next game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall, the Timberwolves absorbed an early punch, falling behind 9-2 before exploding for a 20-0 scoring run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They out-scored the Nuggets 31-14 in the first quarter, dominating in the paint and winning the rebounding battle 19-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denver went nearly six minutes without scoring, the crowd at the Target Center in Minneapolis growing more frenzied as the Timberwolves' lead grew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another surge by Denver to open the second quarter was quickly repelled with a 13-0 Minnesota run that featured back-to-back baskets from Naz Reid and a three-pointer from Edwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every time the Nuggets looked to be gaining momentum Minnesota responded -- their energy rewarded once again as McDaniels grabbed the rebound from a Reid miss for a second-chance basket at the halftime buzzer, giving the Timberwolves a 59-40 lead at the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was pleased with a bounce-back performance from his team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were two responses," Finch said. "There was the response to the last three games, but the most important response was when we got down 9-2. And we did a really good job of focusing and coming back with the right energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards said he banged his tailbone, but would be ready for Game 7. (AFP)

    Putin in trade push on final day of China trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Harbin on Friday to promote trade ties between the two nations on the final day of his state visit in China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lying just a few hundred kilometres from the border with Russia, Harbin has long served as a key hub for cross-border trade and cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian president attended the opening ceremony of a China-Russia trade expo and was accompanied by Vice President Han Zheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the ceremony, Putin hailed energy ties between the two countries and promised to "strengthen" them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Russia is ready and able to continuously power the Chinese economy, businesses, cities and towns with affordable and environmentally clean energy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the world is on the threshold of the next technological revolution, we are determined to consistently deepen bilateral co-operation in the field of high technologies and innovations," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday on his first trip abroad since his March re-election, meeting President Xi Jinping for talks in which the leaders framed their nations' ties as a stabilising force for the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two men later ditched their ties for a less formal meeting over tea at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Footage from broadcaster CCTV also showed the leaders embracing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An editorial in the Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties between the two countries, saying China had been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 straight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavourable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship," the editorial said. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer who was earlier found guilty of mortgage fraud involving more than HK$26 million was sentenced on Friday to six and a half years in jail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Superintendent Harbour Chan was convicted in April of two counts of fraud in connection with two mortgage applications made in 2019 involving a luxury house in Tai Po and a flat in Tung Chung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Co-defender former chief inspector Wong Ho-ngai was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for one count of fraud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mitigation, Chan's lawyer requested the court to consider an appropriate reduction in sentence given that the defendant grew up in a less privileged family and his enthusiasm in participating in public welfare activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy District Judge Edward Wong said the sentencing starting points for the two charges were set at six and a half years and three and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Considering the defendant's good personal background and special social contributions, a discretionary reduction in sentence was granted, resulting in a sentence of six and a half years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)

    Govt greenlights San Tin environmental study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said it has given conditional approval to the environmental study into a plan to turn fish ponds in the northern New Territories into a technology hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department's director, Samuel Chui, said the environmental impact assessment on the San Tin Technopole project took into account a large number of ecological survey findings, and officials did not receive any feedback concerning issues the report did not cover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The report is scientific, professional and comprehensive. And it doesn't underestimate the ecological value of the area being studied," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui added that amendments to the report submitted by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), such as birds' names and photos as well as a draft plan to create habitats for animals, did not affect the effectiveness of the study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said conditions for the approval include that the CEDD has to submit detailed designs for the project and that it must refrain from filling in fish ponds in the area before creating a new one in a conservation park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the CEDD also needs to set up a panel, consisting of green group members and government representatives, to monitor the development's impact on the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The committee will work together to give the best environmental protection," he said. "Just like this time, we have heard many proposals and we will discuss and find the best way to protect the environment and also to conserve the species and the ecology in the area."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the CEDD is taking measures to protect Eurasian Otters, a species of conservation importance. The animals were recorded back in 2019, but were not found during a recent ecological survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the department is adopting suggestions from green groups on building passages for the otters, as well as improving the design of buildings so birds will not crash into them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau, for its part, welcomed the approval, saying it provides a solid foundation for the government to proceed with the next stage of the town planning process and commence the project as scheduled.

    Surveyors suggest ways to improve subdivided units

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kenny Tse (right) says owners bear the responsibility of improving subdivided units as they are earning money from them. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753545_1_20240517133008.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A minimum area of at least 100 square feet, including the toilet and kitchen, as well as ensuring proper ventilation and drainage, were among the recommendations made by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors in its report to a government task force on subdivided units.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Various fire protection measures should also be implemented, the institute noted, including no open flame cooking, partition walls installed between units that could block fire for at least one hour, as well as providing a clear fire escape route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other recommendations include having at least one openable window towards open space and separating the kitchen and toilet properly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute estimated that about 30 percent of the 110,000 subdivided flats in the city do not meet these minimum standards and require improvements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenny Tse, who chairs the institute’s Building Policy Panel, said that generally it would only cost owners tens of thousands dollars to improve their flats, adding that almost all upgrades could be carried out without affecting the building's common area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “All the proposed enhancements should be carried out within the subdivided units, not related to the common areas. For example, the fire service installation, we only need to buy a fire extinguisher, smoke detector or something like that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the drainage part, this is the only one they need to connect to the common drainage pipe, but I think that this is feasible and also easy to carry out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute also proposed a registration system for subdivided flats, saying owners must entrust professionals to inspect and accredit the units. Such inspection has to be conducted every three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said owners of sub-standard units should be given 12 months to make improvements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have to take care of the over 100,000 subdivided units in existing markets and we think that we cannot treat the 100,000 subdivided units at one time,” said Nathan Lee, who heads the institute’s Building Surveying Division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we should allow some time for the owners to take care of the existing tenants and also provide some relocation for the existing tenants. So we propose 12 months for the modification period.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute added these were just temporary solutions and the ultimate solution to the subdivided unit issue remained increasing public housing supply.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said they were concerned about growing congestion around the Western Harbour Crossing, after changes to tolls made it the busiest of the three harbour tunnels.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures show that since a shake-up of tolls in December, traffic flow at the Western Harbour Crossing has increased by 18 percent to around 103,000 vehicles a day, with queues at peak times getting longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Deputy Commissioner for Transport Leung Sai-ho said officials are planning to construct an additional lane at the exit of the tunnel on the Hong Kong Island side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, there's a bottleneck area... I'm sure the project will have a positive impact on the traffic queue and the vehicle speed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we can increase the capacity of the road section, we believe this can improve the overall performance of the Western Harbour Crossing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work on the extra lane is expected to begin in the second half of 2025 and to be completed by 2027.

    HK court delays Country Garden hearing till June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition seeking liquidation of Country Garden. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753541_1_20240517125904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin attend a tea ceremony in Beijing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was on Friday wrapping up his two-day state visit to China with a trip to the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties with Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He will join trade and investment talks there a day after a meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who told him that China-Russia relations should be "cherished and cared for" by both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two also discussed the conflict in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And hours after Xi and Putin met, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that China could not "have its cake and eat it too" with regard to the West and Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It can't have it both ways and want to have [better] relationships with Europe and other countries while simultaneously continuing to fuel the biggest threat to European security in a long time," Patel said, referring to the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Alan Lung, a political analyst and Co-convenor (International) of the Path of Democracy think tank, said he believes that China is looking to play a mediating role in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are only two countries in the world that doesn't need another country and that is the US and Russia because of its vast territory, but China cannot do that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has bigger stakes and has to cooperate with the West, and this is why China, I think Xi Jinping, desperately wants to, if possible, broker peace in Ukraine on behalf of Russia, on behalf of the Europeans."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same programme, Brian Yeung, who wrote a book on his time working in Russia, said he thinks China would not want the situation in Ukraine to undermine its ties with Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China might be the only, or at least the most important strategic partner to Russia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Recently, Xi Jinping also visited Europe and had a very fruitful conversation with the French president. That also signals that China doesn't really want to mess up with Europe for the sake of the China-Russia relationship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xin Zhang, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, said there are mixed opinions over the ongoing conflict, with some supporting Russia's narrative that the military operation is justified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also those who are very much on the pro-Ukraine side, looking at this as essentially a big power exploiting a small neighbouring power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation is complicated. There was a long, complicated historical cause for this conflict to escalate to such a degree. I try to emphasise that China is not the direct party in the conflict, and we would love to see a peaceful resolution through political negotiation."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials on Thursday said at least four people were killed in Texas as heavy storms with winds up to 160 kilometres per hour lashed the US state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Streets in downtown Houston were covered in glass from blown-out windows, video and photos posted to social media showed, as the National Weather Service warned of "severe" thunderstorms and possible tornadoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Downed trees and power lines littered residential areas, and around a million customers in the state had lost power -- including more than 800,000 in Harris County, where Houston is located.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mayor of Houston, John Whitmire, urged residents to avoid downtown, adding that public schools would be closed on Friday and asked non-essential workers to stay home as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mayor and the city's office of emergency management (OEM) were working with first responders to assess the damage, the city said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents were asked to stay off the roads and avoid unnecessary travel, according to the OEM. (AFP)

 Donald Trump's lawyers accused the star prosecution witness in his hush money trial of lying to jurors, portraying Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen on Thursday as a fabulist who was bent on seeing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee behind bars.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Defence attorney Todd Blanche pressed Cohen for hours with questions that focused as much on his misdeeds as on the case's specific allegations and tried to sow doubt in jurors’ minds about Cohen’s crucial testimony implicating the former US president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the past couple of days, Trump's defence team has attempted to portray Cohen — a onetime Trump loyalist who has become one of his biggest foes — as a media-obsessed opportunist who turned on the former president after he was denied a White House job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether the defence is successful in undermining Cohen's testimony could determine Trump's fate in the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the course of the trial's fourth week of testimony, Cohen described for jurors meetings and conversations he said he had with Trump about the alleged scheme to stifle stories about sex that threatened to torpedo Trump's 2016 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, who insists the prosecution is an effort to damage his campaign to reclaim the White House, says the payments to Cohen were properly categorised as legal expenses because Cohen was a lawyer.

  Trump's legal defence has suggested the former president was trying to protect his family, not his campaign, by squelching what he says were false, scurrilous claims. (AP)
