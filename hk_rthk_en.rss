<div class="itemFullText">
 The Macau government said its chief executive election will be held on October 13.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, voting was held for Election Committee members, with more than 5,500 people choosing 344 out of 348 candidates. Turnout was 88.12 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau lawmakers and deputies to the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are among the other 56 Election Committee members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They form a 400-member Election Committee that will be responsible for nominating and electing the new-term chief executive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incumbent Ho Iat-seng has not indicated yet if he will seek re-election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the law, the Macau chief executive must be a Chinese citizen who is a permanent resident of the SAR, at least 40 years old, has ordinarily resided in Macau for a continuous period of 20 years, supports the Basic Law, and is loyal to the People's Republic of China and the Macau SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday urged all sides in the Ukraine war to de-escalate as Kyiv's forces pierced deep into Russia's Kursk border region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault seemed to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army on Sunday appearing to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the offensive, Beijing on Monday urged all parties to follow "three principles for de-escalating the situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those are "no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fuelling the flame by any party", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China will continue to maintain communication with the international community and play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the crisis," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing released a paper last year calling for a political settlement to the conflict. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday urged Hongkongers in Japan to be careful after the country's authorities warned a "megaquake" was possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japanese officials issued their first ever megaquake advisory last Thursday after a 7.1-magnitude quake hit the south of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR administration said Hongkongers in Japan should exercise caution, attend to their personal safety and pay attention to announcements on the latest situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation. It urged any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or the Chinese Embassy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested a 27-year-old man after finding more than 200 kilogrammes of cocaine in a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the haul has a street value of HK$175 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrest was made in Lok Ma Chau on Saturday and officers said the suspect is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said the flat where the drugs were found had recently been rented out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would like to make an appeal here, especially to large property owners. If they notice potential tenants who seem extremely eager to rent these units or even request renting immediately after a quick look around, they should be extra cautious and pay attention to their backgrounds," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Monday said six people have died and 10 others were injured after a lightning strike caused a park pavilion to collapse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People were seeking shelter from the rain under the pavilion in the city of Changzhou in Jiangsu province on Sunday night when lightning struck the structure, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Search and rescue efforts went late into the night, with all 16 people rushed to the hospital, but six of them who suffered severe injuries later died despite extensive rescue efforts. The rest of them are in stable condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported that authorities there will conduct a comprehensive review of public facilities to ensure safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains across the east and south, and much of the north sweltering in successive heat waves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, heavy rain in Shaanxi province caused a highway bridge to collapse, killing at least 38 people. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    DAB calls for register of subdivided units

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday urged the government to set up a system to register subdivided flats in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as the government is preparing a report on ways to address substandard accommodation, including setting minimum standards for subdivided units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB members visited more than 20 subdivided flats as part of a study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party is proposing that subdivided flats should have a minimum area of seven square metres and a minimum height of 1.8 metres and must comply with building and fire safety regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said that for safety reasons, the kitchen and bathroom in these flats should be separate, adding that the government should prioritise eliminating unsafe subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen quite a lot of fire accidents, some of the poor subdivided units don't have windows and fire protection... this makes it quite dangerous for the people who live inside," said lawmaker Vincent Cheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also says residents of units deemed to be unacceptable should be provided with rehousing options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [residents] live in a very poor subdivided unit, they can choose to move into transitional housing," said Cheng.

    Pest that strips trees bare now on HK Island: expert

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pest which ravages the leaves of trees like the Chinese banyan leaving them bare is increasing being found on Hong Kong Island after spreading from other parts of the territory in the hot weather, an expert warned on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Larvae of the Phauda flammans moth feed on the leaves of ficus trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The insect was a rare sight in the SAR until around 2019 when it appeared in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, according to Ken So, chief executive of The Conservancy Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the number of trees on Hong Kong Island affected by the pest is increasing, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For insects, because the life cycle can be shortened or the reproduction of insects can always be affected by weather conditions, particularly talking about the temperature. Higher temperatures would favour the reproduction or growth of insects. So likely, the problem of Phauda flammans is highly related to hotter weather," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said pesticides can be used to control the insect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the larvae eat the leaves with pesticides, then it will kill the larvae, so that it stops or terminates the life cycle of the insects," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So added that professionals are also developing a trap specifically for Phauda flammans.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765839_1_20240812115111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has unanimously dismissed a final attempt by Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers to overturn their convictions for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai, Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the procession on August 18, which followed an approved anti-police demonstration led by the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a lower court earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, it upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final appeal had centred on the issue of "operational proportionality", a principle set out by two decisions of Britain's Supreme Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appellants argued that the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, and that a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But judges at the Court of Final Appeal on Monday rejected the argument that the arrest, prosecution, conviction and sentence must be separately justified as proportionate, saying a separate proportionality inquiry was "inappropriate and uncalled for".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defendants' convictions and consequent sentences do not stand alone. They are the result of the judge applying the law to the evidence and being satisfied individually of their guilt," the ruling said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The same pertains to the defendants' proposition in respect of arrest and prosecution. Those actions similarly do not occur in isolation. They represent steps taken to enforce particular offence-creating laws."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the presiding judges, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung and Roberto Ribeiro, said the two British legal precedents cited by the appellants "should not be followed in Hong Kong" because of differences between the two jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, statutory and other provisions which are found to be unconstitutional may be struck down as invalid whereas in the UK, a provision that is declared to be incompatible continues to be enforced as a valid law, with potentially different issues regarding proportionality arising thereafter," the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow justice Johnson Lam added that there is no basis in the SAR to consider the prosecution, conviction and sentence as "distinct, standalone restrictions" from the rule creating the offence relating to freedom of assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord David Neuberger of Abbotsbury, a non-permanent judge from Britain, said the constitutional differences in Hong Kong and the UK "do not mandate a different approach when it comes to considering whether a restriction on the freedom of assembly is proportionate", but they "do require a different approach if the court concludes that the restriction is not proportionate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who attended the hearing, said it was not appropriate to comment on the ruling.

  "We haven't had a chance to look at this very important judgement. This is not the right time to make comments. We just want to take this occasion to thank our legal teams and all the people who have been supporting us all the time," she said outside the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, left the court saying he had "no comment".

 The Space Museum says the Perseid meteor shower will peak before dawn on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual meteor shower has been active since last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Chiu from the museum said around 100 meteors per hour are expected between 11:30pm on Monday and 5am on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said Clear Water Bay will be one of the best locations for seeing them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the weather is suitable for watching, we would suggest people go to the extremely dark and also the wide sky area to watch the meteor shower. And the suggested area that's actually in the kite-flying area, Tai Mei Tuk and Clear Water Bay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu also said the museum will livestream the meteor shower on its YouTube channel, while offering insights into the astronomical aspects of the shooting stars.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Just opposite the fencing stadium, the Grand Palais on the Avenue des Champs Élysées, scores of tourists have been queuing up outside the largest Olympic merchandise store to take home a taste of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paris 2024 megastore offers a variety of souvenirs, from 5 euro pens and bracelets, to giant mascots costing 800 euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekday visitors have had to wait around 15 minutes to get inside the store, but most RTHK spoke to said it was worth queuing up for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adam, a UK tourist in Paris with his kids, bought a T-shirt, a hat, a poster and some badges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We spent about 110 euros, which I think, as it's only every four years, it's something to remember the Games by, so I think it's okay every once in a while,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic mascot “Phryge”, a little red hat symbolising French liberty, is one of the bestsellers at the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas from Hong Kong bought one because he wanted something special to take home with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s unique and it's like representing the culture and France and also it represents the spirit of the Olympics, so we're trying to look for something very unique for a gift,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to the French capital can also take home the smell of a fresh baguette, with the launch of scratch-and-sniff stamps by the French postal service La Poste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's to celebrate the baguette, which is one of the symbols of France for the tourists for them to enjoy and to share this with the people they live with abroad,” said Gaspard, a worker at the Olympic Village’s post office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French baguette was given Unesco heritage status in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell on Sunday became the first LIV Golf player to be suspended under its anti-doping policy for using an over-the-counter decongestant that contained a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2010 US Open champion used a decongestant at LIV's June event in Nashville that contained the banned substance levo-methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDowell posted on social media that he was struggling with severe congestion that affected his sleep prior to the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi-funded league said McDowell would be suspended for one tournament and fined US$125,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will be replaced in the field at the LIV Golf Greenbrier next week by an alternate. (AFP/AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes was helped off the field after suffering an injury while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred domestic cricket competition on Sunday, raising concerns he could miss the upcoming test series against Sri Lanka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Stokes pulled up while running between the wickets as the Superchargers chased a victory target of 153 against Manchester Originals at Old Trafford. Stokes appeared to clutch his left hamstring as he was completing a quick single from the non-striker’s end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes, who had bowled 15 overs in the match, retired hurt on two runs with England teammate Harry Brook coming out to replace him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes led England to a 3-0 series sweep against West Indies last month. England opens its test series against Sri Lanka next Wednesday at Old Trafford, with the third and final test at the Oval from September 6. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris said a triumphant "au revoir" to the Olympics on Sunday as the curtain came down on its widely praised staging of the global sporting spectacular.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A star-studded closing ceremony took place in front of around 71,500 spectators at the Stade de France to crown an event that has been broadly acclaimed as one of the greatest editions of the Olympics ever held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 270 artists performed in the packed arena for an estimated 9,000 athletes who marched into the venue as the festivities got into full swing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening segment of the ceremony festivities began with France's swimming hero Leon Marchand -- winner of four gold medals at these Games -- gathering the Olympic flame from the cauldron in the centre of Paris to begin its journey to the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rugby hero Antoine Dupont -- who led the host nation to a rugby sevens gold medal in one of the early highlights of the Games -- carried a tricolore flag into the Stade de France as partying athletes swarmed the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show included a theatrical sequence entitled "Records", which was a dream-like immersive journey through time, led by a "Golden Voyager".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musicians Phoenix then entertained the crowd with a series of hits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach hailed the Paris Games as "sensational".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish - or dare I say, Seine-sational Games," Bach said in a speech at the closing ceremony, in a reference to the river which staged the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the Los Angeles Olympics, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed to the Californian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then it was time for Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise to jump from the roof of the Stade de France into the closing ceremony before speeding off with the Olympic flag in a dramatic handover that began the anticipation for the Games in 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A beaming Cruise high-fived athletes after making the roughly 160-foot descent before jumping on a motorcycle and exiting the stadium as the crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Living up to the stunning success of the Paris Games may seem like mission impossible for LA and the celebrity-rich city will lean on its stars such as leading man Cruise as the Olympic spotlight turns to Southern California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise was among the many celebrities seen taking in the action at the Paris Games, showing up at gymnastics, swimming and soccer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, Yseult, a French R&B singer, performed "Comme d’habitude," the song famously adapted into "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lights dimmed as she serenaded the stadium before fireworks lit up the sky to conclude Paris 2024. (Agencies)

 A dazzling festival of sport in Paris officially ended on Day 16 as the 2024 Olympics concluded with a spectacular closing ceremony. The baton has been passed to Los Angeles, which hosts the Games in 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US edged out France in the last event of the day in women's basketball to claim their 40th gold medal in Paris. China also won a 40th gold in women's weightlifting, but the Americans end the Games ahead of the national team due to the fact they won 44 silvers compared with China's 27. Japan finished third while hosts France were fifth. Still, China's 40 golds is its second highest ever after the Beijing Olympics of 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong China's Ceci Lee was bidding for a medal in the women's omnium, but it wasn't to be. The SAR finished 37th in the table with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here are some of the highlights on the last day of the Olympic Games in Paris.

      Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands won the women's marathon, taking gold and achieving an astonishing triple by medalling in all three distance running events at the Games.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Hassan prevailed in the Olympic marathon in a thrilling sprint finish.

      She traded elbows with Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia with 150 metres left, then passed her along the railing to win the race in an Olympic record time of 2 hours, 22 minutes, 55 seconds.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      She also won bronze in the 5,000m and 10,000m.

       The United States held off France 67-66 to win an unprecedented eighth successive women's Olympic basketball gold on Sunday and extend their run of victories at the tournament to 61 games.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A'ja Wilson scored a game-high 21 points for the Americans who won the title for the 10th time overall, surviving a buzzer-beating shot from France's Gabby Williams.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The hosts needed a three to force overtime but Williams' foot was on three-point line as she let go off the ball, so her shot counted for just two points in a dramatic finale.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nineteen people including five children are confirmed dead after a landslide at a huge garbage dump in the Ugandan capital Kampala, a senior official said on Sunday, amid claims the site was a disaster waiting to happen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local media said homes, people and livestock were buried in mountains of waste at the landfill in the northern Kampala district of Kiteezi on Saturday after a collapse caused by heavy downpours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Yoweri Museveni said he had directed the army's special forces to help in the search and rescue operation and demanded to know who allowed people to live near such a "potentially hazardous and dangerous heap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area's resident commissioner Yasin Ndide said after visiting the scene of the disaster that the death toll was now 19, including five children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rescue mission is ongoing but with little hope of finding more survivors," he said, adding that local authorities were setting up temporary shelters for those affected by the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndide blamed the "encroachment" of local people who had breached the perimeter fence and settled on the site for the loss of life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala's metropolitan police spokesman Patrick Onyango had earlier told reporters at the scene that 14 bodies had been recovered on Saturday, and another four on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Onyango also said that 14 people had been rescued, while an estimated 1,000 were displaced and that the police were working with other government agencies and community leaders to see how to help those affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala mayor Erias Lukwago said that "many, many more could be still buried in the heap as the rescue operation is ongoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described it as a "national disaster," blaming corrupt officials who he said had been syphoning off money that should have been used to maintain the landfill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Museveni said in a statement posted on X that he had ordered payments to the victims' families of five million Ugandan shillings (US$1,300) for each fatality and one million shillings (US$270) for each injured person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for an investigation into how people were allowed to live so close to the site and ordered the removal of all those living in the "danger zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excavators were still churning through huge mounds of rubbish on Sunday as crowds of local residents looked on, some wailing in despair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukwago had on Saturday raised concerns about the safety of the 36-acre (14-hectare) landfill which was established in 1996 and takes in almost all garbage collected across Kampala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a disaster and was bound to happen as the landfill was full to capacity," he said, adding that it received about 1,500 tonnes of waste a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, Lukwago had warned that people working and living near the site were at risk of numerous health hazards due to overflowing waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several areas in Uganda and other parts of East Africa have been battered by heavy rains recently, including Ethiopia, the second most populous country on the continent. (AFP)

    Hamas tells Gaza mediators to go with Biden truce plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People inspect the damage in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood after it was destroyed by Israeli bombs on Sunday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765795_1_20240812034601.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday called on US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to implement a ceasefire plan for Gaza put forward by US President Joe Biden, instead of holding "more negotiations."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas "demands that the mediators present a plan to implement what they proposed to the movement... based on Biden's vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and compel the occupation (Israel) to comply, rather than going through more negotiation rounds or new proposals," the Palestinian group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators have invited both Israel and Hamas for a round of negotiations on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, shortly after the killing of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Israel agreed to a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks to facilitate the release of hostages still held in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the killing of Haniyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several rounds of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed until now, except for a one-week truce that was observed at the end of November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That truce saw the release of scores of hostages in exchange of dozens of Palestinians prisoners who were held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 31, Biden unveiled what he said was a three-stage plan for a ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plan includes a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, with Israeli forces withdrawing from "all populated areas of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "a number" of hostages captured in the October 7 attacks, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The remains of some hostages who had been killed would also be returned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their "homes and neighbourhoods" throughout Gaza, including in the north, which has been devastated by months of Israeli bombing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the initial six-week period, Israel and Hamas would "negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceasefire would also be extended if the negotiations continue, with mediators working to ensure they continue, Biden said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In phase two, also lasting around another six weeks, Israeli forces would completely withdraw from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "all remaining living hostages" including male Israeli soldiers. This has been a key sticking point for Hamas in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If both sides keep to the deal it will lead to the "cessation of hostilities permanently," Biden said, quoting what he said had been an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third and final stage, a major reconstruction and stabilisation plan for Gaza would begin, backed by the US and the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 Hamas attacks resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,790 people, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    Russia concedes Ukraine advances in Kursk offensive

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Ukrainian missile was blamed for this fire at a residential building in Kursk. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765791_1_20240812023140.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday acknowledged Ukrainian forces had pierced deep into the Kursk border region in an offensive that a top official in Ukraine said was aimed to "destabilise" Russia and "stretch" its armed forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border," the security official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock assault, now in its sixth day, appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army rushing in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash the incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But its army on Sunday appeared to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a daily briefing on the situation in the western Kursk region, the defence ministry said it had "foiled attempts" by Ukraine's forces to "break through deep into Russian territory" using armoured vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said some of those forces were located near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian official also said Russia's claims that Kyiv had deployed 1,000 troops were a serious underestimation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a lot more... Thousands," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After days of official silence, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the offensive for the first time in his nightly address on Saturday, saying that Kyiv was "pushing the war into the aggressor's territory."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022 and has waged an unrelenting campaign, occupying swathes of the east and south and subjecting Ukrainian cities to daily missile and drone attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After re-capturing large areas in 2022, Kyiv has largely been on the back foot, increasingly struggling with manpower and arms supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault on Russia's western Kursk region has been the largest and most successful cross-border offensive by Kyiv so far – and the most significant attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has used air power, artillery fire and drones in a bid to quash the advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said on Saturday that more than 76,000 civilians had been evacuated from border areas, with more leaving on Sunday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu will be awarded the Olympic floor exercise bronze medal, after it was taken away from her following an appeal from the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Olympic Committee made the announcement on Sunday, one day after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the request by the American team to re-evaluate Jordan Chiles' score was lodged four seconds after the one-minute deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review, which went ahead at the time, upgraded Chiles to bronze from fifth, behind Brazil's winner Rebeca Andrade and fellow US gymnast Simone Biles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was a devastating blow for Barbosu, who thought she had bagged bronze and was already celebrating with the Romanian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can barely express my emotions, I can't believe it," Barbosu said after learning she was awarded her country's only gymnastics medal in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A devastated Chiles took to Instagram, posting four broken hearts, adding: "I am taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who trains with Chiles, and won team gold with her in Paris, added: "Sending you so much love Jordan. Keep your chin up Olympic champ! We love you!" (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Two migrants die trying to cross Channel to Britain

    <![CDATA[<img alt="So far this year 25 migrants have died trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765786_1_20240812001833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead," the maritime authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death toll this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket," on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to a tally of British government figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says every athlete's efforts have made all Hongkongers proud.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday congratulated the SAR's athletes for their achievements at the Paris Olympics, noting it was the first time that Team Hong Kong, China had won more than one gold medal at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Golds from foil fencer Edgar Cheung and épée fencer Vivian Kong, as well as two swimming bronzes from Siobhan Haughey, put the SAR 37th in the medals table, which is the city's highest ever ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Hong Kong athlete has given their utmost and unleashed their full potential in the Olympic arena. In spite of the results, all athletes have fully exhibited their determination, perseverance and will, demonstrating their professional attitude and sportsmanship," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of Hong Kong and I are deeply inspired and moved. The people of Hong Kong are proud of the high level of performance shown by Hong Kong athletes, and each and every one of them is a hero in our hearts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the government would provide more sporting facilities, such as converting an existing sports centre into a dedicated fencing venue, and speeding up a study on building a fencing arena and a swimming pool which can host international competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the current financial year, the administration had provided more than HK$940 million in funding to the Sports Institute through the Elite Athletes Development Fund, around a 40 percent increase from five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said with the Paris Paralympic Games later this month and Hong Kong co-hosting the National Games next year, he's confident that society would continue to support the SAR's athletes to shine and "demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Hong Kong".

<div class="itemFullText">
 For the second consecutive day, the United States silenced the home crowd in Paris as their women's basketball team narrowly edged their French counterparts, 67-66, in a gripping gold medal match to notch an eighth straight Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both teams struggled to find the basket in an unusually low-scoring first half, which ended 25-all. France shot 28 percent from the field, compared to 29 percent for Team USA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts then brought the crowd on their feet, after starting the second half on a 10-0 run to go 35-25 up for their biggest lead of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that advantage did not last, as the Americans finally broke out of a funk and scored 16 of the next 21 points to go back on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides exchanged leads in the fourth quarter, but the Americans held on to their slim edge to win by the finest of margins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Down by three with 3.8 seconds left, France could have sent the game into overtime with a three. But Gabby Williams stepped inside the three-point line as she hoisted - and made - a two-point shot as time expired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia earlier beat Belgium 85-81 in the bronze medal match, returning to the podium for the first time since London 2012.

    In TV interview, Biden brands Trump a 'danger' to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden made the claim in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765781_1_20240811234132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since dropping out of the White House race, warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mark my words, if he wins... this election, watch what happens," Biden told CBS News in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's a genuine danger to American security. Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since withdrawing after his flailing debate performance against Trump underlined fears about his age and mental abilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week, he appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining his exit, he said other Democratic Party politicians standing for re-election feared he would damage their chances – and added that his only priority was to stop Trump from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A critical issue for me still is – not a joke – maintaining this democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is – we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery – and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's age had come to dominate the 2024 campaign, and the Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since his exit, as Harris has enjoyed a surge in support that has left Trump struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to stay on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth, but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's light campaign schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, JD Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about white supremacist attacks on his family, child care, asylum seekers and abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK on Sunday co-hosted a show with the public broadcaster in Indonesia at the Victoria Park, where the audience was treated to performances from local and Indonesian singers and dancers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indonesian singer Nabilla Gomes flew in to perform live at "RTHK Summer POP UP", and she was joined on stage by Hong Kong singer Lagchun, Indonesian-Hong Kong singer-songwriters and dance groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event aimed to foster bond among people from the two places, which is among cooperation priorities of China's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In February, RTHK signed a memorandum of understanding with the Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) to strengthen cooperation, jointly producing a radio programme, "Halo Jakarta! Hello Hong Kong!", in Bahasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme was broadcast on both stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Director of Broadcasting, Eddie Cheung, noted that Sunday's event was a celebration of Indonesia’s Independence Day, as it allowed the programme to go outdoors for greater interaction with the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The event shows that Hong Kong is an open and inclusive society," he said while giving a speech at the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through joint programmes and events, the two broadcasters show how to put people-to-people bond under the Belt and Road Initiative into practice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, the Indonesian Consul-General, Yul Edison, said the media have a growing importance in today's world in connecting people, combating stereotypes and addressing misinformation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jennifer Valente of the United States on Sunday retained her Olympic title in the women’s omnium at the Paris Games while the SAR's Ceci Lee finished 20th.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That concluded Hong Kong, China's participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente ended with 144 points in the multi-race event, consisting of the scratch, tempo, elimination and points races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland’s Daria Pikulik took silver while Ally Wollaston of New Zealand rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first scratch race, cyclists were ranked and awarded points by the order they finished the 30-lap event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente was off to a strong start and finished first, earning the maximum 40 points, with Canada’s Maggie Coles-Lyster and Georgia Baker of Australia coming from behind to grab second and third respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, making her Olympic debut, came 19th among the 22 riders to earn four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist moved up to 18th overall after the second tempo race, where the top contestant per lap was awarded a point from the fifth lap forward while 20 points were given for lapping an opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland’s Lara Gillespie came out on top in this race but Valente maintained her overall lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old SAR athlete earned 16 points by finishing 13th, giving her 20 points at the end of the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the elimination round, the last cyclist of every other lap was knocked out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente won this round as well to continue to top the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, was the fifth athlete eliminated and ended up with six points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final points race, points were awarded to the top four athletes for every 10 laps in the gruelling 80-lap race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist finished near the bottom of the pack in the race that was won by Poland’s Pikulik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, a tearful Lee described her performance as "very poor", saying she felt she let many people down, including her coaches, teammates and the former top SAR cyclist Sarah Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like in the past, I did very poorly in the scratch race, and I couldn't change that today," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though Sarah Lee very diligently tried to pass on her experience to me before the race, I still did very poorly. Coaches and teammates spent a lot of time training with me for the omnium, but I still raced very poorly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had said she hoped to finish in the top 10 overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee, who won silver at the Asian Games last year, added that her Paris experience allowed her to get a taste of just how good the world's finest cyclists are. She also said she hopes to work hard in future to improve her fitness and use of tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's cycling team head coach, Herve Dagorne, said while he could understand her frustrations, he felt she could have been more aggressive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the ominum, and the last event is the points race. You need to score points, so if you don't try, you don't get it, it will not come from the sky," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can understand it's disappointing... I wish she could have attacked more in the points race, like the Japanese did and the French did. They gained a lap, [scoring] 20 points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation earned a total of four medals in Paris: golds for fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung, and two bronzes from swimming star Siobhan Haughey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung will be the flagbearers for the SAR at the closing ceremony.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Weightlifter Li Wenwen on Sunday won China's 40th gold at the Paris Olympics, finishing first in the women’s +81kg category.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li lifted a combined 309kg at the South Paris Arena, 10kg more than South Korea’s Park Hye-jeong in second place and 21kg more than American Emily Campbell, who took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese weightlifter checked off with 136kg in the snatch, 5kg more than Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li then raised 173kg overhead with relative ease in the clean and jerk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having already won the race, she ditched the third lift and instead picked up her coach to celebrate on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, a two-time world champion, topped the podium in Tokyo three years ago in the women’s +87kg class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old holds the world and Olympic records for the women’s highest weightlifting category.

 Weightlifting champion Li Fabin and women's hockey team captain Ou Zixia will be the flagbearers for China in the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, 31, is a Tokyo Olympic champion who successfully defended his title in the men's 61kg weightlifting category at the Paris Games on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He performed consistently in the snatch, ultimately lifting 143kg to secure first place and set a new Olympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also holds the Olympic records for the clean and jerk and total weight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being chosen as a flagbearer is something I never even dared to imagine. I am incredibly excited and proud. This is a high recognition of the Chinese weightlifting team and the glory earned through the hard work of generations of weightlifters. I am extremely honoured to carry this responsibility," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ou led the women's hockey team to the Olympic final on Friday, where they lost to the Netherlands 3-1 in the penalty shootout.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they have arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they confiscated 34kg of suspected methamphetamine and 1kg of ketamine, with a total street value of HK$18.5 million, in a Cheung Sha Wan flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police discovered that this drug-trafficking syndicate was renting an upscale private residential flat as a warehouse and a distribution centre for drugs. They took advantage of the low foot traffic and heavy security in an attempt to evade law enforcement," inspector Chang Yuen-lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police urge property owners to check the backgrounds of potential tenants such as occupation, income verification and the intended use of the rented unit before renting them out, so as to prevent their properties from being misused by criminals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect is set to appear in court on Monday.

 Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands won Olympic women's marathon gold in Paris on Sunday in a thrilling sprint finish.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hassan traded elbows with Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia with 150 metres left, then passed her along the railing to win the race for her third distance medal of the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hassan finished in an Olympic record time of 2 hours, 22 minutes, 55 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also won bronze in the 5,000m and 10,000m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assefa finished 3 seconds behind Hassan to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya’s Hellen Obiri took the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopian-born Hassan lingered behind the leaders for the bulk of the race before summoning up the energy for a late-race kick that will go down as one of the best the sport has seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been impossible to call with all the favourites among a leading pack up until the last 10km.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three runners from China took part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang Deshun finished 59th in a time of 2:36.47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xia Yuyu was 72nd and Bai Li 76th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking from tradition, the women’s Olympic marathon was held on the final day instead of the men’s race. (Agencies)

    HKers putting rope skipping on the map in Paris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Olympic delegation isn’t the only team representing the SAR in Paris – the city’s rope skipping performance squad is also in the French capital to push for their sport to be included in future editions of the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rope skipping troupe is amping up the atmosphere at the Paris Games by performing at the Place de la Concorde, which has become the heart of urban sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time in history, various urban disciplines, such as 3x3 basketball, street and park skateboarding, BMX freestyle and breaking, have been grouped together at one site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though these sports have increasingly been adopted in the past two Games, there are those, like rope skipping, that still have not made their way to the Olympic stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's what the Hong Kong Rope Skipping Association, China, is hoping to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform at the open stage of Parc Urbain to promote urban culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tina Wong, the association's chairperson, said performing in Paris is an opportunity they could not pass up, even though the Games conflicted with the jump rope Asian Championships in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are here on the Olympic platform. We actually have the goal or you could say dream to have jump rope skipping to be included in the Olympics in 2032 in Australia because Australia is one the strongest countries in this sport. This is a more long-term goal. On a short-term basis, we are aiming for Asia,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually last year, the Olympic Council of Asia has already granted rope skipping the provisional membership, so meaning we are already included in Asia. This year, we are here. Next year, we are aiming to go to the Youth Asian Games and pave the way for the Asian Games and then the Olympics. We hope with more support, we can officially be on the Olympic stage soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four athletes from the SAR have made their way to Paris to perform, including 18-year-old Yuen Hiu-tung, who said that the atmosphere was unbelievable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s like a dream to come here because even though we paid to come here, it’s a very valuable experience for us because we don’t know when jump rope can get into [the] Olympics, so it is a good experience to promote jump rope, and also letting everyone know how is jump rope [works] and how everyone is enjoying this sport,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The honorary secretary general of Hong Kong's top sports body, Edgar Yang, on Sunday said the city should nurture all athletes with potential, rather than solely focusing on one or two elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to a TV programme, the senior member of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China said the SAR has huge potential for sports development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the system must be very sound, and this sound method starts from popularising and definitely not focusing on just one or two athletes - but rather on the overall system that can bring out potential. We must put in a great effort. Even for those who have not yet fully realised their potential, we must enable them to be inspired," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Paris Olympics nears its end, Yang said Hong Kong athletes are now world class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR athletes have secured two gold medals in fencing and two bronze medals in swimming.

    Australian government urged to ban gambling ads

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs. Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765725_1_20240811154222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of leading Australians has demanded the government impose a total ban on gambling ads in a country that racks up some of the biggest losses per person in the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gambling losses in Australia, with a population of just 27 million, are estimated at A$25 billion a year (US$16 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adverts enticing people to risk their cash are widespread on television, radio and billboards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs, too, drawing more to part with their money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Gambling advertising in Australia is out of control with one million gambling ads being aired on free-to-air television and radio in just one year," said a letter signed by more than 60 prominent Australians to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the letter released at the weekend included former political, union, sports and faith leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Albanese's Labor government and the conservative opposition to agree to outlaw all gambling advertising within three years, in line with the recommendations of a 2023 report into gambling harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many Australians are alarmed about the proliferation of gambling advertising on our screens and the mounting losses through gambling," said former prime minister John Howard, who was among the signatories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe gambling losses are responsible for enormous harm throughout the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Studies cited by the government put Australian gambling losses at A$25 billion a year, representing a global record per capita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even during a period of Covid-19 measures that closed many pubs, clubs and casinos in the 2020-2021 financial year, Australian state government statistics showed gambling losses exceeded A$24 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total ban on all gambling advertising is essential to stop gambling companies targeting our children," said Alliance for Gambling Reform chief executive Martin Thomas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any decision to simply cap advertising, or limit a blanket ban to only social media, would be a win for vested interests and leave Australians exposed to significant harm," Thomas said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the financial losses, the cost of inaction would be "mounting financial ruin, mental health problems, suicide, and the family violence that gambling can exacerbate", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Nine Entertainment newspapers have said the government is expected to announce proposed legislation within weeks, possibly opting for limits instead of a total advertising ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said last week his government had engaged with "stakeholders" and was committed to "minimising gambling harm" but declined to say whether an advertising ban was envisaged. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that Hong Kong should integrate further with China's national development and contribute to modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan said that the Third Plenary Session held in Beijing last month passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform and Promoting Chinese-style Modernization," which outlines Hong Kong's strategic positioning in leveraging the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, enhances the city's status as an international hub, and supports Hong Kong's bid in gathering top international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an international financial centre, Chan said that Hong Kong should fulfil its role as an offshore RMB business hub, focusing on shipping centre development, smart shipping, and green shipping, to make Hong Kong a "cross-border supply chain management centre" that provides one-stop support for mainland enterprises in expanding their production capacity and supply chain layout overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said this will generate new trade service demands and attract greater opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the SAR government is also recruiting talent and has launched a series of initiatives like the Top Talent Pass Scheme that supports talent development, to attract more top international talent to the region.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong on Sunday kicked off her visit to Hangzhou with a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme - a mentorship scheme aimed at helping underprivileged Hong Kong teenagers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During the five-day trip, Kong, along with the delegation, will visit technology companies and athlete training centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of her departure, Kong said she wanted to give something back to Hong Kong, as she started her new job as an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as an athlete, I worked really hard to train and to make Hong Kong people proud, to win results and to unite everyone so that we can all enjoy sports. And now that I'm lucky enough to join the Jockey Club, I wish I could use my platform and use the power of sports to unite everyone and hopefully just make sure that we all love sports and be happier," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said dozens of underprivileged pupils were joining the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eighty-four pupils and five mentors will take part in the five-day tour. The itinerary is diverse, ranging from innovation and technology, history, culture, to sports. We expect that senior officials from the SAR will also join this tour," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong announced her retirement from full-time fencing last week, after she won the women's individual epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics.

 There were 39 events up for contention on Day 15 in Paris, the second last day of these Olympics, and China went on a gold rush, completing a clean sweep of all the golds on offer in diving, table tennis and artistic swimming. The national team also celebrated Olympic wins in weightlifting, rhythmic gymnastics and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That single day haul of six gold medals means China leads the table with 39 golds, ahead of the United States which has 38. Australia maintain third place in the table.

    Like the divers, the national table tennis squad also made history by completing a clean sweep of all golds on offer at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    China completed the feat after winning the women's team title, the sixth time the Chinese have collected the full set.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Chinese women withstood a brave Japanese challenge but eventually overpowered their opponents 3-0 to snatch gold, the fifth Olympic title out of five events.

After winning the team event, the Chinese twin sibling pair of Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi dazzled in the pool to win gold ahead of Britain who took silver and the Netherlands the bronze.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China clinched a third boxing gold at the Paris Olympics, as Li Qian was crowned women's middleweight champion after winning the bout against Panama's Atheyna Bylon on a 4-1 split decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, who took silver in Tokyo, was adjudged as the better performer in two of the three rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old top seed has now collected Olympic medals of all colours, having also won bronze in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said after the bout that by winning gold, she had made amends for the "regret" in Tokyo, and a fitting response to both herself and the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's boxers have won three golds and two silvers in Paris, with all of them coming in women's events.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The star-studded US men's basketball team successfully clinched their fifth straight Olympic gold -- beating France 98-87 in a hotly-contested final at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Curry hit eight three pointers to lead the Americans with 24 points. Four of his triples came in the final three minutes of the game to silence a raucous home crowd at Bercy Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of the Tokyo Olympics final three years ago, French center Victor Wembanyama finished with 26 points and seven rebounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts were able to keep the game close for much of the first three quarters, trailing 66-72 entering the final frame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Wembanyama tip-in cut the deficit to three with less than three minutes to go, but Curry then took control with his hot-shooting to put the US back up by nine with less than a minute remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After scoring his final basket, Curry, the four-time NBA champion, did his trademark “go to sleep” gesture where he puts his hands on the side of his face to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the 36-year-old sharp-shooter's first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Durant and Devin Booker scored 15 points apiece for the Americans, while LeBron James chipped in 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite a losing effort, French forward Guerschon Yabusele continued his strong play at the Games, finishing with 20 points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Running enthusiasts say they are thrilled to have a chance to follow the footsteps of their Olympic heroes in the heart of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For the first time, some 20,000 amateurs were able to run on the same route as marathon athletes on the penultimate day of the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The “Marathon For All” sets off at the French capital’s city hall and finishes at Esplanade des Invalides via Versaille, passing through landmarks such as the Louvre Museum and the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy came all the way from Hong Kong for a once in a lifetime experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because it's the Olympic Games. I think in a lifetime you cannot join. It shows that everyone can try to run on the same road, no matter if you are an elite runner or you are just a normal [person]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another participant, Michele from the United States, hoped she won't get too distracted by the city's night scenery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most difficult part is...I'm in Paris. This is my first time here. And I love it. And so I'm very distracted with everything else that's going on. So it's really hard for me to kind of just settle in, enjoy the moment, and just be here for the marathon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elizabeth, a hill runner from London, didn’t want to miss the opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just thought it was mad not to sign up. Honestly it's incredible. I was watching the men’s race, and I'm sort of joking that I'm going to come home an Olympian."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km route pays tribute to a key event of the French Revolution - the women’s march on Versailles in 1789.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's B-Boy Phil Wizard won the inaugural Olympic men's breakdancing gold in Paris on Saturday, beating home favourite Dany Dann of France in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, whose real name is Philip Kim, triumphed amid the opulent grandeur of the Place de la Concorde, with B-Boy Victor of the United States taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also known as breaking, the street dance is making its first and possibly last appearance at the Games, having been left off the programme for Los Angeles 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's competition saw 16 dancers - or B-Boys - going head-to-head in a series of battles, starting with a round robin before moving to a knock-out stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, a 27-year-old former world champion, had the crowd against him in the final against Dany Dann, a 36-year-old with blue hair whose real name is Danis Civil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Canadian soon had them eating out of his hand thanks to his incredible routine, for which the nine judges awarded him a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard explained the panel of judges were looking for "something new every round".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You may well think it's the most explosive, crazy dynamic movements that score the most points," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in breaking there's a lot of different categories and the most important thing is originality and diversity of movement."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Indian soldiers were killed in clashes in Kashmir, the military said early on Sunday, after security forces exchanged fire with militants in the disputed territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kashmir, particularly its southern Hindu-majority region Jammu, has seen a string of battles with insurgents in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army wrote on social media that two soldiers had "laid down their lives in the line of duty" in Anantnag district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army and police had clashed with militants after launching an operation in the area, according to a social media post by the local military unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinar Corps said on X that two civilians were also injured "due to indiscriminate, desperate and reckless firing by terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and each side claims it in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebel groups have waged an insurgency since 1989, demanding independence or merger with Pakistan, in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, soldiers and rebels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi and Islamabad accuse each other of stoking militancy and espionage to undermine each other, and the nuclear-armed rivals have fought multiple conflicts for control of the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, at least 11 Indian soldiers were killed in Kashmir following a spate of militant attacks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States' men's 4x400m team set a new Olympic record en route to winning gold medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rai Benjamin, who won the 400m hurdles gold, anchored the US quartet to victory, which also featured Christopher Bailey, Vernon Norwood and Bryce Deadmon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed the relay in 2 minutes and 54.43 seconds for an exciting finish at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Botswana, with 200m champion Letsile Tebogo on their fourth leg, took silver in an African record of 2 minutes, 54.53 seconds, while Britain claimed bronze in a European record of 2 minutes, 55.83 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 4x400m gold also went to the Americans, as Shamier Little, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Gabrielle Thomas and Alexis Homes won in three minutes, 15.27 seconds, just a tenth of a second short of the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands took silver in 3 minutes 19.50 seconds, and Britain edged Ireland for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on, American sprinter Masai Russell won the women's 100m hurdles gold in another stunning photo finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finished the race in 12.33 seconds, a hundredth of a second ahead of France's Cyrena Samba-Mayela, who got her country's first track medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion, Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico, got bronze in 12.36 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Emmanuel Wanyonyi ran the third-fastest time in history to win men's 800m, clocking a personal best one minute and 41.19 seconds, just barely ahead of Canada's world champion Marco Arop, who got silver. Algeria's Djamel Sedjati had the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's Hamish Kerr became the first athlete from his country to win a high jump medal, taking gold after winning a jump-off with American Shelby McEwen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both men had cleared 2.36m, and decided they didn't want to share the top spot on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze went to Mutaz Barshim from Qatar, a joint-gold medallist at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In women's javelin, Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi sealed the gold medal with her opening throw, a season best effort of 65.80m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Faith Kipyegon broke her own Olympic record to win gold in women's 1,500m, finishing the race in 3 minutes 51.29 seconds, more than two seconds faster than her previous mark. She also became the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic 1,500m golds with another superb display of middle distance running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen middle distance star won gold in men's 5,000m, finishing the race in 13 minutes and 13.66 seconds. (Agencies)

    China achieves artistic swimming double

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For the third time on Saturday, China secured a clean sweep of gold medals in a sport after Wang Qianyi and Wang Liuyi clinched the duet in artistic swimming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old twin siblings from Shenzhen performed last out of 17 nations at the Aquatics Centre, after finishing first in the technical routine on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came back only fourth in the free routine, but the combined score of 566.4783 points was still enough to be crowned champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain's Kate Shortman and Isabelle Thorpe won silver at nearly eight points adrift, while the Dutch twins of Bregje and Noortje de Brouwer rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result marked a perfect ending for China, who already struck gold in the team event on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national artistic swimming team were runners-up in both events in the past two Games, losing to Russia on all four occasions. But the defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the country's conflict with Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the Wang sisters will return to school next month, having already been admitted to the Education University of Hong Kong's Doctor of Education (Chinese prospective) programme.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jonny Evans gave City the chance to win it when he skied his spot kick. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765683_1_20240811024639.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City avenged their FA Cup final defeat to Manchester United to lift the Community Shield 7-6 on penalties on Saturday, after a 1-1 draw at Wembley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The game exploded into life in the final 10 minutes as Alejandro Garnacho gave United the lead before Bernardo Silva levelled in the 89th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's men then edged a marathon shoot-out as Jadon Sancho and Jonny Evans failed to score for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have won the Premier League for a record four consecutive seasons but it is the first time in that run that they have won the season opener after defeats to Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The English champions were severely hampered by the absence of a series of key players due to their late return to pre-season after competing at Euro 2024 and the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's England trio of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Phil Foden, as well as Spain midfielder Rodri are yet to return to training following their efforts in reaching the final of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, United boss Erik ten Hag showed his desperation to win more silverware by thrusting teenager Kobbie Mainoo straight back into the heart of the action after his starring role for England in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite also leaving Kevin De Bruyne and Silva on the bench, City controlled the game early on with the electric Jeremy Doku causing havoc down the left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James McAtee could be handed his chance to shine this season by Pep Guardiola with Julian Alvarez set to join Atletico Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And McAtee, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield United, was inches away from making his mark with a curling effort that came back off the post midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's job is widely believed to have been saved by beating City back in May and he will feel his side should have got the better of their rivals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United were being starved of possession but still managed to create the better of the chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo should have gone for goal himself rather than trying to square to Bruno Fernandes with the goal gaping as half-time approached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes started in an unfamiliar centre-forward role due to the absence of Rasmus Hojlund through injury and a lack of match fitness for Joshua Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United captain thought he had opened the scoring with a stunning strike on the hour mark that was ruled out for offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho was introduced for the final half-hour and brought more pace and invention to the United attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentine teed up Marcus Rashford, who could only hit the post with just Ederson to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho thought he had won the game on 82 minutes as he jinked inside the City defence and fired low into the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, City rallied and levelled in the final minute of the 90 when Oscar Bobb's cross was headed in by Silva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Portuguese midfielder was then the first to miss in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Andre Onana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, though, experienced more penalty woe at Wembley after missing in the final of Euro 2020 for England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Ederson, who then fired in himself to keep City alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evans gave City the chance to win it when he blazed over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it was a tale of redemption for Manuel Akanji, whose saved penalty cost Switzerland in their Euros quarter-final against England, as the centre-back stroked home the winner. (AFP)

    US inflation still 'uncomfortably' high: Fed official

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765680_1_20240811011554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation remains "uncomfortably" above the Federal Reserve's target despite the progress it has made in recent months, a senior bank official said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank has held interest rates at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent following a pandemic-era surge in prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed's favoured inflation gauge now sits at an annual rate of just 2.5 percent – well below the peak reached in 2022 – while the US economy is still growing and the labour market has weakened somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, Fed chair Jerome Powell suggested in late July that the bank could move ahead with its first interest rate cut as soon as September – if economic data continues to come in as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some Fed officials have been more cautious about signalling rate cuts than others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The progress in lowering inflation during May and June is a welcome development," Fed governor Michelle Bowman told a conference in Colorado Springs, according to prepared remarks. "But inflation is still uncomfortably above the committee's two percent goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite "upside risks," Bowman said she still expects inflation to ease in the coming months, but warned policymakers to remain patient "and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to a single data point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The remarks from Bowman, who is a permanent voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, suggest she remains concerned about cutting interest rates too soon – despite overwhelming support for a September rate cut in the financial markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures traders are now wholly convinced that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September, and are instead split over how big its first cut will be, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US women's football team won its fifth Olympic gold medal by beating Brazil 1-0 on Mallory Swanson’s early second-half goal in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Americans, who hadn't won gold since the 2012 London Olympics, closed out an undefeated run to the title in their first international campaign under new coach Emma Hayes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher preserved the win with a one-handed save on Adriana’s header in stoppage time at Parc des Princes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss is more heartbreak for Brazil and its iconic star, Marta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six-time world player of the year has never won a Women’s World Cup or an Olympics. This is expected to be her last major international tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the third victory for the United States over Brazil in an Olympic final. The Americans also beat the Brazilians in the 2004 in Athens and four years later in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil has never finished better than runner up at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three years ago in Tokyo, the US settled for the bronze medal. (AP)

    New polls give Harris a lead over Trump in key states

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Voters polled in Pennsylvania said they saw Kamala Harris as more intelligent than Donald Trump and having a better temperament to govern. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765677_1_20240811002507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new polls published on Saturday, apparently eroding the advantage the former president has enjoyed there over the past year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Harris leading Trump by an identical 50 percent to 46 percent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the US electoral college voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The polls are a reversal of surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed Harris instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. The polling showed voters still prefer Trump on the key issues of the economy and immigration, though Harris had a 24-point advantage when voters were asked whom they trust on the issue of abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris's candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her announcement on Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energised Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans' successful national convention last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favourability – up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, his running mate JD Vance and other Republicans have tried an array of attacks meant to weaken Harris – with Trump even questioning her racial identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the new polls show Democrats strongly supporting the younger and more vigorous Harris who, with Walz, has been campaigning at a furious pace this week in swing states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among Democrats, voter satisfaction with their choice of candidates has shot up by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May, the polls found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three months ago, it was Republicans who expressed a higher level of satisfaction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surveys were conducted between August 5 and 9, with at least 600 voters in each state. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's team completed the country's clean-sweep of table tennis gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after defeating Japan 3-0 in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha, Chen Meng and Wang Manyu outclassed a fighting Japanese team of Hina Hayata, Miwa Harimoto and Miu Hirano for China's fifth gold in the sport, after the nation had earlier won both the men's and women's singles, the men's team as well as mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first match of the women's team final, Chen and Wang teamed up in the doubles against Hayata and Harimoto. The Chinese pair came back from two one-game deficits to force a deciding fifth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan raced to a 9-5 lead in the pivotal game, before Chen and Wang went on a 7-1 spurt to win 12-10 and take the first match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hirano then took on Sun in the second match, as she raced to a 7-1 start to open the matchup. However, the world number one Chinese player came roaring back to win the first game 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun then took the next two games, 11-6, 11-6, for a 2-0 lead overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall, Japan's Harimoto put up a fight in the third match by taking the first game against Wang, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese player stormed back to win the next three games, 12-10, 11-7, 11-6 to bring home the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the game, all three Chinese players said Japan proved to be difficult opponents, noting the Japanese were able to lead twice in the opening doubles match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said for her, it was important to come from behind and take the first singles game, adding it was a total team effort for the country to take home all Olympic table tennis golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy for us to take home all five gold medals. I very much thank our motherland, our team, there are many supportive forces behind us," she told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually today, it wasn't just the three of us competing, the whole Chinese table tennis team were behind us, giving us support."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the introduction of the women's team category in 2008, China has won all five of the event's gold medals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the UK on Saturday to protest recent rioting blamed on the far-right in the wake of the Southport knife attack that killed three children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Crowds massed in London, Glasgow, Belfast, Manchester and numerous other English towns and cities, as fears of violent confrontations with anti-immigration agitators failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It followed a similar situation unfolding on Wednesday night, when anticipated far-right rallies up and down the country were instead replaced by gatherings organised by the Stand Up To Racism advocacy group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen places across England as well as Belfast had been hit by unrest prior to that, following the July 29 stabbing spree, which was wrongly linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration, as well as police, vehicles and other sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, recent nights have been largely peaceful in English towns and cities, prompting hope among authorities that the more than 700 arrests and numerous people already being jailed has deterred further violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in Northern Ireland, which has seen sustained disorder since last weekend, police said they were investigating a suspected racially motivated hate crime overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A petrol bomb was thrown at a mosque in Newtownards, east of Belfast, in the early hours of Saturday, with graffiti sprayed on the front door and walls of the building, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the petrol bomb thrown at the property did not ignite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is being treated as a racially motivated hate crime, and I want to send a strong message to those who carried this out, that this type of activity will not be tolerated and any reports of hate crime are taken very seriously," PSNI Chief Inspector Keith Hutchinson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also overnight reports of damage to property and vehicles in Belfast, as nightly unrest there rumbled on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbances in Northern Ireland were sparked by events in England but have also been fuelled by pro-UK loyalist paramilitaries with their own agenda, according to the PSNI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 5,000 anti-racism demonstrators rallied in Belfast on Saturday without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, hundreds massed outside the office of Brexit architect Nigel Farage's Reform UK party before marching to parliament, as a large police presence looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage and other far-right figures have been blamed for helping to fuel the riots through anti-immigrant rhetoric and conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really important for people of colour in this country, for immigrants in this country, to see us out here as white British people saying 'no, we don't stand for this'," said attendee Phoebe Sewell, 32, from London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow Londoner Jeremy Snelling, 64, said he had turned out because "I don't like the right-wing claiming the streets in my name."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not hold Farage "personally responsible" for the violence but argued that the Reform party founder had "contributed" to the volatile environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he is damaging and I think he's dangerous," Snelling added. (AFP)

    Mission accomplished: China sweeps all diving golds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed an historic clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after Cao Yuan retained his 10m platform title to make it eight wins out of eight for the powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As much as the nation has dominated the sport in recent years, it has never taken home every gold medal at a single Games. It came close twice in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, with seven wins
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the once-elusive achievement did not come easy. Cao was locked in a tight battle against Japan's Rikuto Tamai, with the pair separated by less than three points after four rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that all changed in the penultimate round, when Tamai committed a serious error on his routine and dropped out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao finished with 547.50 points after six rounds, compared to 507.65 for the Japanese, which was good for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noah Williams of Great Britain propelled himself to a bronze with a sensational final dive worth 94.35 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Yang Hao, the reigning world champion who beat his compatriot Cao at the World Aquatics Championships in Doha in February, not only was a surprise omission from the podium, but finished last out of the 12 finalists.

    LA planning 'No Car' Olympics to beat gridlock

File photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765668_1_20240810223516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles 2028 organisers said on Saturday they will force spectators to take public transportation to Olympic venues and encourage remote working in a bid to sidestep the gridlocked city's notorious traffic problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said 2028 chiefs want the LA Olympics to be "The No Car Games" by investing in public transportation and encouraging Angelenos to adopt pandemic-style remote-working for the duration of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'No Car Games' means that you will have to take public transportation to get to all of the venues," Bass told a press conference ahead of Sunday's Paris Olympics closing ceremony. "In order to do that we have been building out our transportation system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan would require borrowing more than 3,000 buses from other parts of the United States, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass was adamant however that Los Angeles's traffic, where rush hour congestion can lead to car journeys of just a few miles taking an hour or more, would not be a problem, citing the history of the 1984 Olympics in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 1984 Angelenos were terrified that we were going to have terrible, terrible traffic," she said. "And we were shocked that we didn't. And in 1984 we didn't have any of the technology that we do today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that city officials 40 years ago encouraged employers to stagger shifts or allowed workers to work remotely to great success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we can do that again," Bass said. "So part of having a no-car Olympics means getting people not to drive, but also using public transportation to get to the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We certainly learned from Covid that you have essential workers, people that must come to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if you limit it to that, it's going to be a lot easier because we did go through Covid. So people will have some reference point in recent history as to how you can do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass said the city would also aim to house Los Angeles's estimated 75,500 homeless population before the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if Los Angeles would follow Paris' example by moving several thousand homeless people in the build-up to the Olympics to locations outside the city, Bass replied: "We are going to get Angelenos housed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is what we have been doing and we're going to continue to do that. We will get people housed, we will get them off the street." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's rhythmic gymnasts won the group all-around final at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with Israel taking silver and Italy completing the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each team of five gymnasts had to produce their best performances with five hoops, as well as three ribbons and two balls. The scores were then added up to create a final total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the scoreboard with 36.950 points in the first routine with hoops and a medley of five musical compositions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team continued their strong performance with ribbons and balls to score 32.850, to a total of 69.800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China took home gold by a 0.950-point gap to beat Israel, who came in second with a cumulative of 68.850 points. Italy scored 68.100 to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bulgaria, who won gold at the Tokyo Games, narrowly missed out on a medal despite an impressive comeback from an initial mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team received the highest score in the second routine, recovering from an error in the first performance where two hoops clashed in the air.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese weightlifter Liu Huanhua on Saturday won the men's 120-kilogramme division in his debut at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He got to 186 kilogrammes in the snatch at the South Paris Arena, and lifted 220 kilogrammes in his first clean and jerk attempt before failing the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old completed four out of six lifts but it was enough for him to finish with a total score of 406, beating Uzbekistan's Akbar Djuraev by two kilos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djuraev also failed the final two attempts in the clean and jerk. Yauheni Tsikhantsou took home the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu previously set world records in both the clean and jerk at 232 kilogrammes, as well as the total of 413 kilogrammes in his weight class during the IWF World Cup in Phuket this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopian Tamirat Tola delivered a masterclass in solo front running to win the Olympic men's marathon in Paris on Saturday as Eliud Kipchoge's bid for a third gold went up in smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tola clocked an Olympic record of two hours  six minutes and 26 seconds for victory, finishing 21 seconds ahead of Belgium's Bashir Abdi, whose silver marked an upgrade from his bronze garnered at the Covid-hit Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Benson Kipruto, winner of Tokyo, Boston and Chicago marathons in recent years, rounded out the podium, a further 13 seconds adrift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you, Paris!" said Tola, the 2016 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist who will be 33 on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy today, I was 2022 world champion and now I'm Olympic champion. It's the greatest day in my life. This was my goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team fielded three long-distance runners in the event, with Wu Xiangdong finishing 40th with a time of two hours, 12 minutes and 34 seconds. Yang Shaohui came in 55th with a time of two hours, 14 minutes and 48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s third runner, He Jie, needed two hours 22 minutes and 31 seconds to finish the race, finishing 67th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km-long marathon course headed out of central Paris on a loop to Versailles.
  <br/>
  The route included a 436m climb and 438m descent. The maximum gradient on the route was 13.5 percent. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Gaza civil defence says 93 dead in Israeli strike

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Displaced Palestinians gather in the yard of a school hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza City. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765635_1_20240810170902.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced Palestinians killed 93 people, as Israel's military accused militants of using the building as a command centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas denounced the "dangerous escalation" in north Gaza, which came after international mediators invited the warring sides to resume next Thursday talks towards a long-sought ceasefire and hostage-release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry said the timing of the school strike "is an indication of the Israeli government's efforts to obstruct and thwart these efforts".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence in the Hamas-ruled territory said three Israeli missiles hit the school in Gaza City while people performed dawn prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their bodies were torn apart," civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. "It reminds us of the first days of the war in the Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced during the war started by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings, which have been hit at least 14 times since July 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army said on Saturday it had "precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the Al-Tabieen school".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has repeatedly made similar accusations after strikes on the school shelters. Hamas has previously denied Israeli claims that it uses schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities for military aims. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded more than 45,300 crimes during the first half of the year, a 5.6 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deception made up about 40 percent of all cases. Victims – who were mostly scammed online – were swindled out of HK$4.48 billion in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the number of "Guess Who" phone scams were down by 61 percent, the force pointed out that fraudsters had adopted new tactics such as impersonating staff of e-shopping and online payment platforms, and telecommunications companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force also revealed that its robbery detection rate of 84.1 percent was the highest since it started maintaining statistics for the period in 1977, with police stepping up anti-burglary patrols, especially in areas with village houses. Officers noted they used drones and partnered with the Government Flying Service to carry out air patrols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of June 30 this year, 300 arrests have been made under the National Security Law that was put in place four years ago, it added. About 60 percent of those arrested have been charged.

 Over 1,000 policymakers, researchers and young entrepreneurs gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre on Saturday for the city's first youth development summit, organised by the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee said young people should learn from the Olympic spirit and be inspired by Hong Kong's young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we can't all be Olympic champions, we can all be champions of our own stories. We can all live in the spirit of the Olympic motto, faster, higher, stronger, together, in our pursuit," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong also attended the summit, where she showed her medal from the Paris Games to audience members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, who won gold in the women's individual epee, said she was initially very nervous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time I was nervous, I would turn and channel all that energy into training. So the more nervous I got, the more training I did, and that gave me the confidence to be like: okay, I am doing everything I can to fence the best that I can at the Olympics and I shouldn't be scared, I shouldn't be worried about the results", the 30-year-old fencer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said that the government's youth development blueprint could provide all-round support to its targeted beneficiaries of those aged between 12 and 39.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blueprint was rolled out in December 2022, with around 60 additional measures added last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them includes the Member Self-recommendation Scheme for youth. The government is working to triple the number of participating advisory committees to not less than 180 in the current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To date, 85 government advisory committees have joined the scheme, covering trade and industry, innovation and technology, human resources planning, child affairs, and much more," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that the energy, creativity, and resilience of young people will help create a better future.
