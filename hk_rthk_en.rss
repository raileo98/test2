<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane received the Golden Shoe award as the highest goalscorer in a European football league at a ceremony in the Bavarian capital on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kane scored 36 goals during the previous Bundesliga season, more than any other player in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being the top Premier League scorer three times, Kane had never won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a fantastic feeling," Kane said."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The award is for everyone. Without you, I wouldn't be standing here today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel good and am looking forward to the new season. I feel a new energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud to receive this award."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prize was the latest won by the striker in a long list of personal awards, but Kane is still yet to win a team title in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane went trophyless in his debut year in Munich, the first time Bayern finished a season without silverware since 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters "I want to continue on as I started last season, but it is important to win titles. We want to achieve success as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane's tally of 36 goals in 32 Bayern appearances is just five shy of the single-season record held by former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski of 41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England captain was handed the award by Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen, who praised Kane's character since making the move to Munich one season ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Created in the 1967-68 season, the Golden Shoe was formerly awarded to the top scorer in any European league, but in 1997 was changed to use a ranking system which favours players in higher-ranked leagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With six wins, Lionel Messi has received the award more than anyone else. Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland have previously won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is something special that I am now mentioned in the same breath as these names," Kane said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The protests over the gruesome rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata continue. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767902_1_20240828013657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in India fired tear gas and water cannon on Tuesday as they clashed with thousands of protesters seeking justice for a doctor who was raped and murdered in Kolkata this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a state-run hospital in the eastern city stoked nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's demonstration saw thousands march to a government building in Kolkata to demand the resignation of Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They shouted slogans and clashed with police, who charged the crowd with batons in an effort to disperse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namita Ghosh, a college student who attended the protest, said that the crowd had intended to "protest peacefully" before the baton charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 100 protesters "have been arrested on the charge of creating violence," a senior police official said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous protests in Kolkata prompted by the crime have transformed into unruly political rallies, with police scuffling with demonstrators from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) angry at the state government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but it is an opposition party in West Bengal, of which Kolkata is the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have accused Banerjee's government of creating an unsafe environment for women that allowed crimes including the doctor's murder to occur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman's body was found in the teaching hospital's seminar hall, suggesting she had gone there for a break during a 36-hour shift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doctors' associations in many cities launched strikes over the murder that cut off non-essential services, though medical professionals have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained over the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gruesome nature of the attack has invoked comparisons with the horrific 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That incident sparked widespread outrage in a country where sexual violence against women is endemic, with an average of nearly 90 rapes a day were reported in 2022 in the country of 1.4 billion people. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Owners of the US National Football League (NFL) are set to vote on Tuesday on allowing private equity investment, a move that could offer an influx of cash for new stadiums and other projects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the vote, the NFL's 32 owners are likely to allow private equity firms to purchase up to a 10 percent team stake, according to a CNBC report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of companies that have been approved plan to commit US$12 billion in capital over time, CNBC added, citing people familiar with the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each fund or consortium can make deals with up to six teams, and the firms which have been green-lit include Ares Management, Sixth Street Partners and Arctos Partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also a consortium including names like Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other large sports leagues like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association already allow private equity ownership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the NFL – the most popular and prosperous US league – formed a committee to consider allowing private equity funding, and it has recently met with the companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With rising valuations of NFL teams, fewer potential owners can come up with full funding when teams are on the market. (AFP)

    US consumer confidence up slightly in August

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The modest rise in consumer confidence is likely to be well-received by Vice President Kamala Harris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767898_1_20240828001001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer confidence in the United States rose slightly in August, according to survey data published on Tuesday, beating expectations and extending a recent increase in optimism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Conference Board's consumer confidence index inched higher to 103.3 in August, up slightly from a revised figure of 101.9 a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was comfortably above market expectations, according to Briefing.com.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The modest rise is likely to be well-received by US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against former president Donald Trump in November's elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two candidates have looked to talk up their respective economic records, with the cost of living and inflation playing a major role in the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall consumer confidence rose in August but remained within the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years," Conference Board chief economist Dana Peterson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers continued to express mixed feelings in August," she added. "Compared to July, they were more positive about business conditions, both current and future, but also more concerned about the labour market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month's US jobs report came in well below expectations, setting off a brief fall in stock markets and raising fears of recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, markets stabilised almost as rapidly as they had fallen, and monetary policymakers have stressed that the labour market remains relatively strong by historical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers' assessments of the current labour situation, while still positive, continued to weaken, and assessments of the labour market going forward were more pessimistic," Peterson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer confidence declined for people under the age of 35, although young people remained the most optimistic age group, according to Peterson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a disparity based on income, with consumers earning more than US$100,000 a year feeling the most confident, and those on salaries of less than US$25,000 noting a decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The index continues to waffle in a narrow range, much like other measures of consumer spirits," Navy Federal Credit Union corporate economist Robert Frick said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may take a major shift, such as significantly lower interest rates or the expansion getting a second wind, before we see optimism rise to pre-2020 levels," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation expectations dropped to 4.9 percent in August, their lowest level since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Conference Board said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer expectations of higher interest rates in the next 12 months fell for the third consecutive month, hitting the lowest level since February this year. (AFP)

    India's Jay Shah to be cricket world body chairman

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's cricket chief Jay Shah has been elected unopposed as chairman of the sport's world body, the International Cricket Council, it said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shah will take over the role from December, after current Chair Greg Barclay decided not to seek a third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and our member nations to further globalise cricket," Shah said, adding he was "humbled" by the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From being the chief of the world's richest cricket board to leading the ICC, the 35-year-old's meteoric rise illustrates India's domination of the sport's global administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a country where the sport and politics go hand in glove, Shah is best known for being the son of home minister Amit Shah, the right-hand man of Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah, the powerful Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India since 2019, becomes the youngest ICC chairman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top cricketers in India enjoy superstardom with millions of die-hard fans, most lucrative playing contracts, and endorsement deals not seen anywhere else in global cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By some counts, Indian cricket on average generates more revenue than Bollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 percent of the sport's billion-plus worldwide fans are in the Indian subcontinent, according to a 2018 ICC study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICC is the global governing body for cricket, with more than 100 members, and is responsible for staging global events such as the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah said he wanted to "embrace fresh thinking and innovation to elevate the love for cricket worldwide." (AFP)

    UN nuclear head at Russian plant warns over fighting

    <![CDATA[<img alt='General Director of the IAEA Rafael Grossi says he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767893_1_20240827225153.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN nuclear watchdog head Rafael Grossi on Tuesday warned during a visit to Russia's Kursk nuclear plant that its proximity to ongoing fighting was "extremely serious" following Ukraine's unprecedented cross-border offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi said his tour enabled him to "look at the most important parts" of the plant, which is less than 50 kilometres from fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A nuclear power plant of this type so close to a point of contact or military front is an extremely serious fact," Grossi said after visiting the plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact we have military activity a few kilometres, a few miles away from here, make it an immediate point of attention," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the end of the day, again, this may sound common sense and simple: Don't attack a nuclear power plant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, adding it was "important to talk" and "keep dialogue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Kursk power plant currently was "operating in a very close to normal conditions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned of the dangers of fighting around nuclear plants following Russia's full-scale military offensive into Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first days of the conflict, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, and also briefly held the decommissioned Chernobyl plant in the north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine launched its surprise incursion into Kursk on August 6 and has said it is making advances, even as Russian forces move deeper into eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Ukraine of trying to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant, with drone fragments found near its spent nuclear fuel storage facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was informed about the impact of drones, I was shown some of the remnants of those, signs of impact they had," Grossi said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant lies some 60 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border, next to the Seym river, and less than 50 kilometres away from Kursk city, the region's capital with a population of around 440,000. (AFP)

    Israeli army says hostage rescued from Gaza

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said it rescued an Israeli hostage in Gaza on Tuesday after a "complex operation", as the Israel-Hamas war, now in its 11th month, showed no signs of abating.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kaid Alkadi, a 52-year-old Israeli Bedouin, was abducted by Palestinian militants during the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kaid Alkadi was rescued... in a complex operation in the southern Gaza Strip," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is in a stable medical condition and is being transferred for medical checks to a hospital."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alkadi is a resident of Rahat, a mainly Arab town, and on October 7 he had been working as a guard at a warehouse in southern Israel when he was seized by militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to seizing every opportunity to bring the hostages back to their homes," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the rescue of Alkadi was "miraculous".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we must remember that military operations alone cannot free the remaining hostages who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror," it said, insisting only a ceasefire could ensure the return of other captives", it said adding that "a negotiated deal is the only way forward".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On October 7, militants attacked southern Israeli communities in an unprecedented attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 104 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign since then has killed at least 40,476 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory. Most of the dead are women and children, according to UN rights office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the United Nations said humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip has taken a serious blow after Israel ordered a new evacuation in the centre of the besieged territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday the Israeli military ordered people to "evacuate immediately" a part of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, sparking a rapid exodus of civilians and displacing UN and NGO workers. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications for more than 7,100 government-subsidised homes will open in the fourth quarter of this year, with households that have newborns being given priority when selecting homes for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new units in the latest round of the Home Ownership Scheme are from five estates – in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Yau Tong, Tung Chung and Tuen Mun – and priced from HK$1.43 million to HK$4.67 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants are expected to be able to select subsidised homes from the second quarter of 2025, which are marked with a 30 percent discount, smaller than the previous batch's offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleresa Wong, who chairs the Housing Authority's subsidised housing committee, said the monthly median income of target buyers has risen, meaning they are more capable of affording such homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also brushed aside concerns that a downturn in the property market would affect the sale of these homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not compare these prices with that in the private market because our target buyers are different. The buyers we want to help are those whom we have determined are unable to purchase a private market flat," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about how popular these homes will be. There are a lot of people who we have to help."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority has also set aside 40 percent of the flats, or 2,900 of them, for ballots from households with elderly members or newborns, who will have priority when choosing their desired homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a bid to boost the city's birth rate, families with children aged three years or younger at the time of application and those who are born on or after October 25 last year will have a better chance of buying subsidised flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said successful applicants with priority are no longer picking from the entire pool of available flats, and instead each housing project will have a set proportion of units for them to choose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”This time, we hope that applicants will have a more reasonable chance of selecting the unit they want," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have noticed that in the past, people with priority tended to prefer homes with better locations and those that are larger."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 10 percent of homes are earmarked for single-person household applicants, Wong added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, families of two or more who are "white form" applicants will be subject to a monthly income ceiling of HK$60,000, from the previous HK$62,000, and an asset limit of HK$1.23 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount will be halved for single-person households.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s export figures have improved for the fifth consecutive month, rising 13.1 percent to HK$390.4 billion in July, when compared to the same month last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Tuesday showed imports rose 9.9 percent year-on-year to HK$412.3 billion, which left the city with a trade deficit of HK$21.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to the mainland, the United States and the European Union continued to rise, while sales to other major Asian markets had a mixed performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combining the figures for the first seven months of the year, exports jumped 12.4 percent year-on-year, while imports rose 8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said Hong Kong's exports should remain positive as long as external demand holds up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the spokesperson added that there are still risks associated with geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts.

    Don't overlook palliative care for children: medics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chan Cheong-wai (bottom second right) says parents often prioritise seeking curative treatments, overlooking palliative care for their children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767858_1_20240827172850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paediatricians and scholars on Tuesday said parents should not overlook palliative care when their children are confronting complex diseases or symptoms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palliative care, which includes end-of-life care, is a specialised type of care aimed at alleviating pain and other symptoms associated with severe illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The call came after researchers at Polytechnic University interviewed 65 people, including children aged between eight and 19 years old, their parents, and medics between 2019 and 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Professor Frances Wong from the university's nursing school said parents need to understand how to live with the life-long diseases their children are facing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The point of treatment and diagnosis is not the end, it's just the beginning. How the parents actually face living with the disease and, therefore, a palliative care model
  <br/>
  actually has the benefits to provide that continuity of care," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that parents can start palliative care for their children even before the diagnosis is complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chan Cheong-wai, who chairs the Hong Kong Society of Children's Palliative Care, said diagnosing intricate illnesses often takes years, but parents often focus on seeking curative treatments, overseeing palliative care for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If a child had cancer, the first thing that the parents may think about will be any kind of curative treatment,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So at that juncture, most of the doctors and nurses will focus on the curative treatment instead of other elements like psychological support. We are not saying that psychological support is not important, but at that time, the parents' main focus is still on the medical side."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children says not many people in the childcare sector are experienced in looking after very young children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767850_1_20240827164639.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) on Tuesday urged the government to provide more support for parents, to boost the city's fertility rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The society said it conducted a survey from May to June involving 1,200 women who had one child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 30 percent said they would have another child, while the rest were either undecided or said they would not have any more children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reasons for ruling out a second child included the financial burden, heavy parenting responsibilities and the difficulty in balancing work and childcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKSPC director Subrina Chow said the government will make available 900 additional places in day childcare services over the next few years, but the number is still inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the long-term development of Hong Kong, in terms of helping more women or adults to be able to join the workforce and helping to increase birth rates so as to address the issues of an ageing population, we feel the government could make further investment in this area because that's going to benefit the society as a whole," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow added that not many people in the childcare sector are experienced in looking after very young children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current programmes provided by our universities and training institutions are all focused on the three to six age range, so we do need a lot more programme content to be devoted to the younger children," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive introduced a HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies in last year's policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chow said parents want "long-term" support instead, so the authorities should consider offering more parental leave as well as child healthcare vouchers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official data shows the number of births in the SAR dropped from 91,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials on Tuesday said a transformed museum documenting the War of Resistance will open to the public next week to showcase relics from the war and the country's history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On September 3, the existing Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence will be renamed the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said officials would work with their Shenzhen counterparts to organise thematic exhibitions on the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The words 'War of Resistance' demonstrate the museum's theme of commemorating the history of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and inheriting the patriotic spirit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also aligns with the high respect for the heroes and martyrs of the War of Resistance and warns future generations to cherish peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression was one of the theatres of World War 2 in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Yui-sum, director of the Museum of History, told reporters there will be new features and performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We aim to organise more exhibitions and public programmes [for] the general public to let them know more about the War of Resistance history and the significance of this period of time, so that they can establish their self-esteem of being a Chinese and to let them know more about their motherland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said in his 2023 Policy Address that the new museum would focus on the war of resistance to cultivate a stronger sense of national esteem and patriotism.

    Britpop band Oasis to reunite next year

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oasis will reunite for a tour, the Britpop band known for their timeless hits like “Wonderwall” and “Don't Look Back in Anger” announced Tuesday, ending a 15-year hiatus and, presumably, the long-held feud between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The guitar band said tickets for the 14-date tour will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday. The tour will begin July 4-5, 2025 in Cardiff, Wales, before moving on to four dates in Manchester, four at London's Wembley stadium, two in Edinburgh and two in Dublin where the tour will conclude on Aug. 17, the band said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is it. This is happening,″ the band said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oasis split in 2009 after many years of infighting, with Noel Gallagher officially leaving the band just before a performance at a festival near Paris. Even before the dissolution, the brothers had long had an antagonistic relationship and reportedly did not speak to each other for years after the breakup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer,” Noel Gallagher, the band's guitarist and songwriter, wrote in a statement at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the Gallagher brothers haven’t performed together since, both regularly perform Oasis songs at their solo gigs. They've also each fired off criticisms of the other in the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noel Gallagher accused his younger brother of having a hangover that forced them to cancel a 2009 concert. The frontman disputed the accusation and sued, later dropping the lawsuit. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Tuesday arrived in Beijing where he will hold talks with senior officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a three-day visit aimed at easing tensions between the two countries ahead of the November presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sullivan's plane landed just before 2pm and was greeted at the airport by US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan wants to expand military-to-military talks between the China and the US down to the theatre command level, a move Washington hopes could help manage tensions in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US also wants China to take more action at home to prevent the development of chemicals that can be made into fentanyl, the leading cause of American drug overdoses, and reach an understanding about safety standards for artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing plans to express its disapproval over US tariffs on a range of manufactured goods and export controls targeting Chinese chip makers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US has continuously taken unreasonable measures against China in terms of tariffs, export controls, investment reviews and unilateral sanctions, which have seriously undermined China's legitimate rights and interests," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency said Sullivan's visit will mark the start of a new round of strategic communication between the two sides. "This visit is another opportunity for both nations to stabilise their bilateral relationship and seek common ground amid rising global uncertainties," Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Sullivan's first visit to China and the first by a US national security advisor to the country in eight years. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Malaysian opposition leader and former premier Muhyiddin Yassin waves he leaves the Gua Musang Sessions Court in Gua Musang, Malaysia. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767830_1_20240827145801.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was charged on Tuesday with sedition over a speech he made that allegedly questioned the integrity of the country's previous king.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin, who led Malaysia from March 2020 until August 2021, pleaded not guilty in a court in northeast Kelantan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the charge sheet, Muhyiddin made the seditious remarks last month during a by-election campaign in Kelantan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine ethnic Malay state rulers take turns as Malaysia’s king for five-year terms under the country’s rotating monarchy, which began when Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but are revered by the nation's majority Muslims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his speech on August 14, Muhyiddin had questioned why then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah didn't invite him to be prime minister following a hung Parliament in November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin had claimed he had the backing of majority lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin's Islamic nationalistic bloc received stronger-than-expected support from Malays, who account for two-thirds of Malaysia’s 34 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah appointed then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister after Anwar cobbled up support from rival parties to form a unity government.

  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah from central Pahang state, who ended his reign in January this year, didn't comment on the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his son issued a strong rebuke to Muhyiddin, saying his remarks were dangerous and could divide the people and undermine the royal institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin was questioned by police following complaints against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied insulting the royalty, saying his remarks were factual and that he had handed in a sworn oath of support by 115 lawmakers in the 222-member parliament. (AP)

    HKU to trial use of sound waves to treat cancer

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong's faculty of medicine says it is planning the first clinical trials in Asia of a device designed to treat cancer with sound waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty liver cancer patients will be given histotripsy treatment at Queen Mary Hospital from September, the faculty said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The histotripsy is basically a very high-focus ultrasound that basically induces a sudden expansion and collapse of the cancer cells… and that creates a shock wave and that basically would break down the cancer cells and we call it liquefying the cancer cells. That would completely kill the cancer cells,” said professor Albert Chan from the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And what is so different from the usual treatment is actually the minimally invasiveness. So without any scars, any wounds, we can now treat the patients... This is a non-radiation treatment, so we can actually apply it to a broad spectrum of patients.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Hong Kong, with about 1,700 to 1,800 new cases per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mike Blue – a representative of the manufacturer of the machine involved – said the technology could be used to treat most cancers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This particular system has been designed in the future to treat everywhere really from the neck down. So we envision years from now, histotripsy and this particular system will be used to treat thyroid, breast, sarcomas, liver, kidney, pancreas, really anywhere in the body,” the HistoSonics CEO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue added that the treatment is also effective on recurrent cancer patients, adding that it has already been used in the US on those with early and advanced stages of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that after the clinical trial on liver cancer at HKU is completed in about two years, the team plans to carry out clinical studies in the SAR for other types of cancer, including kidney and pancreatic cancer.

 The president of Macau's Court of Final Appeal, Sam Hou-fai, will meet the press tomorrow to formally declare his bid to become the SAR's top leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tuesday marked his last day as head and member of the top court of the casino hub, as well as a member of the Independent Commission on the Recommendation of Judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng removed Sam from his duties, as per his request, with the removal order taking effect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam had earlier expressed his interest in running to become Macau's next chief executive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Ho announced last Wednesday that he would not run for a second term due to health reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nomination period for candidates begins on Thursday, with the election to be held on October 13.

    'Uni town to cover 30 hectares of Yuen Long village'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Almost half of a planned academic town near the border will be built on land in a rural village in Yuen Long, according to Development Secretary Bernadette Linn.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Northern Metropolis University Town" will be for local educational institutions to strengthen cooperation with their mainland and overseas counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town, as part of the massive Northern Metropolis project, will cover more than 60 hectares at Hung Shui Kiu, Ha Tsuen, Ngau Tam Mei and a new town in the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said some 20 hectares of the academic district would be around Ping Che and Ta Kwu Ling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also reserve about 30 hectares of land in Ngau Tam Mei for the district, Linn said, adding that a full development plan for the village could be unveiled after October's policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ngau Tam Mei is very close to the San Tin Technopole. They are only one station apart. For the future Northern Link, there will be a station at San Tin and the next southbound station will be Ngau Tam Mei," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that the education district in Ngau Tam Mei should be somewhat related to the San Tin Technopole, innovation and technology, and scientific research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government will press ahead with the massive development in the New Territories, after the High Court granted an application for a judicial review of the government's decision to approve the environmental study of the San Tin Technopole project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, the development chief reiterated that the government is pushing back the reclamation process off Lantau, but isn't scrapping the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are indeed behind the original schedule, but we are not shelving the project. I am concerned that the word 'suspend' may sometimes make people feel that we are putting it down," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We may also prolong the reclamation process, because we certainly have room to think about how many phases the project should be divided into for the 1,000 hectares of reclaimed land."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian authorities issued new air raid alerts across the country on Tuesday as Russian bombers took to the skies, a day after Moscow carried out a "massive" attack on Ukraine's power grid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia fired hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukraine on Monday, killing at least four people and battering the country's already weakened energy grid, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian attack triggered widespread blackouts and came after Kyiv claimed new advances in its incursion in Russia's Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's air force confirmed early Tuesday the "takeoff of several Tu-95MS from the Engels airfield" in western Russia, prompting air raid alerts across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three more people were killed in overnight Russian attacks, according to local officials, two in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rig and one in southeastern Zaporizhzhia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched at least 127 missiles and 109 drones in "one of the largest Russian attacks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of those, 102 missiles and 99 drones were shot down, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk, who described it as Russia's "most massive" attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and Britain both condemned the assault, with US President Joe Biden calling it "outrageous" and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy branding it "cowardly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany's foreign ministry said that "once again, Putin's Russia is saturating Ukraine's lifelines with missiles". (AFP)

    China raises strong objections to Canada tariffs

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767796_1_20240827112608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's embassy in Canada on Tuesday raised its "strong dissatisfaction" over Ottawa's plans to impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This move is typical trade protectionism and politically motivated decision," a spokesperson said in a statement on the embassy's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will damage trade and economic cooperation between China and Canada, hurt the interests of Canadian consumers and enterprises (and) slow down the green transition process of Canada," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said Canada's move "will disrupt the stability of global industrial and supply chains" and seriously undermine the global economic system and economic and trade rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Canadian side claims to support free trade and the multilateral trading system based on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but it flagrantly violates WTO rules, blindly follows individual countries, and announces that it will adopt unilateral tariff measures, which is typical trade protectionism," the spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has maintained that its electric vehicle industry does not rely on subsidies to gain a competitive edge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its production keeps prices low for global consumers and will aid a transition to the green economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also unveiled a 25 percent surtax on imports of Chinese steel and aluminium products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a news conference in Halifax, Trudeau said Chinese EV overproduction and hefty state subsidies for its auto sector "requires us to take action."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unless we want to get in a race to the bottom, we have to stand up, and that's what we're doing," he said, adding the tariffs were a response to "this extraordinary threat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and the European Union have in recent months imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs of 100 percent and 38 percent, respectively. (Agencies)

    US rate cut 'should spark demand for new property'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chairman of Professional Property Services Group, Nicholas Brooke, said developers would have to be competitive on pricing. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767774_1_20240827093321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Professional Property Services Group, Nicholas Brooke, says he thinks an interest rate cut in the US will spark demand for residential property purchases here, although developers will have to be competitive on pricing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think we have to be honest. There's a greater degree of optimism now with the news about likely interest rate cuts by the Fed so that's feeding through into the market. I think if you ask me about market sentiment, I would say the market remains cautious but there is a greater degree of optimism," he said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the reality is that after 18 months of treading water, if you like, there's significant latent demand from both first-time buyers and upgraders so the demand is there I'm sure."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Friday Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said it was time for the US to start cutting interest rates and with the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar, that should mean lower borrowing costs here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said there was an estimated surplus of 20,000 to 22,000 unsold new private units, which was equivalent to at least half a year's supply. He said 7,000 to 10,000 could be sold by the end of the year and the remainder could probably be sold by the middle of next year. But he said this would mean developers would have to be competitive on pricing for at least the next 12 months or so to work through this inventory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke also said he didn't expect private residential rents to fall in the near term, even though he saw pent-up demand to buy new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I actually see rents going up. We've got the talent scheme and there's quite significant demand from the student community for rental accommodation. We're short of private rental stock in Hong Kong. If anything, I think rents may well rise in the short and medium term because there is demand, and it's real demand," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Brooke said the situation for commercial rents was very poor with prime office buildings in top locations in some cases being half empty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, the office market is in some disarray from a vacancy and occupancy perspective," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are two major buildings in Central, which are probably 40-to-50 percent let, struggling to find new tenants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said the commercial market was very soft generally and that was a function of the economy at large.

    More opt for green burial for sense of comfort

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green burial is becoming increasingly popular in Hong Kong as people look for a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to handle the ashes of their loved ones.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An academic said the trend could mean less demand for public columbariums and niches, which would have a positive impact on Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department showed that the number of green burials in Hong Kong almost tripled in the past decade, to 9,381 last year from 3,400 in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green burial refers to scattering the ashes of your loved ones in gardens of remembrance or at designated waters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo, a Hongkonger who now lives in Australia, scattered the ashes of his father at sea in accordance with his wishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He loved to travel... and I feel that he could enjoy his freedoms in the sea after his death," Leo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that sea burial brought him closer to his father.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because he's already in the sea, I can look out at the sea and feel like I'm talking to him wherever he goes. I imagine he's with me in Australia. I can say 'Hello, how are you?' to him anytime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine, meanwhile, chose a different final resting place for her mother, whose ashes were scattered at a garden of remembrance at Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine said that symbolised a sense of comfort and freedom for her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they scatter the ashes in the garden, it's like return to the nature and close to ground and close to us... that's where they land and where they choose, and they feel comfortable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some way, they feel like a bit of free up after their death."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine, who now lives in Australia, said she likes to see more flexibility in funeral arrangements in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, it's very common in Australia for green burial... There are many choices... A lot of people feel if they scatter their ashes on a garden, and then they grow a tree of some sort, and they feel very romantic and like an extension of life. They choose where they want to finish. And so it's pretty flexible in Australia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amy Chow, a professor of social work at the University of Hong Kong, said people have opted for green burial as they become more aware of the environment.

  <br/>
  "Because of the traditional belief, if you put your essentials in a cemetery, most of the time when you worship, you will burn paper offerings, you will burn incense. And this is also not good for the environment. But if you scatter the ashes in the nature, you just like, you just need to look up to the sky and say your prayers in your heart, and it won't cause anything to the environment," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow hopes that with more burial options available, there will be less demand for public columbariums and niches and the city can make better use of our land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She believes the trend of green burial will continue to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there are more choices, I do think it will diversify the choices and then the number demanding traditional way will be reduced... Actually in the free market, Hong Kong people are still having a lot of choices, like they can turn the ashes into diamond, into artwork, into glassware. And also they may bring it to this space through private service, via, you know, Nasa.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Olympics champion Zheng Qinwen rallied from a set down to beat Amanda Anisimova 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Monday and reach the second round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  American Anisimova had Zheng on the run early, but the world number seven from China was able to turn things around for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 triumph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was especially pleased to build on the momentum of her Paris Games triumph, which made her the first Olympic singles champion from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the typical match I will lose, especially after huge success," Zheng said. "Usually after huge success I will get a little bit too high, until the reality slap me down again and I come back to the ground and trying to be humble and work hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng, 21, said before the US Open that she wanted to avoid that kind of let-down, but Anisimova didn't make it easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was really difficult, the match today," she said. "She's hitting the ball very strong and the only things I feel like I can do today during the match is just to stay with her and find my moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventh-seeded Zheng next faces Erika Andreeva of Russia, who beat China's Yuan Yue 6-3, 7-6. (AFP)

    Gauff cruises into second round at US Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gauff celebrates after winning match point over France's Varvara Gracheva. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767766_1_20240827074406.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff launched her US Open title defence with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Varvara Gracheva on Monday, firing 10 aces and saving eight break points to advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old American worked through some tight moments early on to polish off the victory in 66 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, where she captured her first Grand Slam title last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was breezing through the second set when France's Gracheva, ranked 66th in the world, mustered a pair of break points in the final game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff saved both with aces as she booked a second-round meeting with Tatjana Maria of Germany, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Argentina's Solana Sierra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I served well," Gauff said. "Can't ask for a better start into this tournament, so hoping to continue to get better as the week, two weeks go by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff's build-up to the final Grand Slam of the season has been less than ideal. She fell in the third round at Toronto and lost her first match as the defending champion in Cincinnati.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said taking the long view was helping her stay steady as she tries for the first time to defend a major title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last couple of weeks were tough, and I was, like, 'I have to do this and do that.' But I don't have to prove anything to anyone except myself," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that perspective, "and just having the belief that I can but not the expectation that I should" had tamped down the pressure. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day mixed on Monday, as another Federal Reserve policymaker came out in favour of starting interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is "hard to imagine" not cutting interest rates in September, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Monday, a few days after Fed chair Jerome Powell said the time had come to start adjusting monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The direction of change is down, and the time to adjust is now," Daly said, signalling her support for a rate cut at the Fed's rate meeting next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 41,240.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent to 5,616, while the Nasdaq lost 0.9 percent, closing at 17,725.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think people used today as an opportunity to take some near-term profits," said Sam Stovall, from CFRA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech stocks slipped, with Nvidia finishing the day down 2.3 percent ahead of quarterly earnings results on Wednesday. Broadcom slipped more than four percent. (AFP)

    UN says movement of aid, aid workers in Gaza halted

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Israeli military has told people in Deir al-Balah to evacuate immediately. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767753_1_20240827033817.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations said on Monday it had to halt the movement of aid and aid workers within Gaza due to a new Israeli evacuation order for the Deir al-Balah area, which had become a hub for its workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A senior UN official had earlier said that UN operations had stopped completely within the Strip, but officials later clarified that operations "in situ" and "embedded" with local populations would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the official, the UN had relocated most of its personnel in operations to Deir al-Balah following a Rafah evacuation order several months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said on Monday it was targeting "terror operatives" in Deir al-Balah and working to dismantle the remaining "infrastructure" of Hamas, whose October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has told people to evacuate immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the UN humanitarian agency (Ocha), 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers and four UN warehouses were affected, being either in or near the area ordered to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After it appeared that the UN had shut down its Gaza operations, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, clarified that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees was continuing operations, although under restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What our senior UN official was referring to is UN officials and UN humanitarian staff moving about," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If humanitarian workers are embedded with a certain population in a certain area, they have the tools to operate and to share and to distribute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They will do so," he added, though warning that it would be "half a drop in a barrel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam Rose, senior deputy field director for Unrwa in Gaza, added that "health services continue across eight or nine primary healthcare centres and over 90 health points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But indeed, the space and the ability of the UN system, of the humanitarian system to operate in Gaza is becoming increasingly difficult," Rose added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Sox catcher Danny Jansen became the first player in major league history to appear in the same game for both teams when he took the field for Boston on Monday in the resumption of a rain-delayed game he started for Toronto in June.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jansen was in the Blue Jays' lineup at catcher and batting in the second inning on June 26 when the game was suspended. He was traded to the Red Sox last month, and on Monday he took his position behind the plate as pinch-hitter Daulton Varsho struck out to complete the at-bat that Jansen started.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An authenticator was on hand to tag all of Jansen’s equipment, and the Baseball Hall of Fame said it requested the scorecard from official scorer Bob Ellis. Ellis was also working the game when it started in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This scorecard will be a great tool to document and illustrate this history, showing Danny Jansen’s name on both teams,” Hall spokesman John Shestakofsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the ballpark opened to fans, the scoreboards were showing Jansen at bat for the Blue Jays – complete with a picture of him in his Toronto cap. Before the first pitch, the umpires held an extended conversation at home with the coaches who brought out some of the weirdest lineup cards in baseball history. (AP)

    Paris metro 'impossible' for disabled, admits boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Paris metro comprises more than 300 stations, but only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767747_1_20240827012015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Paris regional transport network admitted on Monday that the city's metro system is near-impossible for disabled people to navigate as the French capital prepares to host the Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Games start on Wednesday, with a lack of accessible metro transport for disabled visitors a major gripe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first Paris metro opened in 1900 and the network has grown into the busiest system in the European Union, with more than 300 stations spread over 16 lines carrying over four million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's historic metro lines "remain the weak spot" in terms of accessibility, said Valerie Pecresse, who as president of the Paris region also runs its transport network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called for a massive effort to fix the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While all buses running in central Paris can take wheelchairs, only 25 percent of rail services – metros, trams and the RER suburban mass transit system – were accessible, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the metro could be modernised in terms of accessibility, she told reporters, although it would take 20 years and cost between 15 and 20 billion euros (US$16.7 to 22.3 billion) in investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an effort "could become the great project of this decade", she said, dubbing the idea "A Metro for All."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris's preparations for the Paralympics, which run to September 8, has highlighted the lack of accessible transportation in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Pecresse said some solutions had been put in place for the Games, including around 100 minibuses to take disabled visitors to competition venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There would also be a smartphone app to help them prepare their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities expect up to 300,000 daily visitors during the Paralympics, about half that of the Olympics. (AFP)

    Israel strikes Gaza after Lebanon flare-up

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military struck the Gaza Strip on Monday a day after truce talks in Cairo coincided with a major but brief cross-border escalation involving Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has drawn in Tehran-aligned armed groups across the Middle East, repeatedly heightening fears of a broader regional conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest flare-up between Israel and Hamas-ally Hezbollah, the Lebanese group on Sunday launched rockets and drones in retaliation for a top commander's killing as Israel carried out air raids the military said thwarted a larger attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel swiftly revoked a state of emergency declared early on Sunday, and Hezbollah said its operation was "completed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intense diplomacy has sought to head off a broader retaliation for the late July killings of senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike on Beirut, and of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators held meetings in the Egyptian capital on Sunday but reported no breakthrough in months of protracted negotiations to end the Gaza war as the fighting raged on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key sticking point has been Israel's insistence that it keep control of several strategic areas, including the so-called Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, to stop Hamas from re-arming, something the militant group has refused to countenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cairo, which has been mediating the talks alongside Qatar and the United States, made clear on Monday it would not support continued Israeli control of the corridor, according to state-linked media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt "reiterated to all parties that it will not accept any Israeli presence" along the corridor, Al-Qahera news reported, citing a high-level source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground, witnesses reported air strikes and shelling in Gaza City and other parts of the besieged Palestinian territory overnight and Israel's military said it had struck militants in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medics said an air strike on a Gaza City house killed at least five people, with two rescuers saying more victims may be buried in the ruins in Al-Rimal neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still martyrs and body parts under the rubble," ambulance driver Hussein Muhaysen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli military statement said troops had "eliminated" dozens of militants over the past day in the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, and near Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,435 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not break down civilian and militant deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants in their attack, 105 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces throughout the war, in what the group says is support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After weeks of retaliation threats, Hezbollah early on Sunday launched what it said was part of its response to Shukr's killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking hours after Hezbollah announced its attacks on Israel with hundreds of rockets and drones, the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah said the "main target" was an intelligence base outside Tel Aviv, more than 100 kilometres from the Lebanese border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said there were "no hits" on the Glilot intelligence complex, which according to Israeli media is home to the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli air strikes at the same time hit more than 270 targets in Lebanon, "90 percent" of which were rockets "aimed at northern Israel," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet the strikes were "not the final word" in the campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah appeared to suggest Hezbollah's retaliation for Shukr's killing might be over, saying "if the result is satisfactory" then its response "has been accomplished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Foreign Minister Nasser Kanani praised the Hezbollah attack, saying the "strategic balance has undergone fundamental changes" to the detriment of Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas official said that a delegation from the group met mediators in Egypt's capital on Sunday. Israeli negotiators were also scheduled to go to Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks have been based on a framework laid out in late May by US President Joe Biden and a "bridging proposal" Washington put forth earlier this month with support from Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10 months of war have left large parts of Gaza in ruins, ravaged its healthcare system and sparked a dire humanitarian crisis and warnings of famine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A batch of polio vaccines entered Gaza on Sunday, Israeli authorities said. UN agencies have planned a mass inoculation drive after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successive Israeli evacuation orders have forced many Gazans, most of whom have already been displaced at least once by the war, to move again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Sunday from her hospital bed outside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, Tamam al-Raei said she did not know where to seek safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a war injury. I have broken bones and have had an amputation, and I have been receiving treatment for that," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now they're telling us to evacuate Al-Aqsa. Where do we go? Where do I get treatment?" (AFP)

 Commerce minister Algernon Yau has pledged to make Hong Kong a multinational supply chain management centre to attract more mainland firms to set up shop in the SAR.

  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony on Monday, the secretary for commerce and economic development said his bureau was coordinating with relevant authorities to provide one-stop services for companies to come to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To facilitate the country's accelerated development of new quality productive forces, the SAR government is committed to building Hong Kong into a multinational supply chain management centre, attracting more mainland manufacturers to set up here, managing their offshore trade headquarters, providing comprehensive and complete professional services, and assisting firms to upgrade their supply chain and expanding overseas business," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swedish football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who coached England from 2001 to 2006, died on Monday at the age of 76 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his agent said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "He passed away peacefully this morning with his family around him at his home," Eriksson's agent Bo Gustavsson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swede, who managed a number of high-profile teams and took England to World Cup quarter-finals in 2002 and 2006, announced in February 2023 that he was stepping back from public life due to "health issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, he told public broadcaster Sveriges Radio that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer and that his doctor's assessment was that he had "at best maybe a year (to live), at worst a little less."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have known about this but it happened very quickly. We were not prepared for it to happen today," said Gustavsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born February 5, 1948 in Sunne in western Sweden, Eriksson, who goes by "Svennis" to Swedes, found success as a football manager after retiring from a modest career as a defender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1977, he became manager of Swedish club Degerfors IF. After leading the small club to success in lower divisions, he attracted the attention of bigger clubs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to manage Sweden's IFK Goteborg before finding success internationally, managing Benfica in Portugal, as well as several Italian teams including Roma and Lazio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most high-profile position was as the first foreigner to manage England's national squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his spell, he took England to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002, where they were knocked out by Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also made the last eight four years later where Portugal came out on top in a penalty shoot-out in a game where Wayne Rooney was sent off after a clash with his then Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson led England to the last eight of the 2004 Euros where Portugal again knocked them out in another penalty shoot-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left the England job in 2006 after five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His time in the hotseat had seen a memorable 5-1 win over Germany in a World Cup qualifier but also controversy over his personal life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson then went on to manage Mexico, Ivory Coast and the Philippines, but never his native Sweden's national squad. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Political heavyweights attending a seminar promoting the spirit of the third plenum on Monday said the session highlighted Hong Kong's role in national development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two senior Beijing officials, Shen Chunyao and Wang Wentao, held a seminar on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of China's Communist Party, which wrapped up in Beijing last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plenum adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, told reporters after the seminar that the SAR can contribute in a lot of ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two VIPs do suggest a lot of Hong Kong strengths, and the CE does suggest that we have to incorporate into our daily life. I totally agree with them, and we have to [take] action and we have to use Hong Kong's ability to contribute to the future of our country," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Executive councillor and lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said Hong Kong has to work harder to lure global talent and enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the near future and also in the distant future, we have to attract more companies to come and settle in Hong Kong and also talent to come to Hong Kong to help us progress. Hong Kong can go from strength to strength," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not have to worry too much about the fake news that is demonstrated by the liars everywhere around the world. We have to make sure that we do what is right for the country and for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yuk-shan, deputy director of the Basic Law Committee, said the session clearly spelled out the timeline for deepening reforms and the country's future plans.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Monday highlighted the key roles of Hong Kong and its contribution to the country, while also stressing that China's development offers the strongest support for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China's Communist Party earlier wrapped up the third plenary session of its 20th Central Committee, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a seminar held in Hong Kong on promoting the spirit of the plenum, Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress, said the country must rely on reform and opening up to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through reform and opening up, we have to promote the modernisation with Chinese characteristics... Reform and opening up have been crucial to the course of the party and the people, enabling us to catch up with the times in great strides," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shen, who also chairs the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, pointed to a particular role for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles, given their respective strengths as 'super-connectors'. Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles in telling China's story well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the resolution, Beijing stated its support for Hong Kong's bid in becoming an "international hub for high-end talent" and consolidating its status as an international finance, maritime and trading centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said as a separate customs territory and a free port, the SAR serves as an important bridge for trade and investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also said Hong Kong should expand its talent pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong has long been nurturing talent from different parts of the world, and has a great business environment and a highly internationalised market. The education system and city life are very attractive. These are Hong Kong's strengths in pooling talent from far and wide,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister also said the One Country, Two Systems principle is "the biggest advantage" Hong Kong has.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When it comes to support, our country's development is the biggest support that Hong Kong can get," Wang said. "I personally think that national strength and capacity is the biggest support for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, said the top-level meeting showed the central government's high hopes for the SAR, and that the city should stay determined and find new ways to contribute to the country's reform and opening up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is extensive discussion of reform measures about Hong Kong. This shows the solicitude and high expectations of the central government. This is a strategic fulcrum for Hong Kong to shine. This also means new opportunities for Hong Kong to go from stability to prosperity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, said Hong Kong has played a key role in the country's reform and opening up and the SAR must be more proactive in integrating into the development of the nation.

    5 more arrested for alleged corruption and bid rigging

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ICAC and the Competition Commission conducted a joint operation last week, to crack down on what they say was a syndicate engaging in corruption and bid rigging. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767709_1_20240826181544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five more people were arrested for alleged corruption and bid rigging in an operation that has seen more than 20 people investigated since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alleged mastermind and core syndicate members of the same syndicate were among 20 arrested in the first joint-operation between the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Competition Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two statutory bodies revealed on Monday they carried out a second joint-operation last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the five were suspected of engaging in acts which corrupted the renovation projects of two Hong Kong Island housing estates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The key members of the syndicate allegedly offered advantages to members of the Owners' Corporation through middlemen, so as to ensure the two syndicate-controlled companies would be awarded the contracts worth HK$140 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work on the projects had yet to begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Competition Commission also found the arrestees were allegedly involved in tender-rigging for contracts on 38 residential estates and industrial buildings amounting to over HK$1 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The highest amount involved a contract worth HK$260 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Au, head of investigations of the Competition Commission, said their investigation found that when renovation contracts were opened for tender, staff of the company concerned were alleged to have directly, or through middlemen, exchanged and coordinated the bidding price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the project contractors, meanwhile, carried out cover bidding, such as through using a higher bidding price to cover for others, until they have controlled the bidding results, and helped the designated bidder to win the tender," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers seized several computers, mobile phones, as well as related documents after searching around 20 premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not rule out more arrests.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China has beefed up security along its border with Myanmar where clashes between the ruling military government and rebel forces have escalated.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said its military was carrying out armed patrols near the Myanmar border this week, with Beijing concerned about the potential fallout from a civil war on the other side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Troops were deployed to Yunnan Province on Monday to test their ability to maintain security in border areas, the military’s Southern Theatre Command said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An alliance of ethnic militias has dealt a series of setbacks to Myanmar's military in the country's northeast, which is near China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five people were injured on the Chinese side in January by a stray artillery shell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live-fire drills would be held from Tuesday to Thursday in four locations including two in Ruili city, the Yunnan government said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The units will carry out armed patrols and joint air-ground patrols to test their ability to mobilise quickly, block and control and strike together, the southern command said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military previously held live-fire drills near the Myanmar border in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier this month that China “opposes chaos and war in Myanmar," according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing helped broker a cease-fire in Myanmar back in January, but that fell apart in June when one member of the Three Brotherhood Alliance launched new attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar issued a reminder this month to citizens in Shan State to strengthen their security precautions and stay away from conflict zones or return to China. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistani officials on Monday said at least 23 people were killed in a militant attack on a highway in southwestern Pakistan which targeted vehicles from buses to goods trucks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Armed men blocked the route in the province of Balochistan on Sunday night, took passengers off the vehicles, and shot them after checking their identity cards, a senior superintendent of police, Ayub Achakzai, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The armed men also not only killed passengers but also killed the drivers of trucks carrying coal," said Hameed Zahir, the deputy commissioner of the area where the incident occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 trucks were set on fire after their drivers had been killed, he added.

  Militants fighting a decades-old ethnic insurgency to demand the secession of resource-rich Balochistan from Pakistan have targeted workers from the eastern province of Punjab whom they see as exploiting their resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Balochistan Liberation Army group said its fighters had targeted military personnel travelling in civilian clothes, who were shot after being identified.
  <br/>

  Pakistan's interior ministry said the dead were innocent citizens.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should learn from and embrace the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and integrate it into daily life, Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 500 government officials, Executive Council members and lawmakers on Monday morning attended a seminar held at the government headquarters promoting the spirit of the plenum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks were led by Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress and chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who's also the Secretary of the CPC leadership group of the Ministry of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third plenum, which wrapped up last month in Beijing, adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the seminar, Lee said studying the spirit of the third plenum was beneficial to the SAR's long-term development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand its importance and significance for Hong Kong's future development, seize the opportunities, and further leverage Hong Kong's advantages of being highly internationalised, market-oriented, and rule of law-based under the 'One Country, Two Systems' system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong plays an irreplaceable role in the country's further reform and opening up. As a super connector and super value-adder, Hong Kong continues to play an important role as a bridge and window connecting the mainland and the world in going global and bringing in [enterprises]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about measures to attract high-end talent from around the world, Lee said the SAR government had introduced a series of programmes to bring in graduates from top universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said there were 340,000 applications for the Top Talent Pass Scheme so far, of which 210,000 had been approved.

  <br/>
  Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng announced on Monday that Sam would leave his roles as president and judge of the city's top court, as well as a member of the Independent Commission on the Recommendation of Judges starting Wednesday, as per Sam's request.
  <br/>

    'Revenue not the only consideration for land sales'
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development chief Bernadette Linn says financial proceeds are just one of the factors the government considers when it comes to the pace of land sales, saying market sentiment and the effect on prices of putting a plot up for sale are also important.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amid a sluggish property market, the government has eight plots in its land sale programme in the current financial year. One plot in Sha Tin was put up for sale in the last quarter, and another in the same area in the quarter before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said if a plot goes unsold or the bids received are far lower than market estimates, it can hurt property prices in the relevant district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials therefore need to assess the sentiments of the market and developers when making decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the land sale programme can serve as an adjustment tool and if there is sufficient private land, then the government doesn't need to roll out as much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary noted that in the past three financial years, not all sites in the programme were made available for bidding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also described the economy as being at a turning point right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many people have expectations about the US cutting interest rates later. Will Hong Kong follow? Everyone can see the market sentiments, like in the past half a year, there has been economic growth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But everyone is taking the wait and see approach - whether the growth is sustainable. Investors are taking that approach, and so are developers who bid for land."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also shot down the idea of returning to the system before 2013, when land sales were triggered by developers' applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government needs to have control over land provision and stability, saying the public could get very pessimistic about the market if developers are conservative and don't make applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the current financial year, the government has yet to put up any commercial plots for sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said if office vacancy rates in the upcoming quarters remain similar to current levels, there's a chance the government will continue to defer rolling out plots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said there are currently plenty of commercial buildings under construction, and so supply is not a problem.

    Australia gives workers the right to disconnect

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia gave millions of workers the legal right to "disconnect" on Monday, allowing them to ignore unreasonable out-of-hours contact from employers, to the distress of big industry.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People can now "refuse to monitor, read, or respond to" their employers' attempts to contact them outside work hours -- unless that refusal is deemed "unreasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law is similar to legislation in some European and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unions welcomed the legislation, saying it gave workers a way to reclaim a level of work-life balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a historic day for working people," said Michele O'Neil, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The union movement has won the legal right for Australians to spend quality time with their loved ones without the stress of being forced to constantly answer unreasonable work calls and emails," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australian unions have reclaimed the right to knock off after work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the reforms got a cool welcome from Australian industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'right to disconnect' laws are rushed, poorly thought out and deeply confusing," the Australian Industry Group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the very least, employers and employees will now be uncertain about whether they can take or make a call out of hours to offer an extra shift," said the country's peak industry group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law, enacted in February, came into force for medium-sized and large companies as of Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smaller companies with fewer than 15 employees will be covered from August 26, 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We encourage workplace participants to educate themselves on the right to disconnect and take a common sense approach to applying it within their workplace," said the head of Australia's workplace relations regulator, Fair Work Ombudsman Anna Booth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the law, workers may be ordered by a tribunal to stop unreasonably refusing out-of-hours contact, and employers likewise may be ordered to stop unreasonably requiring employees to respond, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The question of what is reasonable will "depend on the circumstances", the Fair Work Ombudsman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deciding factors may include the reason for the contact, the nature of the employee's role, and their compensation for working extra hours or being available, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France introduced the right to disconnect in 2017, hoping to tackle the "always on" culture facilitated by smartphones and other digital devices. (AFP)

    CUHK unveils novel remote endoscopy surgery

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A surgeon in Zurich has performed the world’s first remote endoscopy procedure on a pig in Hong Kong, as researchers believe it paves the path for better and immediate surgical care in remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure was conducted in May as part of a joint-study between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) which started two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinician in Switzerland controlled a surgical controller that was remotely connected across 9,300 kilometres to an endoscope in the operating theatre in Hong Kong, CUHK said, noting that the endoscope matched every movement the clinician made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design was to use multiple small magnets to build our endoscope and use a magnetic field to control the direction, forward, backward, turn left, turn right, to control the angulation of the endoscope to perform an endoscopy," says Dr Shannon Chan from CUHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the surgeon in Switzerland would use the controller to control the magnetic field in Hong Kong and thus, with that, he could control the endoscope.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chan said the technology could be a game-changer for remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For places where they are lacking in experts, for example, in gastrointestinal disease, then the experts in their hometown can control and perform the endoscope for patients… so the experts can diagnose and treat patients from afar,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are hoping that with this technology... we are able to train doctors in resource-limited areas to perform some procedures remotely instead of having to fly over to their country to teach them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dr Chan noted a key prerequisite would be a stable Wi-Fi network in those areas, saying that would take a few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it's too early to compare the success rate of remote surgery with conventional procedure, saying the research team's next step is to prove the procedure is safe on human patients.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have called on people who want to join the force to enrol in their mentorship programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior inspector Jaffy Chan, overseeing recruitment, said the mentorship initiative would help candidates when applying to join the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said figures showed that one in five programme participants would successfully secure the position of Probationary Inspector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This success rate surpasses that of non-participants, where only one out of every 27 people succeeded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan explained that those who join the mentorship programme would gain hands-on experience and personal coaching from police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The very intentions of the rolling out of the programme is to allow mentees to have a diverse experience in getting to know what the police does, and how it's like to be a police officer should they join in the future," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, for this programme, every mentee is assigned with a mentor who will give them personal experience and coaching and workshop for their preparations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, 228 people joined the police mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them was 24-year-old Luce Lo, who took a two-month hiatus from her full-time job as a financial adviser for the mentorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said she was motivated to join the Police Force after the mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My determination is far more than before I have joined this internship, because through
  <br/>
  the daily interactions with the police inspectors or those colleagues, I see some qualities and also their professionalism being a police [officer]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applications for next year's mentorship programme will open on September 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lydia Ko said she had enjoyed a "Cinderella" story after ending an eight-year wait for a major title by winning the Women's British Open at St. Andrews on Sunday, just a fortnight after her Olympic gold medal triumph in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New Zealander finished in champion style with a superb birdie on the 18th hole of a windswept Old Course to complete a round of three-under-par 69 and claim her third major title with a tournament total of seven under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is surreal," Ko said. "Winning the gold medal in Paris a few weeks ago was almost too good to be true. Heading into the weekend I thought 'how is it possible for me to win the Open?'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko entered the final day three shots back of third-round leader Jiyai Shin, a two-time Women's Open champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shin was one of four women tied for second, with China's Ruoning Yin, Nelly Korda and Lilia Vu – each of them former major winners who have been ranked No. 1 in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is almost too good to be true," she added. "Out of all the major championships, this was the one I had the least amount of confidence in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory gave Ko, 27, her first major since she won the 2016 Chevron Championship. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) says its HA Go app has reduced waiting times at specialist out-patient clinics with the vast majority of patients being able to leave within two hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We want to keep the patients and not make them stay in our specialist clinics for more than two hours, which was not optimum in the past, but now more than 80 percent of them can achieve this target," said Larry Lee, the Hospital Authority's manager of cluster performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launched in 2019, the app's functions include appointment booking and queue monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the HA would continue to expand the app's functions, such as in the areas of telehealth and outreach services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority says the app has been downloaded over 3.3 million times and its user base has grown to more than 2.6 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Adam Yates secured a sensational stage nine victory in the Vuelta a Espana on Sunday to revive his general classification hopes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British UAE Team Emirates rider went solo 58 kilometres from the finish in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He crossed the line one minute 39 seconds ahead of Richard Carapaz, who also put himself back in contention with a superb ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never suffered like this before, it's so hot out there," said Yates. "From the last climb I was cramping and I didn't know if I could go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had a lot of bad luck in Grand Tours over the years and I really didn't know if I could make it," he added. "But I'm just so happy I could finally win another Grand Tour stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor retained the red jersey and increased his lead on second placed Primoz Roglic to three minutes 53 seconds by claiming four bonus seconds as he finished third on the 178.5km run from Motril to Granada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every second counts, and I didn't lose time today – to some guys, yes – but in the end I showed my real capacity and what I can do, so I'm proud." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish champions Real Madrid earned a 3-0 win over Real Valladolid in La Liga on Sunday as Kylian Mbappé made his Santiago Bernabeu bow without finding the net.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atletico Madrid comfortably beat last season's surprise package Girona by the same scoreline later on in the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's French striker Mbappé played at home for the first time in a Los Blancos shirt but was largely frustrated by Valladolid's defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde opened the scoring after 50 minutes and substitutes Brahim Diaz and debutant Endrick struck late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without the injured Jude Bellingham Madrid created little in the first half but did enough after the break to earn their first win of the season, following an opening draw at Real Mallorca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still lacking fluency in attack, Carlo Ancelotti's side stayed two points behind rivals Barcelona, who beat Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé scored on his debut in a UEFA Super Cup triumph but in La Liga, has failed to score in his opening two matches. (AFP)

    UK mobile operator warns about smartphones for kids

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767599_1_20240826081103.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Britain's biggest mobile network operators said on Sunday it will warn parents they should not give smartphones to children under the age of 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents about the potential pitfalls of smartphone access for young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent study by the UK communications regulator found around a quarter of British children aged between five and seven-years-old now had a smartphone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EE will say in new guidance that children should only be given phones with "limited capability devices" allowing them only to text and call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will also advise enabling parental control features for teens under the age of 16 and restrictions on social media for the under-13s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK parents have increasingly started to push back against the trend of giving children one of the devices when they transfer from primary to secondary school at the age of 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widely justified on safety grounds in case of an emergency on the way to or from school, parents fear the phones also potentially open children up to online predators, bullying, social pressure and harmful content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While technology and connectivity have the power to transform lives, we recognise the growing complexity of smartphones can be challenging for parents and caregivers," said Mat Sears, EE corporate affairs director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They need support, which is why we are launching new guidelines on smartphone usage for under 11s, 11 to 13-year-olds, and 13 to 16-year-olds to help them make the best choices for their children through these formative years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US author Jonathan Haidt -- whose recent book "The Anxious Generation" argued that smartphones have rewired children's brains -- has urged parents to act together on smartphone access so it becomes the norm for children not to have one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child "breaks our heart" by telling us they are excluded from their peer group by being the only one without a phone, he said earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haidt advocates for no smart phones before the age of 14 or social media before 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These things are hard to do as one parent. But if we all do it together -- if even half of us do it together -- then it becomes much easier for our kids," he added. (AFP)

    Norris beats Verstappen in Dutch Grand Prix

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris celebrates on the podium after winning the Dutch Grand Prix with third placed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767598_1_20240826011450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris stormed to victory at the Dutch Grand Prix on Sunday, a superb drive consigning home favourite Max Verstappen to his first-ever loss in front of his "Orange Army" fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British driver claimed his second career chequered flag after winning in Miami in May, closing Verstappen's lead over him in the world championship to 70 points, with the Dutchman coming second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite raucous encouragement from a packed Zandvoort circuit, Verstappen could not extract enough from his Red Bull to compete with a recently upgraded McLaren that is beginning to look like the car to beat in Formula One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels amazing... The pace was very strong and the car was unbelievable today," said Norris, who also secured a point for the fastest lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The start was critical. Questions have been asked of the starting ability of Norris, who has three times this season failed to convert pole position into a first lap lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And again Norris was sluggish off the line, allowing Verstappen to power around the outside to huge cheers from the crowd, who saw their man take a 0.9-second advantage into the second lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buoyed by the fast start, Verstappen clocked the quickest lap in lap two, putting clear daylight between him and the McLaren of Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the McLaren had been the fastest car in the paddock all race weekend and Norris started slowly but surely eating into Verstappen's lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 17 out of 72, Norris was only a few tenths of a second behind Verstappen, the Dutchman complaining on his team radio of a lack of grip from his tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris passed him a lap later on the outside at turn one, Verstappen powerless to prevent the overtake and quickly falling further behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't go faster. The car is not responding to my inputs," a desperate Verstappen told his engineers as Norris stretched his advantage to more than four seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On lap 25, Verstappen decided enough was enough and he needed a new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris pitted the lap after, his team taking 0.6 seconds longer than the Red Bull for the pit stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, Norris emerged from the two stops five seconds ahead of his rival and promptly produced the fastest lap of the race on his new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 40, Norris had extended the advantage to more than 10 seconds over the three-time champion and just had to stay out of trouble to take the chequered flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His eventual margin of victory was 22.896 seconds, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc holding off Norris's McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri to claim the third podium spot after a thrilling battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's struggling second driver Sergio Perez finished in sixth position, meaning the gap in the constructors' championship also narrowed from 42 points to 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't say a perfect race because of lap one again, but afterwards it was beautiful," said Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expected Max to start pushing and get a bit of a gap. And he never did. So from that point, I knew we were in with a good fight," added Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But he seemed to just keep dropping off. And my pace was getting better. So it's a nice feeling inside the car. And especially when I got past, you know, I could just get comfortable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The F1 circus now moves on to the famous Monza track in Italy next weekend, round 16 of 24 with everyone snapping at Verstappen's heels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has not won a Grand Prix since Barcelona in June, his longest barren spell since 2020 and while it is premature to talk of panic stations at Red Bull, the Dutch weekend will have given some cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You always try to do better and we had a good start, we tried everything we could today, but throughout the race it was quite clear that we are not quick enough, so I tried to be second today," said Verstappen. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chelsea's Noni Madueke holds the match ball after scoring a hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767597_1_20240826004756.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 at Molineux on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chelsea's first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca's side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer, but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves fell part after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side's sixth goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much has been made of Chelsea's huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea's league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today means a lot. I was really just trying to be clever and wait for the right moment," Madueke said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unbelievable. (Palmer) is cold and I am fire so it mixes well. He has the ability to always play a pass at the right time. I like to get the ball in space, beat people and make things happen, so luckily today it worked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair combined to restore Chelsea's lead in the 49th minute with the 22-year-old Madueke getting lucky as his shot deflected off of Rayan Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That goal sapped the fight out of Wolves and it was Palmer again who sent the over-lapping Madueke clear to slam a shot through the legs of Wolves keeper Jose Sa's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke made it 5-2 with an almost identical goal as Wolves conceded possession and Cole sent him clear to complete his hat-trick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves will wonder what happened after they played some enterprising football in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were caught cold when Jackson headed Chelsea in front after two minutes but deservedly levelled in the 27th minute when Cunha fired home after being set up by Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves pressed for a second but it was Chelsea who went back in front on the stroke of halftime with Palmer producing a delightful lobbed finish from 30 metres with his left foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea were caught out again in first-half stoppage time, however, as Norwegian Strand Larsen opened his Wolves account, stretching out his foot to convert from close range after a free kick was headed across the penalty area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Newcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara's effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal," said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe who was given a warm reception on his return to his old club.
  <br/>
  <br/>

 Hong Kong martial arts actor Jackie Chan was named on Sunday as one of the torchbearers in the lead-up to the opening ceremony of the Paralympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 70-year-old, known for his stunts and acrobatic fight scenes, will carry the flame on Wednesday afternoon in the French capital just hours before the opening ceremony, the organising committee announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French actress Elsa Zylberstein, and dancer/choreographer Benjamin Millepied will also take part in the torch relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As with the Olympic opening ceremony, Wednesday's event will take place beyond the confines of the Stade de France, with a parade down the Champs-Elysees to the Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame, which was was lit on Saturday in Stoke Mandeville in the UK, the historic birthplace of the Paralympic Games, arrived in France via the Channel Tunnel on Sunday, carried by wheelchair fencing medalist Emmanuelle Assmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about inscribing sport in the hearts of people with disabilities," said French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera who was on hand to welcome the flame, alongside Tony Estanguet, head of the organising committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame was due to continue its journey where it would be "multiplied" into 12 Paralympic flames, which will be carried by 1,000 torchbearers in around 50 towns, in 12 simultaneous relays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These 12 relays will converge on Paris, where the flame will arrive on Wednesday for the opening ceremony. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician said on Sunday that teachers and parents should focus on helping children with special educational needs adapt to social settings, given that the pandemic had a profound impact on these children's physical and mental health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Patrick Ip, clinical professor at HKUMed, said his team found in their research with more than 1,000 children in Hong Kong that many with special educational needs lacked interaction and support during the pandemic and this has affected them since returning back to the classroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that additional support at school and at home is needed to help these children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this critical moment when children are returning to school again, we need to pay particular attention to all our children, in particular those with special educational needs, that we should not overemphasise on school examinations and too much pressure on academic performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, we should support them, back up actually to their resuming to the normal learning environment, and encourage them to actually engage in more recreational and also playful environmental activities so that they could get adapted to the new environment, to build up rapport with their peers and also to engage with their teachers and senior professionals much better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip advised parents to focus on their children's psychological well-being, by encouraging more outdoor activities and sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be aware about the needs of individual children. Let the parents to get involved in assessing and also following up of learning of the individual child, so that they could participate in all those support together with the school teachers, continue with some of the continued training and then understand the needs and emotions of the individual child with SEN also at the family setting," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And also to plan for some group activities together with the children and their peers, and try to go out with those little kids with special educational needs to do more recreational outdoor activities in order to soothe their stress and let the children get adapted to the new environment together with their parents."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community activist group on Sunday called on the government to make sure subdivided flat tenants find housing elsewhere if they are evicted because their homes fail to meet minimum living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came after a government task force submitted suggestions on minimum living standards to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, deputy director of the Society for Community Organization Sze Lai-shan said the group welcomes any measures to improve people's quality of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, she warned that people living in subdivided housing might have to relocate if new rules are brought in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, everyone wants to solve this problem. But they think about if they have this kind of standard, so some of them, they will be closed or they need to move out and then they need to modify it or renovate it," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are afraid they will be homeless."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as calling for the government to ensure such residents find new homes, Sze also said the city's public housing supply should be increased to alleviate the housing shortage.
