<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Thursday it will consider issuing a typhoon signal Number Eight between 4pm and 7pm, as super typhoon Yagi edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Number Three strong wind signal has been in force since 6.40pm on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters said according to the present track, Yagi will skirt around 300 kilometres to the southwest of Hong Kong on Thursday night and Friday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Gales associated with Yagi are expected to edge closer to the Pearl River Estuary later today. Local winds will strengthen further and weather will deteriorate," the Observatory said in a Thursday morning udate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Observatory will consider issuing the Gale or Storm Signal, No 8 between 4pm and 7pm today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that outer rainbands associated with Yagi are affecting the coast of Guangdong. Seas are rough with swells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People are adviced to stay away from the shoreline and not engage in water sports, while those engaging in outdoor work or activities should also take note of the changes in weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All inbound and outbound flights from Hainan's Haikou airport would be suspended from Thursday at 8pm until Friday midnight, local authorities said, as they closed beaches and coastal tourist attractions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 13 people were killed in the Philippines earlier this week due to Yagi. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    However, the SAR's athletes didn't fare as well elsewhere.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the piste, veteran wheelchair fencer Alison Yu missed out on a bronze after losing 11-15 to Spain's Judith Rodriguez in the individual foil category A.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Yu had earlier silenced the French crowd by edging home favourite Brianna Vide by one point, 15-14, in the repechage to enter the medal round.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    She found it "regretful" not to have finished on the podium in individual foil.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "That's just how competitive sports go - some win, some lose. Tomorrow is a new day," Yu told RTHK.

    In the pool, swimmer Chan Yui-lam finished fifth in the SB14 200m individual medley, after entering the final with the third-fastest time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    She said she knew the field was strong, and as long as she did her best, it didn't matter whether she won a medal or not.

    Earlier, her teammate Cheung Ho-ying barely missed the cut after finishing ninth in the heats.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kaden Groves won a thrilling sprint finish to take the 17th stage of the Vuelta a España, as Australians dominated a rain-drenched day of racing through northern Spain on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Groves' fellow Australian Ben O'Connor of the Decathlon team held the overall race lead with a five-second advantage on Slovenian three-time champion Primoz Roglic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third Australian Jay Vine of UAE Team Emirates held on to the polka-dot jersey for the best climber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Groves, riding for the Alpecin Deceuninck team, pipped Czech Pavel Bittner of DSM with Belgian Vito Braet of Intermarche-Wanty third after the 142km run from Arnuero to Santander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Groves, it was his third stage win in this year's race and seventh on the Vuelta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Belgian Wout Van Aert out of the race after suffering a painful knee injury on Tuesday, Groves is the favourite for the top sprinters green jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was quite a tough day, starting dry and then the majority of the finish wet," Groves told reporters at the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It made it quite dangerous out there. My team were so strong," he added. "They had a really super day. To repay them with win number three is pretty special." (AFP)

    Four killed in US school shooting in Georgia

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A young girl and her mother watch as law enforcement and first responders surround Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1769183_1_20240905055126.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 14-year-old gunman killed at least four people, including two students, and wounded nine more when he opened fire at a high school in the US state of Georgia on Wednesday, law enforcement said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooter – also a student at the school – was taken into custody. He will be charged with murder and tried as an adult, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two teachers were also among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the latest chapter in America's gun violence crisis – nearly 400 mass shootings this year alone, by one tally – people gathered at a sports field outside Apalachee High School, some forming a circle with their arms linked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, school authorities were reported to have sent a message to parents saying they were enforcing a "hard lockdown after reports of gunfire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our school resource officer engaged him," county sheriff Jud Smith told reporters, referring to law enforcement officers employed to work at US schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The shooter quickly realised that if he did not give up that it would end with an OIS – an officer-involved shooting. He gave up, got on the ground, and the deputy took him into custody."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police did not yet know if the shooter singled out specific people as targets and authorities had not yet identified the weapon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the all-clear was given, parents were invited to the school to be reunited with their children, with long lines of vehicles visible outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One student told local media that he saw blood on the floor and a body as he was led out of the building by authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I heard gunshots go off... I thought it was fake until I heard more gunshots and screaming," said the male student, whose name was not given by the Fox 5 News channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper quoted 11th grade student Henry van der Walt as texting his mother that he thought "there's a school shooting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minutes later, he texted: "I love you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local television footage showed ambulances driving across a school field about two hours after the attack was first reported, with scores of vehicles parked around the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting occurred near the town of Winder, about 70 kilometres northeast of Atlanta, the state capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden said he was mourning the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Students across the country are learning how to duck and cover instead of how to read and write. We cannot continue to accept this as normal," he said, referring to the frequency of such attacks across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  School shootings have become a sadly regular occurrence in the United States, where about a third of adults own a firearm and regulations on purchasing even powerful military-style rifles are lax.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls show a majority of voters favour stricter controls on the use and purchase of firearms, but the powerful gun ownership lobby is opposed to additional restrictions and lawmakers have repeatedly failed to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire after the shooting, Vice President Kamala Harris said it was time to end the "epidemic of gun violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump said the perpetrator of the shooting was a "sick and deranged monster."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, there have been at least 384 mass shootings – defined as a shooting involving at least four victims, dead or wounded – across the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. (AFP)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 11,557 people have been killed in firearms violence this year in the United States, according to the GVA.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell while the Dow edged higher on Wednesday as markets looked ahead to key US employment data amid economic growth concerns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve said employers were "more selective" about hiring, "citing concerns about demand and an uncertain economic outlook," according to the central bank's periodic Beige Book on economic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates this month, and Friday's monthly jobs data could determine by how much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.1 percent at 40,974.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,520, while the Nasdaq shed 0.3 percent to 17,084.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices spent parts of the day in positive territory, an improvement from Tuesday's dreary round. Analysts have noted that September is historically a weaker month for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies United States Steel dropped 17.5 percent following a Washington Post report that President Biden will block a planned US$14.9 billion takeover by Nippon Steel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dollar Tree plunged 22.2 percent after reporting lower than expected earnings, pointing to lacklustre sales that "reflected the increasing effect of macro pressures on the purchasing behavior of Dollar Tree's middle– and higher–income customers," the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nordstrom declined 0.2 percent after disclosing that it received a bid from a consortium that includes some Nordstrom family members and Mexican department store El Puerto de Liverpool to take the company private.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company is naming a special committee to consider the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia dropped 1.7 percent following a Bloomberg News report that it has been subpoenaed by US antitrust regulators as part of a probe into its practices. (AFP)

    Netanyahu says Hamas 'rejected everything' in talks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must control the Philadelphi Corridor. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1769169_1_20240905035433.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Hamas had rejected all elements of a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would help facilitate the release of hostages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Hamas has rejected everything... I hope that changes because I want those hostages out," Netanyahu told a news conference, casting doubt on the possibility of a breakthrough one day after the US State Department said it was "time to finalise that deal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're trying to find some area to begin the negotiations," Netanyahu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They (Hamas) refuse to do that... (They said) there's nothing to talk about."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has come under added domestic and international pressure to seal a deal that would free Israeli hostages after authorities announced on Sunday the deaths of six whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Netanyahu said Israeli forces would retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, vowing "not to give in to pressure" over the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel started the war, is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal from the area as part of the stalled talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Wednesday's news conference, Netanyahu reiterated his position on the Philadelphi Corridor but also insisted it was not the sole sticking point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also unanswered, he said, were questions over how many Palestinian prisoners would be freed in exchange for hostages, whether Israel could veto the release of certain prisoners and where released prisoners should go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The whole thing has not been resolved," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack by Hamas resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,861 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN rights office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At protests in several Israeli cities this week, Netanyahu's critics have blamed him for hostages' deaths, saying he has refused to make necessary concessions for striking a ceasefire deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden said this week he did not think Netanyahu was working hard enough to free the hostages. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women dominated the first day of powerlifting at the Paris Paralympics as Guo Lingling improved her world record in the up to 45kg class on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guo, 35, took her best on the bench press from 121kg in February to 123kg in Paris with Britain's Zoe Newson in second place, 14kg lighter with her leading effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guo's contributions in front of a vocal but half-empty La Chapelle Arena kept her country atop the overall medal table at Paris 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very excited and happy, and the atmosphere at the stadium was also very inspiring to me," Lingling said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese government spends a lot of money training people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So China will always be first on the gold medal tally," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, compatriot Cui Zhe had secured a Paralympic record in the up to 41kg category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui turns 38 in December and finally claimed the gold medal by lifting almost three times her weight in 119kg following four silvers in her previous Games appearances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have always had faith in myself and believed that I could get the gold," Cui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been very determined with this target and never given up, always giving my best performance at competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've felt that I've had a mission that I've never completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To become a Paralympic champion has always been my target and I've always had faith in getting it done," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's Paralympic swimmer Chan Yui-lam finished 5th in the women's 200-metres SM-14 individual medley final in Paris.

    US trade deficit widest in two years on imports surge

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In July, the US goods deficit with China increased by US$4.9 billion to US$27.2 billion, as exports fell and imports picked up. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1769157_1_20240905004241.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US trade deficit in July expanded to its largest since mid-2022, according to government data released on Wednesday, as imports rose more quickly than exports.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overall, the trade gap widened to US$78.8 billion, from a revised US$73.0 billion in June, the Department of Commerce said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The growth was slightly more than analysts expected and the widest since June 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Businesses were likely to be frontloading imports ahead of an increase in tariffs, analysts say, given that Washington earlier unveiled plans to hike levies on Chinese goods ranging from electric vehicles to solar panels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, imports jumped 2.1 percent to US$345.4 billion, boosted by capital goods like computer accessories and industrial supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports, meanwhile, edged up 0.5 percent to US$266.6 billion, the Commerce Department report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual segments, exports of semiconductors rose but auto shipments and that of consumer goods fell as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumer demand has held up in the face of high interest rates, even as the central bank hiked the benchmark lending rate in recent years to counter soaring inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Households have continued spending, dipping into savings, supported by a robust jobs market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A reduction in interest rates, widely expected later this month, could bring the world's biggest economy a further boost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports have had a harder time with global demand weakening and with a strong dollar, analysts earlier noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the US goods deficit with China increased by US$4.9 billion to US$27.2 billion, as exports fell and imports picked up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trade gap with China blew out in July," said economists Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The surge in imports may reflect efforts to get goods into the United States before elections bring more tariffs on their products at the border," the note added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on a quarterly basis, the deficit with China narrowed to US$68.2 billion in the second quarter this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the smallest since the first quarter of 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This report confirms that trade continues to drag down GDP growth at the start of the third quarter," said Weinberg and Farooqi. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Travis Head smashed 80 off 25 balls as Australia chased down Scotland's 154 to win Wednesday's T20 international in Edinburgh inside 10 overs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opener Head blitzed five sixes and 12 fours as Australia set the highest-ever T20 international first powerplay score of 113/1 for the opening six overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourists had lost a wicket without a run on the board as Jake Fraser-McGurk fell to a three-ball duck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Head and captain Mitchell Marsh bludgeoned the Scotland attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marsh smashed 30 off one over from Jack Jarvis, while Head reached his half century from just 17 balls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both fell to Mark Watt in the seventh over but by then the damage had already been done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wicketkeeper Josh Inglis was able to pick up the baton as his quick-fire unbeaten 27 helped earn Australia a seven-wicket victory with 62 balls to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, George Munsey top scored for Scotland with 28.

 Twenty migrants were missing in the Mediterranean after their vessel sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa, a senior official with the UN refugee agency said on Wednesday.

  "Twenty people are reported missing in the Mediterranean after a shipwreck on September 1," Chiara Cardoletti, the UNHCR official for Italy, posted on X.

  "The seven survivors, taken in by our team on Lampedusa, are in a critical condition," she said, adding that several of them had lost loved ones in the disaster.

  The survivors, Syrians, were rescued by the Italian coastguard.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday that Ukraine needed "new energy", as he ordered a major government reshuffle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A total of six ministers, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, submitted their resignation and Parliament accepted the resignations of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included the resignations of a deputy prime minister in charge of European integration, the strategic industries minister overseeing Ukraine's arms production and two other ministers, the lawmakers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need new energy today, and these steps are related only to the strengthening of our state in different directions," Zelensky told media during a joint news conference with a visiting Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers said that Parliament was expected to consider Kuleba's resignation on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Zelensky, 43-year-old Kuleba was the best-known face of Ukraine overseas, meeting leaders around the world and lobbying for military and political support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said the government reset had been planned for some time, but was postponed because Zelensky had focused on talks with Kyiv's Western partners through the summer to secure military and financial aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia said that government changes in Ukraine would not affect a peace negotiation process in any way, although such talks appear a distant prospect with the two warring parties far apart in their objectives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next few months are key for Zelensky as he seeks to win more support from the West and seize back the initiative in Ukraine's fight against Russia. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A damning report on a deadly London high-rise fire in 2017 on Wednesday said decades of failures by government, regulators and industry turned Grenfell Tower into a “death trap” where 72 people lost their lives.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The public inquiry into the blaze, the deadliest fire on British soil since World War II, concluded there was no “single cause” of the tragedy. It said residents were let down by dishonest companies, weak or incompetent regulators and complacent government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We conclude that the fire at Grenfell Tower was the culmination of decades of failure by central government and other bodies in positions of responsibility in the construction industry to look carefully into the danger of incorporating combustible materials into the external walls of high-rise residential buildings and to act on the information available to them,” said the inquiry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added “many failings of a wide range of institutions, entities and individuals” led to the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, marking the end of a long-running two-part inquiry, also accused firms that supplied the cladding and other materials for the residential high-rise of "systematic dishonesty".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inquiry chairperson Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge, delivered the findings from a six-year investigation that examined how building flaws, lax enforcement of safety standards and mistakes by emergency responders contributed to the shocking death toll in the Grenfell Tower blaze. (Agencies)

 The Observatory said it would issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 on Wednesday night, as Yagi intensifies into a severe typhoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the signal will be raised at 6.40pm, as Yagi edges closer to the western part of the south China coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weather forecaster will assess the need to issue higher signals between tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow night depending on the movement and intensity of Yagi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also said there would be swells and that people should stay away from the shoreline and avoid doing water sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Wednesday charged a police chief inspector and his wife on suspicion of accepting more than HK$1.1 million in bribes from a merchant in exchange for preferential treatment and inside information.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ho Siu-tung, 38, faces two counts of public servant accepting an advantage under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance and three counts of misconduct in public office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho and his wife have been released on bail and will appear at the Eastern Magistracy on Friday before the case is transferred to District Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged offence took place between 2021 and 2023, when Ho oversaw investigations of the Wan Chai anti-triad and district crime squads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While handling a deception case, he became acquainted with the merchant who was also linked to a separate assault case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The corruption watchdog said Ho pocketed two cash payments of HK$500,000 each, as well as gifts worth HK$140,000, and agreed to "remain favourably disposed" to the merchant while he performed his official duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer is also accused of divulging internal police information, including the personal data of suspects and other individuals linked to the two cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho's wife, 36, faces one count of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a public servant to accept advantages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said the force had rendered their full assistance during the probe.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of African leaders are in Beijing to attend the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forum officially kicks off on Wednesday with a welcome dinner for the 50 African nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, President Xi Jinping will deliver the keynote speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi has been meeting African leaders attending the summit, among them the presidents of Sierra Leone, Senegal and Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his meeting with Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea, Xi said the summit is committed to drawing up a new blueprint for China-Africa cooperation, and marks a new milestone in the history of China-Africa relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to boosting trade and people-to-people exchanges, African leaders have been meeting Chinese firms to encourage them to set up manufacturing hubs in their countries, to help move their industrial sectors up the value chain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China, Tanzania and Zambia have signed an initial agreement to rehabilitate a decades-old railway aimed at improving the rail-sea transportation in East Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi and his counterparts from the two countries witnessed the signing of the memorandum of understanding on refurbishing the 1,860km Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority railway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to take this summit as an opportunity to make new progress in the revitalisation of the Tanzania-Zambia railway, cooperate to improve the rail-sea intermodal transport network in East Africa, and build Tanzania into a demonstration zone for deepening high-quality China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation," Xi said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific says another 22 flights will be cancelled from September 5-7 as work continues to replace fuel lines on numerous A350 planes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Engineers identified 15 aircraft in need of repairs after a flight to Zurich was forced to return to the SAR due to a glitch on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline said a total of 90 flights have been cancelled this week, but some of the planes affected have already been repaired and all 15 are expected to be back in service by Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Completing thorough inspection and maintenance for all A350 aircraft within such a short timeframe has been challenging. The ability to safely deal with and resolve this issue reflects the can-do spirit of Cathay’s people. I would like to express my sincere thanks to our engineering and frontline teams, along with our partners, for their support and commitment to resolve the situation and minimise flight disruptions," said Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would also like to extend my apology to customers whose travel plans were affected by this incident. At Cathay, the safety of our customers and our people guides every decision we make."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline said the engine component failure identified in its planes is the first of its kind on any A350 anywhere in the world.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LIV golf is returning to Hong Kong in 2025, after the SAR hosted the golf tournament for the first time earlier this year in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tournament at Hong Kong Golf Club will be the third event of the League's 2025 season taking place from March 7 to 9, following two tournaments in Riyadh and Adelaide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Golf Club captain Andy Kwok said in a statement they are looking to build on the success of the inaugural tournament and they are looking to bring back live music and their fan village for food and drinks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We saw record numbers of fans flock to Fanling from the Greater Bay Area and far beyond to watch the biggest names in golf and enjoy the carnival-like atmosphere, so that first event certainly proved there is an enormous appetite for mega sporting events of this scale,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the continued growth of the League and the huge global interest in it, 2025 promises to be even bigger, and the Club, which is one of the oldest golf clubs in Asia, is delighted to play its role in bringing LIV Golf to Hong Kong again for the entertainment of both Hong Kong residents and tourists alike.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok added that some of the sport's biggest stars will be in attendance next year, including Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Cameron Smith and Phil Mickelson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, Abraham Ancer claimed the individual title, while Crushers GC won the team event in the first LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament.

    Court overturns ruling on 'insulting' RTHK show

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1769049_1_20240904115508.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a ruling by the Communications Authority that a satirical RTHK TV programme had breached broadcasting rules by insulting police officers and failing to ensure its content was accurate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Communications Authority had issued a warning to RTHK’s
  <i>
   Headliner
  </i>
  programme over an episode in 2020, which allegedly denigrated police by depicting an officer popping out of a rubbish bin, and for suggesting that the force was scrapping foot patrols amid the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal found that the authority, and a lower court, were wrong in ruling that
  <i>
   Headliner
  </i>
  -- which was taken off air four years ago -- was in breach of broadcast rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I accept that the Police was mocked and lampooned as worthless and unprofessional in the opening and closing sequences of the segment, and that this must be insulting and denigrating to them," wrote the High Court's vice president, Susan Kwan, in the judgment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, it is clear that when the opening and closing sequences are considered in the context of the entire segment, the mockery was directed towards the work of the Police in the fight against Covid-19."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added the authority, and a judge who partially supported their findings, had failed to take into account this broader context, and had misapplied the relevant code in finding that the programme had denigrated the police purely on the basis of social status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Appeals Court also said the lower court had made a “fundamental error” by failing to address the broadcaster’s contention that the comments in the programme regarding the police patrols were a satirical expression about public concerns, rather than a statement of fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, the court ordered the relevant rulings to be quashed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separate appeals over the earlier rulings were lodged by the authority, the RTHK Programme Staff Union and the Journalists Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the verdict, the Office of the Communications Authority said it was studying the ruling with its legal advisers before deciding the next step.

    Scores of imported workers being exploited: union

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A union on Wednesday urged the government to enhance monitoring of construction companies, saying it has received complaints about exploitation of imported workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the Construction Industry Employees General Union said it believes that more than 100 such workers are being exploited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said some have been told to work extra shifts for no pay, and to pay for training fees and the tools they use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union alleged that a company involved in the airport's third runway project told workers to hand over their ATM cards and confiscated more than half of their salaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union's rights and complaints officer, Ng Wai-leung, said the complaints are only the tip of the iceberg and it's likely that many abused workers are keeping silent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They don't want to be blacklisted by their company, making them not able to come to Hong Kong again. This is their main concern," Ng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that some workers have been sacked and sent out of Hong Kong after seeking help from the union.

 The Hang Seng Index fell 176.75 points, or 1 percent, to open at 17,474.74 points on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off follows a poor performance overnight on Wall Street, where the main indices dropped between 1.5 and 3.3 percent.

  AI chip giant Nvidia saw its shares fall by almost 10 percent.

  The US stock market losses come ahead of major employment data later in the week that will have a say in upcoming US monetary policy decisions. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Wednesday it would consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 between 6pm and 9pm as Typhoon Yagi continues to intensify and edge closer to the western part of the South China coast.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Standby Signal No. 1 is now in force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also said it would assess the need to issue higher signals between Thursday afternoon and Thursday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of 9am, Yagi was estimated to be about 520 kilometres southeast of Hong Kong and local winds are expected to strengthen gradually on Wednesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also recorded more than 9,000 lightning strikes from 10pm to midnight on Tuesday amid an Amber Rainstorm Warning signal.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hard-hitting Aryna Sabalenka reached her fourth straight US Open semi-final on Tuesday as she rolled past China's seventh-seeded Zheng Qinwen 6-1, 6-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rematch of this year's Australian Open final, where Sabalenka also triumphed in straight sets, never lived up to its hype.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belarusian world number two used the same playbook at Arthur Ashe Stadium, where she dominated Zheng with her trademark mighty forehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka converted four of eight chances to break Zheng's serve while saving the only break point she faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also finished with 16 winners to Zheng's nine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh off winning the Olympic title, Zheng appeared drained and was missing one of the best weapons in her arsenal as she only made 44 percent of her first serves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Runner-up to Coco Gauff in New York last year, Sabalenka next takes on another American, Emma Navarro, for a place in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She knew she will not be the crowd favorite in the upcoming match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Drinks on me tonight?" she told the crowd in her post-match interview, with a grin on her face. "Drinks on me, and please give me some support in the next match." (Reuters)

 Police have arrested 217 men and 45 women in a seven-week-long anti-narcotics operation. The suspects, aged 15 to 72, were detained on suspicion of manufacturing, trafficking, and dealing in dangerous drugs, as well as possession.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the operation, codenamed Tailbacker, officers seized 695 kilos of suspected cocaine and 572 kilos of suspected marijuana with a total street value of HK$759 million. Police said most of the drugs were recovered from Kowloon East and Yuen Long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those arrested, 33 were aged 20 or below. More than half of them were arrested for trafficking in dangerous drugs. Police said one of the suspects, a 15-year-old boy, was found with 34 grams of suspected crack cocaine and 8.6 grams of suspected ketamine.

  Wheelchair fencers kicked off their campaign in the French capital, but had relatively brief stints on the piste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six-time Paralympian Alison Yu earned a bye in the round of 32 as the 10th seed of the women's sabre category A.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The classification is for fencers with good sitting balance and impairments affecting their lower limbs.

   The 40-year-old made a winning start in the last 16, but was beaten 4-15 by Georgia's Nino Tibilashvili in the quarter-final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yu fell into the repechages, where she was eliminated by Gemma Collis of Great Britain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She admitted sabre wasn't her strong suit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My goal before the event was simply to win one match. I’ve achieved it by winning the first match," the seven-time gold medallist said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Later on, my swordsmanship was a bit lacking compared to other players. What's good about the day was that I could adapt to the venue and the cheers of the audience. I also saw many friends from Hong Kong in the crowd showing their support."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fan Pui-shan was also sent packing from the women's sabre, after being edged out by South Korea's Kwon Hyo-kyeong in the round of 32.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 49-year-old fencer lost 8-15 in category A.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For me, I treated the sabre competition as a warm-up match, because sabre fencing isn't my strong suit. I mainly enjoyed it and got the feel of things," she said.

    In category B for fencers with an impairment that impacts their sitting balance or fencing arm, Tong Nga-ting was unable to advance after she was beaten by her South Korean rival in the repechage.

    The SAR fencers now look ahead to the foil competitions.

     Natasha Tse was placed 15th out of 22 entrants in the grade one individual championship test.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Only the top eight riders progressed to the individual freestyle event.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Tse competed with her new horse, Juno's Whispering Angel.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The four-time Paralympian said she's still figuring out how to team up well with her new equine partner.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "We've worked together about a dozen times over the past few months. We're still getting the hang of things. Its performance is okay, but there's plenty of room for improvement. When I was preparing for the Paralympics, I hurt my waist, but I pushed through to finish the competition," Tse said.

 Taylor Fritz won a big-hitting battle with Alexander Zverev to reach his first Grand Slam semi-final at the US Open on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 12th-seeded Fritz came through against the fourth-seeded 2020 runner-up 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) and will face either American compatriot Frances Tiafoe or Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria for a place in Sunday's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have had a few looks at Grand Slam quarter-finals over the years so I felt it was my turn to take a step further," said the 26-year-old Fritz who cracked 12 aces amongst his 45 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've always had a big serve but at the top of the game it comes back a lot more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev's defeat means world number one Jannik Sinner is the only top-four player left in the draw following the shock early exits of Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Wednesday morning said it may consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later in the day. It had issued the Standby Signal No 1 at 5.40pm on Tuesday, as Severe Tropical Cyclone Yagi neared the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HKO added that the No 1 signal will remain in force until at least noon on Wednesday, with Yagi maintaining a distance of more than 400 kilometres from the SAR on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKO said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later on Wednesday as the storm edges closer to the coast of southern China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the influence of Yagi, the weather over the coast of Guangdong will deteriorate in the latter part of this week. There will be heavy squally showers and seas will be rough with swells," the Observatory said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to take note of the latest weather forecast.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq has slumped more than three percent as Nvidia and other semiconductor equities retreated ahead of key jobs data later in the week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq finished at 17,136, down 3.3 percent in the market's first session in September following Monday's holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 1.5 percent to 40,936, while the S&P 500 shed 2.1 percent to 5,528.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks spent the entire session in the red, giving back a portion of the gains over the last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there's just profit taking, kind of rebalancing going on there," said Sam Burns, chief strategist of Mill Street Research. "And now that earnings season is over, there's much less in terms of corporate news to drive things."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index was 47.2 percent in August, up slightly from a month earlier, but still well below the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ISM officials said demand remained subdued, leading to a fifth straight month of contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stock market losses come ahead of major employment data later in the week that will have a say in upcoming US monetary policy decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prior jobs report sparked a brief but dramatic sell-off in US equities, elevating recession fears before subsequent economic reports bolstered confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another weak jobs report would be a "significant headwind," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Then you have two in a row and you start to be concerned about the future of the economy and jobs," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductor shares Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel all fell about eight percent or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing was another big loser, shedding 7.3 percent following a downgrade by Wells Fargo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While most Dow companies fell, Coca-Cola, Visa and Procter & Gamble were among the equities that defied the trend. (AFP)

    Oilers extend Leon Draisaitl's contract for US$112mn

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768996_1_20240904042110.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Edmonton Oilers have signed Leon Draisaitl to an eight-year contract extension worth US$112 million, a deal that gives the German star the highest salary cap hit in NHL history at US$14 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new contract begins with the 2025-26 season and runs through 2033. General manager Stan Bowman announced the extension on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a historic day for the Edmonton Oilers," Bowman said. "Leon’s commitment to our team, our city and Oilers fans everywhere cannot be overstated. His desire to help bring a Stanley Cup title home to Edmonton is central to everything he does both on and off the ice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Draisaitl and Connor McDavid helped the team reach Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final this past year. Draisaitl, the league’s MVP in 2020, was set to be an unrestricted free agent next summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Getting Draisaitl signed was the biggest task of the Oilers' offseason. Bowman was hired as GM in late July, weeks after being reinstated by the league office following a ban for his role in the Chicago Blackhawks 2010 sexual assault allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Draisaitl surpasses Auston Matthews' US$13.25 million cap hit with this new contract, which nearly doubles his salary. The 28-year-old Draisaitl is making US$8.5 million on average on his current contract, which was signed in 2017 and became one of the most team friendly in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big forward from Cologne has been worth every penny, putting up 850 points in 719 regular-season games since making his NHL debut and being one of the top producers in playoff history with 108 in 74. Draisaitl's 1.46 points a game rank fourth all time among players with 40-plus games in the postseason behind Hall of Famers Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and McDavid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With this contract done, the Oilers can turn their attention to re-signing McDavid, their captain, face of the franchise and reigning playoff MVP. He could be a free agent in the summer of 2026 and is eligible to sign a contract extension July 1. (AP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768994_2_20240904152911.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 51 people were killed and hundreds wounded on Tuesday in a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Poltava, authorities said, in one of the single deadliest strikes of the two-and-a-half-year war.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv said the strike hit a military training facility and a nearby hospital, though authorities did not say how many of the victims were military or civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to hold those to blame accountable, while rescuers worked to clear the rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information available now, this Russian strike killed 51 people," Zelensky said in his evening address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of injured is 271. We know that there are people under the rubble of the destroyed building. Everything is being done to save as many lives as possible," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berlin, London and Washington all condemned the strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the attack was "another horrific reminder of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's brutality," adding that the United States would send more military aid to Kyiv in the coming weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British Foreign Secretary David Lammy called it a "sickening act of aggression," while German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Putin's brutality "knows no limits."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strike triggered anger on Ukrainian social media after unconfirmed reports said it had targeted an outdoor military ceremony, with many blaming reckless behaviour from officials who allowed the event to take place despite the threat of Russian attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky said he had ordered a "full and prompt investigation into all the circumstances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two Russian ballistic missiles hit the hospital and educational institution, partially destroying one of the buildings, Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strike took place in the morning in Poltava, a city with a pre-war population of around 300,000 people, some 300 kilometres east of Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The window blew open. Dust was everywhere. I just had time to tell my sister that a rocket was flying," said Yevgeniya Chyrva, a resident in a building damaged during the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry said that the time between the alarm and the arrival of the missiles was "so short that it caught people in the middle of evacuating to the bomb shelter."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Poltava military communications institute, founded in the 1960s when Ukraine was part of the USSR, specialises in training telecommunications specialists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the institute's buildings was partially destroyed, and many people were trapped under the rubble," the defence ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers were still at work after managing to save 25 people, including 11 trapped under the rubble, the defence ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official channels and local media shared messages urging locals to donate blood to help treat the wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time criticism of Ukrainian officials swirled online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Poltava... How can such a large number of people gather at such a facility?" said one blogger, Sergey Naumovich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been some reports from Russian military bloggers that the strike targeted an outdoor ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poltava's governor, Philip Pronin, said his administration could not provide more details of the circumstances of the strike "for security reasons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enemy is using any means to bring Ukraine more pain and disorientate Ukrainians. Please trust only reliable sources," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian MP Maria Bezugla, who regularly criticises the country's military leadership, accused high-ranking officials of endangering soldiers by allowing such events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These tragedies keep repeating themselves. When will it stop?" she posted on Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack follows another recent scandal for Ukraine's army command after a US-made F-16 fighter jet crashed in combat last week, killing the pilot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash of the F-16 was a high-profile setback for Kyiv, which had lobbied the West to send the advanced fighter jet for months, and triggered the dismissal of the country's air force chief, Mykola Oleshchuk. (AFP)

    Twelve migrants die trying to cross Channel to UK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some of the dead are lined up waiting to be taken away by medical staff. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768985_1_20240904001358.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 12 migrants died off the northern French coast on Tuesday trying to cross the Channel to England in the deadliest such disaster this year, the French government said, as a major rescue operation was underway.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Announcing the death toll on X, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin also said that two migrants were still missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several were injured after their boat carrying dozens ran into trouble off Wimereux, a town some five kilometres from Boulogne-sur-Mer on the French coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darmanin said he was travelling to the area of the disaster to meet officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All government services are mobilised to find the missing people and treat the injured," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency services were out in force and supplying urgent medical assistance, French maritime authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source close to the investigation said the dead included three minors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crew on a French government-operated ship, the Minck, were the first to become aware of the emergency and to respond.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French navy helicopters, fishing boats and military vessels are being mobilised for the operation, which is still ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the deadliest such disaster this year, which has already seen 25 people die in migrant crossings, up from the 2023 death toll of 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths on Tuesday "horrifying and deeply tragic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She criticised the "gangs behind this appalling and callous trade in human lives", adding they "do not care about anything but the profits they make."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron had earlier this summer pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on Monday alone, 351 migrants crossed in small boats, with 21,615 making the journey this year, according to UK government statistics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has cancelled a plan by Britain's former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British government is now planning "a major surge" in returns of irregular migrants to countries including Iraq, an official said on Thursday, as it tries to clear an asylum backlog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to break the business models of the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Steve Smith, head of the Care4Calais charity, said investment in security measures was "not reducing crossings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is simply pushing people to take ever increasing risks to do so," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's time politicians were held accountable for their choice to dehumanise people seeking sanctuary from horrors back home," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's time they ended these tragedies and introduced safe routes." (AFP)

    US manufacturing slump extends into August

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The contraction in US manufacturing activity continued into a fifth consecutive month in August, as demand remained weak, according to industry survey data published on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The data will likely reinforce calls for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates later this month in order to lower borrowing costs and stimulate demand in the world's largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index was 47.2 percent in August, up 0.4 percentage points from a month earlier, but still well below the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was slightly below market expectations, according to Briefing.com.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While still in contraction territory, US manufacturing activity contracted slower compared to last month," ISM survey chief Timothy Fiore said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Demand continues to be weak, output declined, and inputs stayed accommodative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiore said demand was subdued, "as companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current federal monetary policy and election uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The August data point to ongoing challenges in the US manufacturing sector, which has now been in contraction territory for 21 out of the past 22 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists at High Frequency Economics said the figure was not "substantially worse than expected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One survey respondent in the chemical products sector said they had seen a "noticeable slowdown in business activity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Previous optimism about future growth has been dashed," they added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another respondent in the computer and electronic products sector said their business outlook was "good" amid an ongoing recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiore said production execution had fallen from a month earlier, "putting additional pressure on profitability."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Suppliers continue to have capacity, with lead times improving and shortages not as severe," he added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A task force set up to look into a spat between top University of Hong Kong (HKU) officials has expressed hope that it could help the tertiary institution's operations return to normal, following a meeting with its governing council.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Investigation and Study Group on the Internal Operational Affairs of HKU said it's come up with a range of recommendations on the personnel arrangements for senior positions at the university, based on a number of guiding principles such as making the interest of the institution as the overriding priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also called on the university's higher-ups to cooperate and fill senior-level vacancies as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group held a meeting with council members including former lawmaker Abraham Shek and incumbent legislator Chan Chun-ying, where all recommendations put forward by the task force were accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This outcome is the result of more than two months of relentless efforts by the [investigation and study group], which can help the HKU resume normal operations as soon as possible in its fundamental interest," a statement released on Tuesday read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The task force – made up of Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li and University Grants Committee chief Tim Lui – also noted that the university had been conducting hiring exercises, with some relating to senior positions such as the provost, vice-presidents, the registrar and deans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [investigation and study group] urges the council and the management to work expeditiously on these searches with a view to filling such vacancies," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group was established in June this year amid an escalating conflict among the university's leadership. It said it’s held more than 60 meetings with parties, including the university's president and vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang, and council chairwoman Priscilla Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang had previously complained that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Wong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Association for the Physically Disabled of Hong Kong, China said on Tuesday that more promotion of para sports is needed to attract a new generation of para athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association’s chairman, John Leung, applauded the SAR delegation for their speculator performance in the Paris Paralympics. Team Hong Kong has won six medals so far, including two golds, three silvers and a bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong has produced many top-ranking para athletes, and he hopes more will continue to join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of our disabled students and the disabled youth are decreasing. And therefore, we have to work harder to attract more students from the special school, from the disabled school, to encourage them to participate more in the disabled sports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We are] hoping [they will move up]… to the Tier B level, and eventually, they go to the elite."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also said he hopes more resources can be allocated in this area, and that more people in Hong Kong will support and pay attention to para sports in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) on Tuesday issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 5.40pm, as Severe Tropical Cyclone Yagi neared the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HKO added that the No. 1 signal will remain in force until at least noon on Wednesday, with Yagi maintaining a distance of more than 400 kilometres from the SAR on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKO also said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 later on Wednesday as the storm edges closer to the coast of southern China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the influence of Yagi, the weather over the coast of Guangdong will deteriorate in the latter part of this week. There will be heavy squally showers and seas will be rough with swells," the Observatory said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to take note of the latest weather forecast.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A transformed museum documenting China's resistance against the Japanese invasion is set to open on Wednesday, with Chief Executive John Lee calling it "an important base" for patriotic education.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence was renamed the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence, focusing on the history of the War of Resistance and the city's military affairs, to cultivate a stronger sense of national esteem and patriotism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The name change was made on Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the museum now combines the existing relics of coastal defence with exhibitions on the war, to allow visitors to experience "the resolute resistance" of the Chinese people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The history of the war against Japan reminded us to cherish the hard-fought peace. It is an important teaching material for young people to learn the deeds of the martyrs, and deepen their feeling for the nation and traditional cultural connotations," Lee said at an unveiling ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence will become one of the important bases for patriotic education."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revamped museum will see its first thematic exhibition, jointly presented by local and mainland authorities, highlighting the resistance activities of the East River Column in Shenzhen and Hong Kong during the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The museum's curator, Rebecca Cheung, said the exhibition is very important to "convey the idea of patriotism" and to understand the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The East River Column was not only a pillar of the resistance of southern China, but also made a significant contribution to the national victory in the war," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said people are encouraged to donate items and photos relating to the war to the museum for future exhibitions and research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be four exhibition galleries to showcase the history of the War of Resistance at the museum in Shau Kei Wan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will launch an anti-discrimination investigation into Canada's tariff hikes on electric vehicles (EVs) as well as steel and aluminium products imported from China, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing will also launch anti-dumping investigations into rapeseed imports and certain Canadian chemical products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry said Ottawa adopted "discriminatory unilateral restrictive measures" targeting Chinese imports, and China will file an appeal to the World Trade Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada announced last week that it will implement a 100 percent surtax on all Chinese-made EVs, effective October 1, and impose a 25 percent surtax on imports of steel and aluminium products from China from October 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It followed moves by the United States and the European Union to slap tariffs on Chinese EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has criticised the imposition of levies on EVs, calling them unfair and protectionist. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Cathay's handling of engine glitch 'professional'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768907_1_20240903153255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A flight engineering expert said on Tuesday the public should not worry about aircraft safety, after Cathay Pacific grounded its A350 flights due to an engine glitch on Monday which forced its Zurich-bound aircraft to fly back to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The carrier said on Tuesday that ongoing maintenance work had identified 15 airplanes whose engine components had problems which require replacements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the affected planes were expected to be able to fly again on Saturday. Cathay has 48 A350 aircraft in its fleet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warren Chim, the deputy chair of the Institute of Engineers' aircraft division, told RTHK he doesn't think passengers have to worry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the case required a "mandatory occurrence report", meaning it could lead to hazardous or potentially hazardous conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the engineer thinks Cathay's handling of the matter was professional.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As what we observed, everything after the incident happened in accordance with the established process and established procedures," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So as a passenger, I don't think we need to over-worry about that because all the processes and procedures are according to the international practice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chim stressed not only does Cathay need to report the case to local and European authorities, all engine parts will have to go through stringent tests before the planes can fly again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike Ng, an engineering lecturer with the Institute of Vocational Education, said there were around 600 A350 planes in operation around the world, and whether other airlines would be affected could depend on whether those engine parts came from the same batch as Cathay's faulty components.

    Patriotic education group rolls out a theme song

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's Working Group on Patriotic Education came out with a theme song on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Titled "Our Home", the song was sung by sub-group member Cally Kwong - a Cantopop singer who was active during the 1980s. She is also a local deputy to the National People's Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The city has been through a lot in the past years and I have always wanted to produce a song that could bring warmth to the people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong also shared her favourite verses by singing it out loud when meeting the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Convenor Starry Lee revealed that it took them around a year to work on the project after deciding to roll out a song for promoting patriotism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that using [music] is one of the most effective means to [generate enthusiasm] because we all know that, especially children, teenagers, they all love songs. Actually not only students, teenagers, different ages of people, different sectors of people, go to karaoke, or when attending functions, they will choose songs to express their feelings," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope this song will become very popular among different ages, different people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who's also the SAR's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said production costs were low, adding Kwong does not claim any copyright to the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pointed out that a USB-drive will be distributed to primary and secondary schools, so that they can sing the song during lesson time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also rolled out a karaoke version and has made a QR code available for the public to download it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee called on everyone to sing the song before and after National Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added many activities will be rolled out for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and details will be announced later.

 Cathay Pacific says inspections carried out following the inflight failure of an engine component on one of its A350s have found 15 aircraft in need of repairs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's flag carrier has cancelled dozens of flights since a glitch forced the return of a plane bound for Zurich on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maintenance activity on our A350 fleet is progressing well. Our engineering team have thoroughly inspected our fleet of operational A350 aircraft within 24 hours," Cathay said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In total, we have identified 15 aircraft with affected engine components that require replacement and three have already gone through successful repairs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The remaining 12 aircraft in need of replacement parts were expected to resume operations by Saturday, the airline said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it expected to cancel another 20 regional flights on Wednesday, but that no long-haul services would be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the remaining cancellations up to Saturday (7 September), we will provide further details by 2:00pm tomorrow [Wednesday]," the airline said.

    Putin visits Mongolia despite global arrest warrant

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Mongolia on Tuesday with no sign the host country would bow to calls to arrest him on an international warrant for alleged war crimes stemming from the conflict in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trip is Putin’s first to a member country of the International Criminal Court (ICC) since it issued a warrant for his arrest about 18 months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of his visit, Ukraine called on Mongolia to hand Putin over to the court in The Hague, and the European Union expressed concern that Mongolia might not execute the warrant. A spokesperson for Putin said last week that the Kremlin was not worried.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit puts Mongolia in a tough spot. Members of the international court are bound to detain suspects if an arrest warrant has been issued, but Mongolia is a landlocked country highly dependent on Russia for fuel and some of its electricity. The court doesn't have a mechanism to enforce its warrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian leader was welcomed in a ceremony at the capital city's main square by an honour guard dressed in vivid red and blue uniforms styled on those of the personal guard of 13th century ruler Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and Mongolian President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh walked up the red-carpeted steps of the Government Palace and bowed before a statue of Genghis Khan before entering the government building for their meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICC has accused Putin of being responsible for the abductions of children from Ukraine, where the fighting has raged for 2.5 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the European Union expressed concern the ICC warrant might not be carried out and said it shared its concern with the Mongolian authorities. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has launched a programme to make it easier for non-local professionals who have come to Hong Kong through talent schemes to join volunteer services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the launch ceremony on Tuesday, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the initiative aims to help new arrivals integrate into the local community and allow them to contribute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the platform in place, we expect more of the talents to join us, join hands with Hong Kong local people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So together, we believe they can contribute to our society as volunteers, and we also can benefit from their expertise and also their passion towards Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, Sun confirmed that he has received a proposed list of members for a disciplinary panel under the Social Workers Registration Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The confirmation came after local reports said social worker Jackie Chen, who is involved in a rioting court case, had been removed from the list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I, as the Secretary, am satisfied with the list, we're going to publish it in the Gazette. I can confirm we have received the recommended list from the board. So after vetting the list, we're going to publish the list in the Gazette as part of the legal requirement," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the Legislative Council passed a bill to reform the board, raising the number of government-appointed members.

 Pope Francis arrived in Muslim-majority Indonesia on Tuesday to kick off a four-nation tour of the Asia-Pacific that will be the longest and farthest of the 87-year-old's papacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The head of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics touched down in Jakarta for a three-day visit devoted to inter-religious ties, and will then travel to Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12-day tour will test the pontiff's increasingly fragile health, but he is often energised by being among his flock and in recent weeks has appeared in good spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pope was due to have a relaxing day in Jakarta on Tuesday following the long flight from Rome, then meet President Joko Widodo on Wednesday in the first major set piece of his visit to the world's most populous Muslim-majority country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catholics currently represent fewer than three percent of the population of Indonesia -- about eight million people, compared with the 87 percent, or 242 million, who are Muslim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they are one of six officially recognised religions or denominations in the secular nation, including Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Francis will meet representatives of all six at Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia and a symbol of religious co-existence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is linked via a "tunnel of friendship" to the cathedral across the road, where Christians in recent days have been taking selfies with a life-sized cutout of the pope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will then host a mass and deliver a sermon at Indonesia's 80,000-seater national football stadium. (AFP)

    Brazil's supreme court panel upholds X ban

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brazil's Supreme Court ratified the decision by one of its judges to suspend Elon Musk's X social network for alleged judicial transgressions. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768883_1_20240903130013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian Supreme Court panel on Monday unanimously upheld the decision of one of its justices to block billionaire Elon Musk’s social media platform X nationwide, according to the court’s website.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The broader support among justices undermines the effort by Musk and his supporters to cast Justice Alexandre de Moraes as an authoritarian renegade who is intent on censoring political speech in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel that voted in a virtual session comprised five of the full bench’s 11 justices, including de Moraes, who last Friday ordered the platform blocked for refusing to name a local legal representative, as required by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will stay suspended until it complies with his orders and pays outstanding fines that as of last week exceeded US$3 million, according to his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The platform has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to block users, and has alleged that de Moraes wants an in-country legal representative so that Brazilian authorities can exert leverage over the company by having someone to arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Moraes also set a daily fine of 50,000 reais (US$8,900) for people or companies using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some legal experts questioned the grounds for that decision and how it would be enforced, including Brazil’s bar association, which said it would request the Supreme Court review that provision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, with tens of millions of users. Its block marked a dramatic escalation in a monthslong feud between Musk and de Moraes over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the weekend, many X users in Brazil said they felt disconnected from the world and began migrating en masse to alternative platforms, like Bluesky and Threads. (AP)

    UK suspends some arms exports to Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy makes a statement to Parliament on UK arms sales to Israel. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768871_1_20240903120720.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government on Monday said it was suspending exports of some weapons to Israel because they could be used to break international law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK government had concluded there is a “clear risk” some items could be used to “commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told lawmakers the decision related to about 30 of 350 existing export licences for equipment “that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza," including parts for military planes, helicopters and drones, along with items used for ground targeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision wasn't “a determination of innocence or guilt” about whether Israel had broken international law, and wasn't an arms embargo, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on X: “Deeply disheartened to learn of the sanctions placed by the UK Government on export licences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Kingdom is among a number of Israel’s long-standing allies whose governments are under growing pressure to halt weapons exports because of the toll of the nearly 11-month-old conflict in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians in its toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war broke out on October 7 after Hamas militants and others stormed into Israel and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roughly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Tuesday said it would issue the Standby Signal No. 1 this evening and there was a relatively high chance it would issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Forecasters said the number one signal was scheduled to be issued sometime between 5pm and 8pm on Tuesday, as Tropical Cyclone Yagi was expected to remain more than 600 kilometres away from Hong Kong and wasn't expected to directly affect the SAR yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With Yagi edging closer to the coast of southern China gradually, winds will strengthen over the region later this week. The chance for issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 is relatively high," the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it expected heavy squally showers and rough seas with swells, as the weather for coastal Guangdong was expected to worsen in the latter part of the week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Uruguay icon Luis Suarez announced his retirement from international football on Monday, confirming that the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Paraguay will be his last international match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Friday will be my last match for my country," an emotional Suarez, 37, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was not an easy decision to make, but I do it with the peace of mind that I will give my maximum until the very last game of my Uruguay career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Barcelona and Liverpool striker is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and will retire from international football as Uruguay's top scorer with 69 goals from 142 appearances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suarez, who was infamously kicked out of the 2014 World Cup after being handed a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, made his debut for Uruguay in 2007.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Inter Miami forward helped Uruguay capture the 2011 Copa America, where he was named player of the tournament, and would eventually represent the South American country in nine major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suarez said Monday that inspiring Uruguay to that Copa crown had been the highpoint of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't trade the Copa America title for anything," he said. "It was the best moment of my career. I wouldn't trade it for anything." (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's consumer inflation slowed in August to the weakest in nearly 3-1/2 years, official data showed on Tuesday, supporting market expectations for an easing of monetary policy as early as next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index rose 2.0 percent from a year earlier, after gaining 2.6 percent the previous month, marking the slowest annual rise since March 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It matched the median 2.0 percent increase tipped in a Reuters survey of economists and the central bank's medium-term inflation target of 2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, unless there is any additional shock from weather conditions or global oil prices, consumer inflation is expected to stabilise in the lower 2 percent range," said Vice Finance Minister Kim Beom-seok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the Bank of Korea held interest rates steady at their highest in nearly 16 years but revived expectations for a policy easing that some economists see happening as soon as October as growth concerns overshadow inflation worries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank said Tuesday's data showed inflation was stabilising more quickly than in other major economies, and expects prices to maintain a stable trend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, the index was up 0.4 percent, the fastest in six months, after rising 0.3 percent in the prior month and beating forecast by economists for 0.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy items, rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier, slowing from the previous month's 2.2 percent rise and marking the weakest since November 2021. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday appealed for witnesses after a vehicle fell into the sea from Shenzhen Bay Bridge on Monday night; killing the driver, a 46-year-old customs officer. The incident happened at 9.18 pm on the bridge's northbound section.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, police said the car had reportedly gone out of control, rammed into an information road sign on the hard shoulder, then bounced over the barriers before plunging into the sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police officers and firemen sped to the scene and conducted search and rescue operation in the vicinity. The car was located at the bottom of the sea. The driver was trapped inside the compartment and later rescued by firemen. Sustaining multiple injuries, the man was rushed to Tin Shui Wai Hospital in an unconscious state and was certified dead at 1.30 am today," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer had been heading to work at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At an earlier press briefing, chief inspector Chui Wing-luen said the road was dry and there was no road maintenance work at the scene.

   Four-time Paralympian John Loung kicked off a medal spree for the SAR at the men's boccia individual BC1 final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old took a commanding lead after three ends against South Korea's Jung Sungjoon, and held on for a 4-1 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coach Marco Lau revealed Loung didn't think it was possible to reach the final, let alone win a gold medal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Thank you to our head coach, Kwok Hart-wing, and other coaches who have helped him a lot," Lau said after the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, a thank you to Leung Yuk-wing for assisting his teammates quite a bit in their training," he added, citing the veteran SAR bowler.

    Just hours later, Ho Yuen-kei clinched a second gold medal for Hong Kong at the South Paris Arena.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The third time has proven to be a charm for Ho, who defeated Australia's Jamieson Leeson 4-2 in the women's individual BC3 final.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "This gold medal isn't just for me. It's for everyone who helped me and for all the audience," she said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I hope our 23 athletes at the Paralympics in France show that we aren't just doing well because we have worked very hard despite our disabilities. We want to send a message that we're all the same and share the Hong Kong spirit of never giving up."

     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Paralympic debutant was defeated by China's Lin Ximei at the women's individual BC4.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I am not very satisfied with my overall performance ... I was too nervous, so I wasn't playing as freely as I should, but I am still very happy to be able to win a silver medal," Cheung said as she looked ahead to the mixed pairs competition.

     Wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan finished on the podium for the second straight Games, this time winning a silver as he lowered the curtain for his illustrious career.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 39-year-old veteran was beaten by world number one Japanese Daiki Kajiwara in straight games of 10-21 in the men's singles WH2.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The result was still one step better than his bronze-medal finish in Tokyo three years ago.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Speaking after the match, a tearful Chan said waist pain affected his performance.
     <br/>

     "I really put in a lot of effort. Before the competition, my waist was so painful that I couldn't even turn around. I had to ask the therapist for help, and take medication," he revealed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I want to compete like a 20-year-old, but I haven't been able to do that in recent years."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But there was heartbreak for fellow SAR shuttler Chu Man-kai, who missed out on a medal after losing to his Brazil's Vitor Tavares 2-1 in the men's singles SH6 bronze medal match.

     It wasn't quite a happy ending for the two Hong Kong table tennis players either.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Leung Chung-yan concluded his Paralympic debut when he was beaten in the last 16 of the men's singles MS11 by Peter Palos of Hungary.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the women's, Ng Mui-wui also bowed out after losing to her Brazilian opponent 3-0 in the WS11 singles round of 16.

     In the pool, swimmer Chan Yui-lam finished seventh in the women's 100 metres breaststroke SB14 final.

     She earlier won a silver medal for Hong Kong in the 100 metres butterfly S14 final.

 Germany men's football coach Julian Nagelsmann said Monday he had tapped Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich to take over as national team captain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kimmich was a "role model for the whole group", Nagelsmann said at a press conference ahead of Germany's Nations League fixture against Hungary in Duesseldorf on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He always gives his all, he always wants to train – sometimes too much – he is never tired, he always wants to win," Nagelsmann said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich, 29, was "number one" in a player leadership group alongside Real Madrid defender Antonio Ruediger and Arsenal striker Kai Havertz, Nagelsmann said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three had a "good connection" with the rest of the squad, the coach added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich takes over from Ilkay Gundogan, who captained Germany at Euro 2024 on home soil before retiring from international football in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich has served as vice-captain of Germany since September 2023, having been promoted to the role behind Gundogan by former coach Hansi Flick, and is one of the country's most experienced players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder will be tasked with leading a new generation of German footballers, with Gundogan as well as 2014 World Cup winners Toni Kroos, Thomas Mueller and Manuel Neuer all retiring from international duty in recent weeks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan has wrapped up his illustrious career by collecting a silver medal for Hong Kong, China at the Paralympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old veteran insisted he was proud of his performance, despite not being at his best on the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two came up short against Daiki Kajiwara, the top seed from Japan, losing 10-21, 10-21 in the men's singles WH2 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was still one step better than his bronze-medal finish in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, a tearful Chan revealed lower back pain hampered his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I really put in a lot of effort. Before the competition, my waist was so painful that I couldn't even turn around. I had to ask the therapist for help, and take medications," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to compete like a 20-year-old, but I haven't been able to do that in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stood by his decision to hang up his racquet, saying he wanted to have a good rest and recuperate from the "tormenting" chronic spasms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was heartbreak for fellow SAR shuttler Chu Man-kai, who missed out on a medal after losing to Brazil's Vitor Tavares 21-23, 21-16, 12-21 in the men's singles SH6 bronze medal match.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Customs officer has died after his vehicle fell into the sea from Shenzhen Bay Bridge on Monday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at about 9 pm on Monday of a traffic accident on the northbound route of the Shenzhen Bay Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, chief inspector Chui Wing-luen said the road was dry and there was no road maintenance work at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Officers found two skid marks on the fast lane of the road and a damaged road maintenance sign on the slow lane. There were also signs of impact on the railings. We believed the vehicle plunged off the bridge after the accident," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fire Services Department said the diving team took over two hours to locate the vehicle, and rescuers retrieved the driver's body from the car at around midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An assistant divisional officer Yu Wai-wah said conditions weren't favourable for the search and rescue mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The water is shallow and the environment is dark. The visibility is very low underwater, which made the search more difficult," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the driver was sent to Tin Shui Wai Hospital where he was later certified dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said there were no surveillance cameras at the scene, but officers would inspect the vehicle and try and find out how fast it was travelling at the time of the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner of Customs and Excise Louise Ho expressed deep condolences over the passing of the officer, who died while heading to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the man was a senior customs officer stationed at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point.
