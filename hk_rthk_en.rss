<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 36 points, including 10 in overtime after Jaylen Brown's tying 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Boston Celtics rallied just in time for a 133-128 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jrue Holiday added a season-high 28 points and Brown finished with 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who knocked down 13 3-pointers and scored 56 points in the paint against a Celtics team still playing without 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who twice turned it over with a three-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown made them pay for the second one, hitting a 3 from the corner with Siakam right in his face to tie it at 117.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana went back ahead 123-121 when Haliburton hit all three free throws after being fouled with 1:46 remaining. Tatum then muscled in a layup and was fouled by T.J. McConnell. He completed the three-point play to put Boston ahead for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers turned it over again, this time by Haliburton. The ball found its way to Tatum at the top of key. He pumped, sidestepped a defender and sunk a 3 to make it 127-123 with 43 seconds left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Derrick White and Siakam traded layups. Holiday was fouled and hit two free throws to give Boston a 131-125 cushion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 2 is Thursday night in Boston.(AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is at the forefront of the international fight against corruption, Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday, while vowing to sustain the territory's "pioneering role" in anti-graft work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told the opening ceremony of a symposium in Wan Chai that the SAR has a clean and efficient government and zero tolerance for corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-day event, co-hosted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities, attracted more than 500 participants, including anti-corruption experts, legal professionals and academics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong maintains a robust regulatory regime in line with international standards, and is renowned globally for its clean and efficient government, level-playing field for doing business, sound rule of law, a judiciary with independent judicial power, and zero tolerance for corruption," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the anti-corruption body had championed the fight against corruption in the city for half a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a priority of the Hong Kong SAR government to sustain our pioneering role in combating corruption. We are pleased and proud to back the ICAC in widening its international network and cooperating with overseas counterparts," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed, as well, to ensuring that our legal framework and anti-corruption institutions, as well as public and private sector governance, reflect the highest international obligations and standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Woo, the commissioner of the anti-graft body, told the same event that the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption had organised 70 training courses for more than 40 agencies around the world since it was established in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there would be a training programme on the use of innovation and technology to combat and prevent corruption following the symposium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A unique feature of this training programme is a three-day study tour to the city of Changsha of China. Participants will witness first-hand China's latest development and anti-corruption initiative during the trip," Woo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the symposium was the signing of memoranda of understanding between the ICAC and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as anti-corruption authorities from Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British police on Tuesday were investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time champions Kolkata Knight Riders pummelled Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets in the qualifier to waltz into the final of the Indian Premier League [IPL] on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mitchell Starc produced a three-wicket burst to rattle Hyderabad, who managed a below-par 159 before they were all out with three balls left in their innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kolkata romped home with 6.2 overs to spare after unbeaten half-centuries by Venkatesh Iyer [51] and skipper Shreyas Iyer [58].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hyderabad will get another chance to make Sunday's final when they clash with the winners of Wednesday's eliminator between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Starc entered the league as its most expensive player following his US$2.98 million deal with Kolkata, but he struggled for wickets in the first half of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-arm seamer was bang on the money on Tuesday though as he removed compatriot Travis Head for a duck and sent back Nitish Kumar Reddy and Shahbaz Ahmed in successive deliveries to rock Hyderabad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahul Tripathi [55], Heinrich Klaasen [32] and skipper Pat Cummins [30] took Hyderabad past the 150-mark but it was not enough to test Kolkata's formidable batting lineup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Sunil Narine gave Kolkata a flying start before Venkatesh and Shreyas plundered 97 runs off 44 balls to seal an easy victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rajasthan Royals will take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the eliminator at the same venue on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq climbed to a fresh record on Tuesday following a choppy session after a smattering of mixed earnings and muted Federal Reserve commentary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There really isn't much economic news to speak of," said Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin, who pointed to Wednesday's earnings report from Nvidia as one of the highlights of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Nvidia rose 0.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,832, up 0.2 percent for the day and a record for the second straight session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones also advanced 0.2 percent to 19,872, along with the S&P 500, which stood at 5,321.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cresset's Ablin said the stock market is probably "overbought" at this point, adding that, "relative to bonds, the stock market is probably the most expensive it's been since the financial crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices scored records last week following data showing a moderation in inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Lowe's dropped 1.9 percent after earnings topped analyst expectations. However, revenues for the home-improvement retailer fell about four percent to US$21.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump Media & Technology Group slumped 8.7 percent after reporting a net loss of US$327.6 million in the quarter ending March 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disney nudged up 0.1 percent following news the company's animation studio Pixar is laying off about 14 percent of its staff. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians evacuate Kamal Adwan hospital following an Israeli strike. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754129_1_20240522034215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Gaza's last two functioning hospitals, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan, are barely operational, doctors and the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday with the Israel-Hamas war now in its eighth month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hospital officials said Israeli forces had fired on the facilities and that snipers had been deployed near one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today marks the third day of the siege on Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza," said the hospital's acting director Dr Mohammad Saleh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He reported that Israeli forces had been "firing at the hospital buildings" and that "snipers" have taken up position in nearby houses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh said the "southern wall" of the hospital "has been destroyed" and "all medical staff and patients" are inside the hospital wards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moving around the hospital was "extremely difficult," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But staff still had to transfer water "from the second building to the first one because the occupation (Israeli) forces hit the first building with a shell on the fifth floor yesterday (Monday), destroying the water tanks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva that "148 hospital staff, 22 patients and their companions are trapped inside" the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO regularly visited Al-Awda in April to deliver medical supplies and fuel, but Ghebreyesus also reported snipers aiming at the building and artillery hitting the fifth floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dounia Dekhili, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Gaza, said "nothing is coming in or out" of the hospital because of fears of sniper fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our operating theatre supervisor has been hiding for a few days, he can hear gunshots," Dekhili said after speaking to the man inside Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh did not report any casualties, but said the episode was reminiscent of the last Israeli military operation in the area of the northern Gaza hospital, which is located next to the Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Israeli forces besieged Al-Awda for days, killing two staff and detaining others, MSF reported at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has yet to comment on the operation in Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday also saw patients and staff being evacuated from another north Gaza hospital, Kamal Adwan, said its director Dr Hossam Abu Safia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the hospital is being evacuated of the wounded, patients, and medical staff," he said, adding that "there are several patients that the medical teams have not been able to evacuate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "the reception and emergency entrance gate of Kamal Adwan Hospital was targeted by an artillery shell from the Israeli army," as soldiers advanced towards the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the Palestinian Territories, said on Tuesday from Jerusalem that the hospital's intensive care unit reception area had been hit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the moment, 20 health staff and 13 patients remain," Peeperkorn said, adding that "these are ... functional hospitals we cannot afford to lose," referring to both Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the only two functional hospitals remaining in northern Gaza. Ensuring their ability to deliver health services is imperative," Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.

  Israeli troops have previously raided other medical facilities in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, the territory's largest hospital, now reduced to rubble after a March operation, the WHO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military accuses Hamas of using hospitals as command centres to plan and launch attacks against its forces, a charge the militant group denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza Strip has been gripped by war since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,647 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's defence lawyers rested their case on Tuesday – without the former president following through on a vow to testify – as the judge planned jury deliberations in the historic criminal trial for early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After approximately five weeks, 19 witnesses, reams of documents and sometimes salacious testimony, judgment day in the first ever trial of a former US president was drawing closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York law means the trial has not been shown on television and experts are divided on whether the airing of Trump's dirty laundry is having much of a political impact. However, with a clash against President Joe Biden less than six months away, the looming jury verdict represents a moment of acute peril for the Republican.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Juan Merchan told jurors that closing arguments would take place next Tuesday when each side would make their pitch to the 12 New Yorkers who will ultimately decide Trump's fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will expect you will begin your deliberations hopefully at some point on Wednesday," Merchan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers have sought to undermine key testimony against the former president, who is accused of illegally covering up hush money paid to a porn star over an alleged encounter that could have derailed his successful 2016 White House bid against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Robert Costello was grilled on emails he sent to prosecution star witness Michael Cohen after the FBI raided him in 2018, with Trump's lawyers seeking to undermine Cohen and the prosecution case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costello sparred with Merchan on Monday, prompting the magistrate to rebuke him for poor courtroom etiquette. Trump, in one of his regular tirades outside the courtroom, accused Merchan of being a "tyrant" in what he claimed was a "show trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Monday, both sides asked their final questions of Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and ultra-loyal fixer who eventually turned on his boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lawyer Todd Blanche also probed Cohen's loyalty to Trump and then to the prosecution, looking to show jurors that Cohen is self-serving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche vied to goad Cohen, who has a reputation for a short temper that could have hurt him on the stand – but the witness largely maintained his composure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Blanche finished with him, the prosecution returned for redirect, with prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asking Cohen what the whole experience has meant for him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire life has been turned upside down," Cohen said, emotion in his voice. "I lost my law licence, my financial security..., my family's happiness... just to name a few."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout the trial, which has upended the political and legal order, Trump has complained his 2024 election campaign for another White House term is being stymied by the weeks-long court proceedings, which he has to attend every day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did so again on Monday, complaining to journalists he's "not allowed to have anything to do with politics because I'm sitting in a very freezing cold, dark room for the last four weeks. It's very unfair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling the case politicised, a coterie of leading Republicans have stood in the wings behind him as he gives remarks to reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The growing list includes several lawmakers eyeing Trump's vice presidential pick, including Ohio Senator JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet despite the palace intrigue and courtroom drama, the charges ultimately hinge on financial records, and whether falsifying them was done with intent to sway the 2016 presidential vote. (AFP)

    Pochettino leaves Chelsea after just one season

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has left his job as Chelsea manager by mutual consent after one season in charge, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "On behalf of everyone at Chelsea, we would like to express our gratitude to Mauricio for his service this season," sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will be welcome back to Stamford Bridge any time and we wish him all the very best in his future coaching career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino joined Chelsea ahead of the 2023-24 season when he replaced interim manager Frank Lampard as the club's new owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital looked to freshen things up at Stamford Bridge after finishing 12th in the previous campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Chelsea started the season poorly and found themselves in the bottom half of the standings despite spending more than any club in Europe, Pochettino managed to guide the London club to sixth in the Premier League standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speculation had been rife that the former Paris St Germain and Tottenham Hotspur boss would be gone after just one year in charge but Pochettino remained tight-lipped about his future when asked after their final game of the season on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to the Chelsea ownership group and sporting directors for the opportunity to be part of this football club's history," Pochettino said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club is now well positioned to keep moving forward in the Premier League and Europe in the years to come." (Reuters)

    UK blood scandal victims to receive payouts this year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="British government minister John Glen said victims would receive interim payments of £210,000 (US$267,000) within 90 days. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754122_1_20240522012213.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Victims of a decades-long contaminated blood scandal that has killed about 3,000 people in Britain will start receiving final compensation payments this year, the government announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people, including children, were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood between the 1970s and early 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims are still dying from what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It follows similar scandals including the wrongful prosecution for fraud of hundreds of UK Post Office workers because of faulty software, and the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which falsely blamed football fans for the tragedy that killed 97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bombshell report released on Monday found the tainted blood affair was covered up by successive governments and health officials, and largely could have been avoided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued a "wholehearted and unequivocal" apology and promised compensation for everyone affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Updating parliament on those plans on Tuesday, government minister John Glen said victims would receive interim payments of £210,000 (US$267,000) within 90 days, before the final scheme becomes operational.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our expectation is that final payments will start before the end of the year," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Glen said there was "no restriction" on the total cost of the package, which according to media reports could total more than £10 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friends, family members and carers of those infected will also be eligible for compensation, he announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compensation will be paid to the estate of any person who has died from the scandal and money will be distributed either in a lump sum or via regular payments, Glen added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Brian Langstaff's report, running to more than 2,500 pages, found a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It concluded that blood donors were not screened properly, the risk of AIDS was downplayed and too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak's official spokesman told reporters on Tuesday: "We must fundamentally rebalance the system so that we finally address this pattern so familiar from other inquiries like Hillsborough where innocent victims have to fight for decades just to be believed and heard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work together across government, our health services and civil society to ensure that nothing like this can ever happen in our country again." (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks dipped early on Tuesday, edging back from recent records following muted Federal Reserve commentary and mixed earnings.

    Man Utd's Rashford left out of England's Euros squad

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eight goals in 42 appearances for his club this season has not been enough to earn Marcus Rashford an England place. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754117_1_20240521234042.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marcus Rashford paid for his poor season as the Manchester United forward was left out of England boss Gareth Southgate's provisional 33-man squad for Euro 2024 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and Chelsea skipper Reece James were among the other big names to miss out on the squad, that must be trimmed to a maximum of 26 before the tournament in Germany begins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is rewarded for the Eagles' brilliant end to the Premier League season with his first-ever call up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite and Liverpool duo Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones are the other uncapped players selected with Southgate short on defensive options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England face Bosnia and Herzegovina on June 3 and Iceland four days later before jetting off for Germany, where they are one of the favourites to win the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wealth of options available to Southgate in attacking areas means Rashford misses out on a major international tournament for the first time since the 2014 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rashford has scored just eight times in 42 appearances for his club this season and only recently returned from injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henderson's move to Ajax in January after a short spell in Saudi Arabia has not done enough to earn the 33-year-old a place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same goes for Jadon Sancho despite his renaissance on his return to Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund on loan from United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raheem Sterling and Kalvin Phillips were also overlooked despite shining for Southgate in the past at major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, who fired Manchester City to the Premier League title on Sunday, and Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka are included as part of a fearsome collection of creative talent to supply England's all-time top goalscorer Harry Kane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's men begin their quest to win a major tournament for the first time in 58 years against Serbia on June 16 before facing Denmark and Slovenia in Group C.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squad:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), James Trafford (Burnley)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defenders: Kyle Walker, John Stones (both Manchester City), Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire (both Manchester United), Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Jarell Quansah, Joe Gomez (both Liverpool), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Kieran Trippier (Newcastle), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Lewis Dunk (Brighton)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Midfielders: Declan Rice (Arsenal), Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Trent Alexander-Arnold, Curtis Jones (both Liverpool)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forwards: Harry Kane (Bayern Munich/GER), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), James Maddison (Tottenham), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid/ESP), Phil Foden, Jack Grealish (both Manchester City), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace) (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau has proposed that students taking the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education economics exam can skip part of the test from 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It came after the bureau announced that students would be allowed to only take the compulsory test for the Chinese history DSE exam from 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a circular published on Monday, the bureau said the requirement for students to choose one of the elective tests would be removed for the economics DSE exam, and that students only sitting the compulsory paper would be rewarded a score of level 5 at most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said this would allow students to focus on studying for the compulsory part of the exam to enhance learning effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the measure would be implemented at secondary 4 starting from the 2025-26 school year, and would apply to the 2028 DSE exams.

<div class="itemFullText">
 One passenger was killed and 30 injured after a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence en route on Tuesday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Bangkok, officials and the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We deeply apologise for the traumatic experience that our passengers and crew members suffered on this flight," the airline said, adding it was working with Thai authorities to provide all necessary assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One male passenger died, Kittipong Kittikachorn, Director of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, said. Eighteen people have been hospitalised and 12 are being treated in hospitals, Singapore Airlines said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately possible to reconstruct the incident from publicly available tracking data, but a spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said it was analysing data at around 3:49 pm Hong Kong time, which shows the plane tilting upwards and return to its cruising altitude over the space of a minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger who was on the flight said that the incident involved the sensation of rising then falling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Suddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking so I started bracing for what was happening, and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling," Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on board the flight said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said with regard to data showing a drop in height, "our initial thinking is the turbulence event is prior to the standard descent from 37,000 to 31,000 feet. That appears to just be a flight level change in preparation for landing".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Boeing 777-300ER plane with 211 passengers and 18 crew was headed to Singapore when it made the emergency landing, the airline said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore news outlet CNA carried blurry pictures supplied by readers that it said appeared to be from the flight. They showed anxious passengers clinging to seats, with oxygen masks hanging from above, personal items strewn across the aisle and rubbish spilled on the floor of the cabin crew area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suvarnabhumi airport said the plane requested an emergency landing at 4:35 pm Hong Kong time and landed at 4:51 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognised as one of the world's leading airlines and is a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines has had seven accidents according to records by the Aviation Safety Network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

 Five people have been killed in a coal mine accident in northeast China's Heilongjiang province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The accident happened on Monday night at the Xing'an coal mine in the city of Hegang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the company that operated the mine, nine people were trapped, with four of them rescued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A preliminary investigation showed that the accident was caused by the leakage of liquid carbon dioxide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mine was run by the Hegang mining company under the Heilongjiang Longmay Group. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong's business school on Tuesday said it was investigating "a small number of cases" in which people submitted forged documents to gain admission to the school.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said it had found that some agencies, which claimed to offer "guaranteed admission", had forged application documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it would not tolerate any acts of dishonesty or academic misconduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to academic integrity and to creating a fair learning environment," the school said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we understand that securing a place in a top graduate programme is not easy, it is regrettable that this competition has attracted individuals who resort to deceitful means in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said that if any of the cases were confirmed to be true, it would take the necessary disciplinary and legal action, including withdrawing offers of admission and referring the cases to the relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One HKU student told RTHK she was surprised that some people could cheat their way into the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's shocking to me...it's quite unfair to other students who have worked very hard to get into the school, while others can just fake it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another student said the university should ensure fairness in admission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For future students who want to go to the university...the school needs to have a stricter process for checking their certificates," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued its Red Rainstorm Warning Signal at 2.50pm on Tuesday, after the amber signal had been in force for almost five hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The observatory said heavy rain was continuing to affect the city, and a band of thundery showers over the southern part of the territory was edging closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the downpours were particularly heavy on Lantau, where there could be serious flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said more than 90 millimetres of hourly rainfall was recorded around noon in Cheung Sha on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said the city's schools should ensure that conditions were safe before allowing students to leave for the day.

    Walled City film set could become tourist hotspot

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the government is considering turning the film set of local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" into a tourist site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing on Hong Kong's mega events, Wong said the movie set, which resembles the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City, has been well maintained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With regards to the set used in the movie 'Walled In', discussions are taking place. The set has been dismantled, but it's still there. They've been keeping it in rather good condition," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions are ongoing as to whether they can let us have some parts of the set and it will be put up for display at a suitable location in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong will host 106 mega events in the latter half of this year, a couple less than the 108 organised in the first six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the events still to come are expected to attract more visitors compared to those already held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of events taking place in the first half of this year is actually more or less similar to the number of events taking place in the second half. But in terms of scale, we noted that some of the events in the second half actually have a much larger capacity in terms of attracting visitors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that the number of visitors coming to Hong Kong for those mega events will actually be bigger than those in the first half."

    Pay rises dip this year: Jobsdb

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, says more young people are hoping to work on the mainland.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Salary increases this year are slightly lower than last year, according to a new report by Jobsdb.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The employment platform polled nearly 3,400 workers between February and  March, and found that their average pay rise in 2024 was 3.2 percent. That's almost one percentage point lower than last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employees in analytics had the biggest increase at 7.2 percent, followed by legal and compliance, and engineering at about five percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers in the design, retail sales and manufacturing sectors were at the bottom end with increments of less than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, said the lower pay rise should not be a concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is roughly within the range of salary increases in Hong Kong in the last ten years, and this number is also above inflation, which was roughly around two percent in March,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that industries like hospitality and tourism had benefited from the rebounded in visitor numbers, and their staff had a better than average salary rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We do see a significant improvement in the salary and benefits package within the hospitality and tourism job functions. Firstly, within this segment, there's an average increase of 4.2 percent," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And over 80 percent of those surveyed within this segment actually received salary increments, so that's a pretty positive outlook.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said that jobseekers, particularly those under 25, had shown more interest in working on the mainland which has become the second most popular destination after Australia for Hongkongers seeking work outside the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The policies implemented by the Hong Kong government to encourage more integration with the Greater Bay Area are probably showing some results, increasing the awareness of young people looking to work in the GBA,” he said.

    RAISe+ results will be published soon: Paul Chan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government will soon release the results of a scheme aimed at promoting the commercialisation of scientific research results and matching university projects with reliable investors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Greater Bay Area Science Forum - Hong Kong Forum at the University of Hong Kong, Chan said the authorities have been rolling out various measures to promote the commercialisation of scientific research results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the measures, he said, is the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) that was launched last October and is aimed at promoting collaboration between the government, universities, as well as the technology and research industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very pleased to report to you that the results of the first round of evaluation results of the scheme will be published within this month, and we will fund over 20 projects covering various fields, including health and medical sciences, new materials, new energy, and artificial intelligence robots et cetera,” Chan told the participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that authorities will also conduct more collaboration with cities in the Greater Bay Area, especially the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, to create a vigorous technology and innovation ecosystem, while matching global capital with scientific institutions and universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the government will prepare and establish a third InnoHK research and development cluster in the second half of this year, to ramp up the SAR's tech transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new cluster will focus on advanced manufacturing, materials, energy, and sustainable development, while the existing clusters focus on healthcare-related technologies, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, could play a positive role in guiding funds by being a ‘super connector’. The innovation and technology industries as well as the finance industry in the Greater Bay Area can support each other, and they are equivalent to combining the competitive strengths of the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that over 50 key enterprises, many in the innovation and tech fields, have been attracted to the SAR since late 2022, and it's estimated they will bring in investments worth more than HK$40 billion and create 13,000 jobs in the coming few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 120,000 individuals have recently arrived in the SAR via the government’s various talent import schemes, with 20 percent of them working in the innovation and technology industries, Chan said.

    CE warns against citizen sting ops on Uber drivers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee urged people without proper training to refrain from mounting sting operations, after taxi drivers went undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cabbies raised eyebrows and caused controversy by travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police had been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee warned there were risks for people taking matters into their own hands, and that they should refer the issue to law enforcement officers instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These operations should be undertaken by law enforcement agencies. And the law enforcement agencies that take these undercover actions will have to abide by rules and regulations. The officers involved have been well-trained. They act within the framework of the law," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need training to handle emergency situations. Without proper training and without adequate legal understanding, I advise people not to do it, because they may break the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted the Transport and Logistics Bureau would report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services in July.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that clear key performance indicators (KPIs) must be set for the development and operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, adding that government money must be spent carefully.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment ahead of the weekly Exco meeting after the chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, said museums at the arts hub may have to reduce the days they are open unless more funds are secured in the next year or so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government is in communication with the authority regarding viable funding options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have high expectations of the successful operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, and it has been creating value for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In many areas, it has been doing a job which satisfies the expectations and wishes of the community and the government, but we want to ensure that there will be a long-term viable financing plan with good KPIs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that the district was designed to be self-financing following its initial endowment from the government.

    Govt to release findings on waste charging next week

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government attached importance to people's views on the waste charging scheme, as officials prepare to present their plans to the Legislative Council next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a survey by the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao found that more than 90 percent of the 30,000 people polled were against the pay-as-you-throw scheme, while more than 70 percent said it should be scrapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme has been on trial since April in 14 different locations, including at homes, shops and restaurants. Officials had previously said it remained to be seen whether a full roll-out would take place as planned on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the government was assessing the experience gained during the trial and the challenges that may arise in implementing the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed the government was taking the views of society seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In my opinion, a policy that would affect more than seven million citizens should be carefully considered. Even though the law was drafted before this government took office, we should still consider how to implement it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will explain to the Legislative Council next week what we have learnt from the pilot, the problems we have identified and the feedback we have received from the community, including through the media."

    Protest song injunction being complied with, govt says

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said internet service providers have been complying with a court injunction against the protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said hyperlinks to the song could no longer be found on local platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've noted that there's no link shown on any local platform relating to the song, and also Google Search doesn't show any link to the song in question either," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to monitor the situation to see whether there is any non-compliance with the court order. If we notice such instances, then we will notify the platform on the contents of the court order."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction against the protest song, banning anyone with seditious intent from playing or performing it on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said last week that it would comply with the court ruling, restricting viewing of 32 banned links related to the song in Hong Kong.

    HK to host over 200 mega events this year: CE

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HK to host over 200 mega events this year: CE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754004_1_20240521104618.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host dozens more mega events this year which were expected to draw millions of visitors, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's leader also said arts and culture shows, sports competitions, trade exhibitions and financial summits would be among the more than 100 events held in the latter half of the year, including brand new ones such as a performing arts expo and a fashion design week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The total number of mega events over the year is increased from 150 to [over] 210. That means there will be [at least] one mega event every two days," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think that these mega events will attract about 1.7 million visitors. They will bring with them about HK$7.2 billion, which is about HK$4.3 billion in economic gain.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said Hong Kong welcomed more than 14 million visitors in the first four months, double from the same period a year ago, and that there was a surge of tourists coming from the United States, Canada and Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We reckon that for every 1.5 million visitors, there will be a 0.1 percent growth in GDP. For long-term stay visitors, they will bring even a higher percentage point in growth of our GDP," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added his administration would seek more measures from Beijing that benefits the SAR, including raising the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shaman Chellaram, a senior director in valuation and advisory services at the investment management firm Colliers, said the strong Hong Kong dollar had discouraged people from visiting, as it is more expensive for tourists to travel to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Chellaram said these mega events could offer tourists a variety of new experiences and attractions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are always attracted to exciting things. And what we're seeing in the market at the moment is that the global travel trend is geared towards more experiences. And if those mega events that the city has planned out for the rest of the year can really curate a unique experience, then that will really lead to a jump in tourism numbers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chellaram also believed that having mega events would boost the local tourism industry by bringing in more visitors to the SAR.

    Women's tennis signs partnership with Saudi's PIF

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Saudi Public Investment Fund [PIF] will become the first-ever naming partner of the WTA's rankings, the two organisations announced on Monday, as part of a multi-year partnership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement marks the PIF's latest foray into tennis, after the men's ATP tour also signed a multi-year "strategic partnership" earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we look forward to sharing the journey of our talented players across the season, as we continue to grow the sport, creating more fans of tennis and inspiring more young people to take up the game," WTA Ventures CEO Marina Storti said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement marks the latest move in a dramatic shift by the women's tour, which was previously reluctant to embrace Saudi partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outgoing CEO Steve Simon said last year that Saudi Arabia posed "big issues" as a host for women's tennis events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was announced in April that the season-ending WTA Finals will be held in the Saudi capital Riyadh from 2024-2026, with the Saudi Tennis Federation offering record prize money of US$15.25 million this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came despite pushback from retired greats Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, while Russian Daria Kasatkina, who came out as gay in 2022, also expressed reservations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's rights activists and members of the LGBTQ community accused the country of "sports-washing", criticising Saudi Arabia's human rights record as it pumps huge amounts of money into soccer, Formula One and the LIV Golf circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed AlSayyad, head of corporate brand at PIF, said the organisation would "continue to be a catalyst for the growth of women’s sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with the WTA to increase participation and inspire the next generation of talent," he said in a statement. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said on Monday that the bodies of four hostages retrieved from Gaza last week were found in tunnels under Jabalia, where troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The army said last week it had recovered the bodies of Ron Benjamin, Yitzhak Gelerenter, Shani Louk, and Amit Buskila, all of whom it said had been killed in Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their remains were recovered "from underground tunnels in Jabalia in northern Gaza," the army said late on Monday in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a military operation, Israeli soldiers searched a suspected building in which a tunnel shaft was located, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Soldiers then entered the underground tunnel route in a night operation and inside it conducted combat," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the fighting the soldiers "located the bodies of the hostages and rescued them from the tunnels," the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four were taken hostage during the attack on the Nova music festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the event held near Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fighters from Hamas crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the more than 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 124 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 35,562 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since early May the Israeli military has been engaged in renewed street battles in northern and central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the army said that the fighting in the northern town of Jabalia was "perhaps the fiercest" in over seven months of war. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gains by several large tech companies pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record on Monday, on an overall mixed day for US equities as weakness at JPMorgan Chase dragged down the Dow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Microsoft climbed 1.2 percent as it unveiled new PC offerings that feature generative artificial intelligence tools built directly into its Windows operating system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip giant Nvidia also advanced ahead of its earnings release due later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JPMorgan slumped 4.5 percent, with analysts attributing the decline to CEO Jamie Dimon signalling he is closer to retiring from the US banking giant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 0.7 percent to 16,794, topping last week's record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones, meanwhile, slid 0.5 percent to 39,806, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,308.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Nvidia earnings, this week's calendar includes Federal Reserve minutes from the May 1 meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a mixed session," said Peter Cardillo, of Spartan Capital. "I kind of think it's going to be this way until some new catalyst."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Results from some leading retailers, including Target and Lowe's, are also on this week's plate. Strong results from Walmart last week added to market momentum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other equities, tech company Jabil shot up 5.2 percent after announcing that Michael Dastoor was promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive officer. The company also confirmed its profit forecast. (AFP)

    UK PM 'sorry' for cover-up over infected blood scandal
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The tainted blood scandal has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753958_1_20240521024738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday apologised to thousands of people infected with contaminated blood in a decades-long scandal that a damning report concluded was covered up and largely could have been avoided.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood in Britain between the 1970s and early 1990s, the Infected Blood Inquiry concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 3,000 people died, and more will follow, in what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am truly sorry," Sunak told the House of Commons, calling the findings of the long-awaited report "a day of shame for the British state."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Time and again people in positions of power and trust had the chance to stop the transmission of those infections and failed to do so," he added, promising "whatever it costs" to compensate victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total figure is expected to be above £10 billion (US$12 billion) when the government announces the package on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, running to more than 2,500 pages, laid bare a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one school where 122 pupils with haemophilia were given infected blood products between 1970 and 1987, only 30 now survive, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to report that it could largely, though not entirely, have been avoided," concluded its author, judge Brian Langstaff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His team found that successive governments and health professionals failed to mitigate risks despite it being apparent by the early 1980s that the cause of AIDS could be transmitted by blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blood donors were not screened properly and blood products were imported from abroad, including from the United States where drug users and prisoners were used for donations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Viewing the response of the NHS and of government overall, the answer to the question, 'Was there a cover-up?' is that there has been," the report stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not in the sense of a handful of people plotting in an orchestrated conspiracy to mislead, but in a way that was more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling in its implications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this way there has been a hiding of much of the truth," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of the 3,000 patients who died, many more were left with lifelong health problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Langstaff said that "the scale of what happened is horrifying" and said people's suffering had been compounded by repeated denials and false assurances that they had received good treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I have found is that disaster was no accident. People put their trust in doctors and the government to keep them safe and that trust was betrayed," Langstaff told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Theresa May launched the inquiry – one of the country's largest – in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campaigners hailed the report as the culmination of a decades-long struggle but noted that it came too late for many of the victims who will never see justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Evans, chairman of the Tainted Blood campaign group, described the report as "momentous" and that he felt "validated and vindicated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been gaslit for generations... Sometimes we felt like we were shouting into the wind during the last 40 years," he told reporters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Feyenoord coach Arne Slot was on Monday confirmed as Jurgen Klopp's successor at Liverpool by the Premier League club.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club said in a statement that the Dutchman, 45, would take up the position of head coach on June 1, subject to a work permit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot's arrival has been an open secret, with Liverpool reportedly agreeing a compensation deal worth up to £9.4 million (US$12 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed Anfield was his next destination at his final pre-match press conference at the Eredivisie club on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp announced his departure in January and took charge of his final game on Sunday, a 2-0 win against Wolves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his final speech to the Anfield crowd, the German urged fans to throw their full support behind Slot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me," he said. "You go all-in from the first day. And you keep believing and you push the team." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen has stayed largely composed and on topic during cross-examination. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753952_1_20240521003251.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's trial on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star approached its final stages on Monday, with closing arguments expected early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Due to an upcoming holiday weekend as well as legal squabbles over jury instructions among other yet undisclosed "issues," Judge Juan Merchan told the court "it's become apparent that we are not going to be able to sum up tomorrow" as he had hoped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's still unclear if the defence will present a case – they are not required to – or whether Trump himself will testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most experts say it is highly unlikely he will take the stand in his watershed criminal trial, the first ever of a former US president, as it would expose him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination by prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche has raised the prospect his client could step up as a witness, telling the judge last week "that's another decision we need to consider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the prosecution can rest, defence lawyers will first conclude grilling the state's star witness, Michael Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer turned tormentor, recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over several days of questioning that continued on Monday, Trump's lawyers have set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has also probed Cohen's loyalty both past and present, to Trump and the prosecution respectively, looking to show jurors that the former fixer is self-serving and willing to go to great lengths to accomplish his aims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen has said repeatedly he takes "responsibility" for his actions and has faced the consequences. Prior to the trial, including in his books, he had done little to hide his contempt for his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has striven to ruffle Cohen, who has a reputation for a temper that could hurt him on the stand – but the witness has stayed largely composed and on topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story has generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run. (AFP)

    MTR stations better protected from storm flooding
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR has placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753946_2_20240520220635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR has installed a flood detection system at 26 stations, to prepare for the coming rain and typhoon season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The initiative comes after Wong Tai Sin Station was flooded during a heavy downpour last September, resulting in the partial suspension of the Kwun Tong Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, the MTR’s Chief of Airport Segment, Ben Lui, said the rail giant had placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When water reaches the sensors, it will trigger an alarm to the station staff. Upon receiving the alarm, the staff will check the CCTV to confirm if there is flooding. If there is flooding, our staff will set flood barriers and temporarily cordon off the affected area. There will also be announcements for the public to use other exits to leave the station," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui also said the MTR would suspend all services on above ground sections of the network, including the light railway and airport express, whenever the typhoon signal No. 9 or higher was in effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, if trains were still above ground when the second-highest typhoon signal was raised, they would continue to their designated destinations, or at least to major stations such as Yuen Long or Sha Tin, where passengers could find shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR would also provide water and food for affected passengers under such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang said the newly installed flood sensors at station exits would provide early alerts to MTR staff, enabling them to proactively prevent flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Zhang, who's a former MTR engineer, expressed concerns regarding the safety of station staff who would need to set up flood-proof barriers themselves amid extreme weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even for a small station like Wong Tai Sin, there are more than eight entrances, and each entrance has to be installed with floodblocks manually by the station staff. And the manpower is definitely still a concern and also a constraint," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang said the rail operator was thinking about installing automatic flood-proof barriers at stations to minimise the risks to staff safety.

    WikiLeaks founder Assange stalls extradition to US

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday won a legal bid to appeal against his extradition from Britain to the United States on espionage charges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  High Court judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson said Assange had grounds to challenge the UK government’s extradition order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange faces 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over his website’s publication of a trove of classified US documents almost 15 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison after taking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyers for Assange argued Monday the US provided “blatantly inadequate” assurances the WikiLeaks founder would have free press protections if extradited to America to face espionage charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said prosecutors had failed to guarantee that Assange, who is an Australian citizen and claims protections as a journalist for publishing US classified information, could rely on press protections of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. (AP)

    ICC issues arrest warrants for Israeli, Hamas leaders

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday said he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in connection with their actions during the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Karim Khan said that he believes Netanyahu, his defence minister Yoav Gallant and three Hamas leaders — Yehya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — were responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking of the Israeli actions, Khan said in a statement that “the effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known...they include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the Hamas actions on October 7, he said he saw for himself "the devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today. Speaking with survivors, I heard how the love within a family, the deepest bonds between a parent and a child, were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness. These acts demand accountability.” (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s jobless rate remained stable at three percent in the three-month period ending in April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate also remained unchanged, at 1.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 5,700 people were newly employed during the three-month period, bringing the total employment number to 3.69 million. The labour force, meanwhile, increased by about 7,700 to 3.8 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, some 2,000 people became jobless during the period, sending the total number of unemployed to 113,700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of underemployed people stood at 40,500, largely unchanged compared with the previous three-month period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, labour chief Chris Sun said the unemployment rates of various sectors remained low in general, with only small changes observed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects "continued economic growth" to keep the labour market tight in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also noted that there was a monthly average of 75,425 vacancies in the private sector between February and April, which was a decrease of nearly 30 percent on a yearly basis and a drop of 2.7 percent compared with the first three months of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Taiwan Affairs Office said the new leader of the Taiwan region, William Lai, sent "a dangerous signal" by seeking "Taiwan independence" and making provocations to undermine cross-strait peace and stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to Lai's speech as he took office on Monday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said while the mainstream public aspiration on the island is for peace and development, Lai has ignored the public opinion, exposing his nature of being "a worker for Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen also said Lai sought independence by relying on foreign support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No matter how the political situation in Taiwan changes, it will not change the historical and legal fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China," Wang said. (Xinhua and agencies)

 The Development Bureau and Construction Industry Council have launched a new programme to encourage the use of the Smart Site Safety System on construction sites, with applications open on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sites that successfully implement the system, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for frontline staff and electric locks for hazardous areas, would now be recognised with a label.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony of the programme, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn explained the participation rate for the safety system, especially for private sites, was still relatively low, and such labels were believed to increase their safety awareness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The programme aims to encourage more construction sites to adopt the Smart Site Safety System by providing them with a label, or a ‘plaque’, to identify and facilitate monitoring of those sites that have properly installed and applied the system,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We estimate that the first batch of about 100 construction sites will receive the label by July this year.  With an estimated minimum of 500 sites participating, we hope to have all labels issued by the end of the year, covering over 60 percent of all construction sites.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said such labels would be displayed at strategic spots outside the construction sites for recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In other words, everyone will know which sites have such labels. For sites that don’t have such labels. Obviously relevant government departments will pay more attention during their usual inspections. And the construction industry will know which sites haven’t implemented the Smart Site Safety System. I believe this will create a certain pressure,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn added that sites should still be cautious even if they have been issued the “plaque”, saying it could still be scrapped if they don't perform site safety properly.

    More mobilised civil servants report on time: govt

<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung on Monday said more public servants were able to report for duty on time under a mobilisation protocol used during a government-wide drill on handling emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The exercise last month simulated a situation where a super typhoon was approaching Hong Kong, with civil servants called up to assist residents in low-lying areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said the exercise showed that public servants had improved their internal communication, compared to the first drill held about a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Civil Service Bureau] worked with different bureaus and departments and we were able to contact all staff required within 40 minutes. And the relevant bureaus and departments also, within a short period time, contacted their staff members. So 99 percent of our staff members were able to arrive at the designated locations within a specified time. This shows that the communication mechanism worked," she told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that authorities were able to swiftly deliver supplies from storage facilities set up across the city to specified locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, raised concerns about civil servants having to catch up their usual work after being deployed under the mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Yeung said she believes bureaus and departments would take a "compassionate approach".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Say, if the mobilisation exercise [on a work day] completes at 5.30pm, no staff will be asked to go back to their original post to finish their work. The work will be shared among other colleagues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government-wide mobilisation went into effect twice last year, with hundreds of civil servants deployed to help clear up the aftermath of Super Typhoon Saola as well as following torrential downpours in September.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Monday said the government will not delay plans to start keeping the stock markets open during severe weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after reports suggested the authorities could delay bringing in the change until the end of the year or early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending the China Private Equity Summit, Hui said officials are sticking to the original timeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our timeline has not been changed, and it's been clear the whole time. That is, we'll announce relevant details of the implementation by the middle of this year when we publish the results of the public consultation on this regard,” Hui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And when the markets are ready, we'll start implementing relevant arrangements.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No date for the move has been set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Hui told participants at the summit that Hong Kong remains competitive when it comes to firms raising capital, and authorities will continue to attract leading enterprises from the mainland to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Hui also said the SAR government will publish a policy statement regarding the development of artificial intelligence (AI) by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “AI is already being applied in various areas of banking, securities, insurance, accounting, retirement, protection and green finance in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government will strive to capitalise on the opportunities brought by AI while also managing the risks and challenges.”

    Leave policing to the police: taxi association chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi drivers should not be going undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services and the matter should be left to the police, an industry spokesman said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Videos online appear to show cabbies travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, told RTHK he does not agree with such an approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added, however, that there were only 33 prosecutions over unlicensed ride-hailing services last year and the taxi trade is disappointed with the amount of action taken by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ride-hailing services are legal, but if these companies do not verify whether or not the cars in service have a hire car permit, the insurance of these cars already becomes invalid. This becomes a problem for all road users including third-party vehicles, pedestrians, passengers and even the driver of the ride-hailing car," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there is a serious accident and there's no compensation for casualties, people would criticise the SAR's governance and nobody wants to see that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow said he hopes plans for new fleets of taxis will improve services, leading to less demand for ride-hailing firms.

 China on Monday announced sanctions against three US defence companies for selling arms to Taiwan region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry placed General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Boeing Defence, Space & Security on its "unreliable entities list".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms will be barred from engaging in China-related import or export activities, and are forbidden to make new investments in China. In addition, senior executives of the companies are prohibited from entering China, while their work permits will be revoked, along with their visitor and residential status, and the related applications they submit will not be approved.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 11 rebounds and the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves overcame a 20-point, third-quarter deficit to beat the Denver Nuggets 98-90 in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Minnesota advances to the Western Conference finals for the first time in 20 years after winning in Denver for the third time in the series. The Timberwolves won Game 7 against the Sacramento Kings in 2004 to reach the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota, the No. 3 seed, hosts No. 5 Dallas in Game 1 on Wednesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 22 points and Anthony Edwards was 6-for-24 shooting but finished with 18 points, eight rebounds and seven assists to end the Nuggets' bid for a second straight NBA title. Rudy Gobert was big down the stretch, scoring eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nikola Jokic had 34 points and 19 rebounds and Jamal Murray scored 35 points for Denver. It is the second time in six seasons the Nuggets have lost a Game 7 at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota took its first lead since the first quarter on Rudy Gobert's floater early in the fourth quarter and stretched it 77-72. Jokic missed his first six 3-pointers but hit two from deep to keep the Nuggets close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naz Reid, who scored 11 points, hit two free throws, blocked Jokic's floater and had a putback dunk. Edwards drained a 3-pointer off a Murray turnover to put the Timberwolves ahead 92-82 with 3:07 left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denver closed within 93-88 with 1:02 left but Towns tip-in sealed Minnesota's trip to the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets staged a 16-0 run spanning the first and second quarters and led 53-38 at halftime. They pushed it to 58-38 early in the third and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a 17-footer that would have made it a 22-point lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves came storming back, using a 19-3 run to get within 61-57 with 3:05 left in the period. Towns hit a pair of free throws to get Minnesota within two, and Edwards drained a 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left to make it 67-66 heading into the fourth. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iranian state media on Monday said President Ebrahim Raisi died after his helicopter crashed in a mountainous region of the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams had been scouring the area since Sunday afternoon after a helicopter carrying Raisi, the foreign minister and other officials had gone missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early Monday, relief workers located the missing helicopter, with state TV saying the president had died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The servant of Iranian nation, Ayatollah Ebrahim Raisi has achieved the highest level of martyrdom whilst serving the people," state television said on Monday, with Mehr news agency also saying he was dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State television broadcast photos of Raisi, with the voice of a man reciting the Koran playing in the background.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's vice president for executive affairs Mohsen Mansouri posted on X a Koranic verse used to express condolences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams had fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in East Azerbaijan province in the early hours of Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Turkish drone had identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopter's wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said earlier on X. Iranian state news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had earlier said it was "deeply concerned" about Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi after his helicopter went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country. (Agencies)

  Schauffele put the finishing touches on a wire-to-wire victory at the year's second major with a closing six-under-par 65 that left him at 21 under on the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Needing a closing birdie for the win, Schauffele's tee shot at the 18th perched up on the edge of a fairway bunker and forced him to take a compromised stance inside the hazard for his second shot, which he left just in front of the green.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele then displayed nerves of steel as he chipped to six feet from where he drained the biggest birdie of his career for the lowest winning score to par at a major championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau carded a bogey-free seven-under-par 64 to finish two shots ahead of Viktor Hovland [66], whose spirited effort to become the first Norwegian to win a major came undone at the final hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A day that began with seven players within four strokes of overnight co-leaders Schauffele and Collin Morikawa turned into a thrilling three-horse race across the back nine at Valhalla between Schauffele, DeChambeau and Hovland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau and Hovland were playing in the third-to-last pairing and each set up pressure-packed 10-foot birdie putts on the final hole. DeChambeau drained his but Hovland's effort curled away and he went on to make bogey and finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left the outcome in the hands of Schauffele, who was on the par-four 17th where he did well to save par after his tee shot caught a fairway bunker before sealing the deal at the 18th while DeChambeau watched it unfold on a nearby screen. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tyrese Haliburton scored 26 points for the visiting Indiana Pacers, who rode a historic shooting performance to a 130-109 win over the New York Knicks in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series Sunday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indiana shot 67.1 percent (53-of-79) from the field – the highest shooting percentage ever in an NBA playoff game. They broke the previous record held by the 1990 Boston Celtics, who shot 67 percent [63-of-94] in a 157-128 win over the Knicks in a first-round game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers, who overcame series deficits of 2-0 and 3-2, will face the Boston Celtics in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals, scheduled to begin Tuesday night. This is the first trip to the conference finals for Indiana since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks, who played short-handed throughout the series and lost star point guard Jalen Brunson to a fractured left hand in the third quarter Sunday, fell short in their bid to appear in the conference finals for the first time since 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Nembhard and Pascal Siakam each scored 20 points while Aaron Nesmith had 19 points on 8-of-8 shooting for the Pacers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner scored 17 points while T.J. McConnell added 12 points off the bench. The 130 points were the most by a road team in a Game 7 in NBA history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donte DiVincenzo scored 39 points for the Knicks, who played the series without All-Star Julius Randle [out since January with a right shoulder injury]. Mitchell Robinson didn't play after Game 1 due to an aggravation of his left ankle injury while OG Anunoby missed the previous four games with a left hamstring before scoring five points in fewer than five first-quarter minutes Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart played 36-plus minutes Sunday despite an abdominal injury he suffered in Game 6 Friday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alec Burks had 26 points Sunday while Brunson had 17 points and nine assists. Hart tallied 10 points, eight rebounds and five assists before fouling out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks scored the first seven points of the third quarter to begin a 12-3 run that pulled them within 73-67 with 8:06 left. But Indiana answered with a 22-9 run and led by at least 13 throughout the fourth quarter. (Reuters)

    Spain pulls ambassador over Milei speech row

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain recalled its ambassador to Buenos Aires for consultations on Sunday after Argentina's President Javier Milei made derogatory comments about Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's wife during a far-right rally in Madrid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Milei had called Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez "corrupt" during a rally in Madrid organised by the far-right Vox party and attended by many of its international allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said he expected an apology from Milei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other ministers also condemned Milei's speech, in which he described socialism as "cursed and carcinogenic". Sanchez leads Spain's Socialist Party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With his behaviour, Milei has brought the relationship between Spain and Argentina to its most serious state in recent history," Albares said in a video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milei's visit broke with diplomatic protocol as he refused to meet Spain's King Felipe and Sanchez, instead preferring to promote his book alongside Vox leader Santiago Abascal at the party rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on social messaging app X that "attacks against family members of political leaders have no place in our culture".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party (PP), refused to support Madrid's stance, with party sources saying that Sanchez should have provided explanations about the alleged corruption case weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A city court said in April it was looking into accusations of influence peddling and business corruption against Sanchez's wife, brought in a private complaint by Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, an anti-corruption activist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Madrid's prosecuting authority later said it was appealing to have the case thrown out for lack of evidence. Sanchez decided to stay in office after five days of weighing his future once the probe against his wife was announced. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City won an unprecedented fourth straight English top flight title with a 3-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday to pip rivals Arsenal on the final day of a thrilling Premier League season as the fans turned the pitch into a sea of blue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two glorious early goals from league player of the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from Mohammed Kudus before halftime brought West Ham briefly into the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Rodri sealed the victory with a low 59th minute shot from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a phenomenal sixth title in seven years. Fans danced in their seats, belting out: "Champions again!" and "Are you watching Arsenal?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the closest title races in Premier League history, Arsenal could have taken the championship had City dropped points. But the Londoners' 2-1 win in their game against Everton was in vain, leaving them two points behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have the chance of winning the double as they face Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden's already brilliant season got even better when he arrowed the ball into the top corner in the second minute then capped a fine team move to sweep home the second in the 18th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so hard to put into words what we've done today," Foden said. "No team has ever done it. You see what it means to the fans and it means to us. Working all year for this moment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought today we just looked confident and just played our football and in the end it paid off."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder has scored 19 league goals this season and has won six Premier League titles at just 23, making him one of England's best hopes for this year's Euros in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the final whistle, the home fans poured onto the pitch, some letting off blue flares in celebration, while the players hugged each other in joy. (Reuters)

    Bezos' Blue Origin launches first flight since 2022

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bezos' Blue Origin launches first flight since 2022" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753820_1_20240520001226.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin launched a six-person crew – including the first US Black astronaut candidate from the 1960s – from West Texas to the edge of space on Sunday, resuming its centerpiece space tourism business for the first time since its suborbital New Shepard rocket was grounded in 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am ecstatic," Ed Dwight, who at age 90 years and eight months became the oldest person in space, said upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight and the other passengers, seated in a gumdrop-shaped capsule atop the rocket, were launched from Blue Origin facilities near the remote desert town of Van Horn. The rocket separated from the capsule, which then ascended further beyond the boundary of Earth's atmosphere to 105.7km, while the booster returned to land as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule then returned to Earth under parachutes, capping a mission lasting roughly 10 minutes. One of the capsule's three parachutes did not fully inflate, a hitch that may draw scrutiny before the rocket's next flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight was the first Black astronaut candidate who was picked by former US President John Kennedy in 1961 to train as an astronaut, but until now had never flown to space. Dwight stepped out of the capsule once it landed and thrust his fists into the air in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I really didn't need this in my life, but now I need it in my life," Dwight told a Blue Origin interviewer upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin has now flown 37 private astronauts, including in 2021 "Star Trek" star William Shatner, who was 90 years and six months old at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passengers, also including a venture capitalist and a pilot, were paying customers of Blue Origin's space tourism business, though Dwight's seat was sponsored by a space-focused nonprofit and a private foundation. Blue Origin has not disclosed how much it charges customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The grounding of New Shepard, Blue Origin's only active rocket, came after a mid-flight failure in September 2022 during an uncrewed research mission. A structural failure in the rocket's engine nozzle, the company concluded, forced the capsule full of science experiments to abort. (Reuters)

    Verstappen holds off Norris charge in Imola victory

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen held off a late charge by McLaren's Lando Norris to win the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix by less than a second on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's triple Formula One world champion took the chequered flag just 0.725 of a second ahead of the man who beat him at the previous round in Miami and sensed he might snatch another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Verstappen's fifth in seven races this season, the 59th of his career and the third edition in a row at Imola. Last year's race at the Italian circuit was cancelled due to heavy flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had no grip anymore. I was sliding a lot. I saw Lando closing in. The last 10 laps were flat out," said a relieved Verstappen, who had appeared set for another easy win but had to sweat ultimately for the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's difficult when the tyres were not working anymore and you have to go flat out. I couldn't afford to make too many mistakes. Luckily we didn't."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was third at the Italian team's atmospheric home track, 7.916 off the pace, for his fourth podium finish of the season and a home race to come in Monaco next weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory extended Verstappen's championship lead to 48 points, with Leclerc now his closest rival after Red Bull's Sergio Perez started 11th and finished only eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has 161 points, Leclerc 113 and Perez 107. Red Bull have 268 in the constructors' standings with Ferrari on 212 and McLaren on 154.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished fourth, after starting fifth due to a three-place grid penalty for impeding in qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fifth and the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell sixth and seventh on another afternoon to forget for the once-dominant team. (Reuters)

    Iran leader's helicopter crashes; fog hampers rescue

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ebrahim Raisi was reported to be onboard the helicopter that came down. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753814_1_20240519220926.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were struggling to reach the site of the incident.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were "at risk following the helicopter crash", which happened on the way back from a visit to the border with Azerbaijan in Iran's northwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State TV quoted an official as saying that at least one passenger and one crew member had been in contact with rescuers. It also said the helicopter had been found, though Iran's Red Crescent denied this report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian state media said bad weather was the cause of the crash and was complicating rescue efforts. The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all the resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guard to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is dark and it has started raining, but the search continues. Rescue teams have reached the area ... however, the rain has created mud, making the search difficult," a local reporter told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national broadcaster had earlier stopped all its regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country and, in a corner of the screen, live coverage of rescue teams deployed on foot in the mountainous area in heavy fog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rescue teams were expected to reach the probable site of the crash later on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neighbouring countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology to help Iran with the search.

    'Smaller Olympic presence will still be a success'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tony Choi, who heads the Hong Kong Sports Institute, says he hopes Hong Kong can win medals in every Olympic Games from now on. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753787_1_20240519161207.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.

 Police on Sunday said they have arrested two people on suspicion of vandalising a tombstone in Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to video circulating online, it belonged to Wong Ka-kui, the late singer of the now-disbanded musical band, Beyond.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video purportedly showed someone smashing the tombstone with a hammer, as well as spraying liquid and writing with a black marker on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the pair arrested are aged 15 and 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on social media, a former member of Beyond, Yip Sai-wing, called the incident "truly outrageous" and said anyone found guilty of carrying out the act must be punished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong died in 1993 at the age of 31.

 Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Qijiguang bore a banner reading "Bring peace and friendship to meet good friends" as it approached the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint training is the naval component of the ongoing Golden Dragon exercises, which are regularly held between the two countries. (AP & AFP)
