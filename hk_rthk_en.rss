<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday vowed to rebuild trust with European allies damaged by Brexit as he hosted dozens of leaders at a summit where they reaffirmed backing for Ukraine and pledged to tackle irregular migration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer, premier for two weeks, told more than 45 European leaders the UK would be a "friend and partner" as he started work to improve ties hit by the country's tortuous departure from the European Union under his Conservative predecessors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to work with all of you to reset relationships, rediscover our common interest and renew the bonds of trust and friendship that brighten the fabric of European Life," the 61-year-old Labour leader told them as he opened the European Political Community (EPC) meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe is grappling with challenges ranging from supporting Kyiv after Russia's full-scale assault to breaking up people-smuggling gangs contributing to record levels of irregular migration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the background hangs the increasing possibility of Donald Trump regaining the White House in November, with fears over his commitment to the Western military alliance Nato.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's newly elected running mate JD Vance is an outspoken critic of military aid to Ukraine and has pushed for negotiations with Russia to end the two-year-plus war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important to be here, for Ukraine, especially this tough period, for us during the war," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, west of London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us it's very important to maintain unity in Europe because always this unity leads to strong decisions," added Zelensky before discussions with Starmer and a meeting with head of state King Charles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While at the summit, the Ukrainian leader signed long-term security cooperation agreements with the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, attending an EPC summit for the first time, reaffirmed the alliance's support for Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a departure from the often fractious relations that characterised the run-up to Brexit, Starmer, who led Labour to a landslide election win over the Tories on July 4, told European counterparts that his government would be "a friend and a partner ready to work with you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called irregular migration a "crisis" affecting every country attending. More than 380,000 undocumented migrants crossed the EU's borders last year, and tens of thousands made their way to Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer called for a sharing of resources, intelligence and tactics to "shut down the smuggling routes and smash the gangs," behind migrant Channel crossings from northern France in small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a problem that dogged the Tory administrations under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cooperation was "the most efficient" way to tackle the problem, French President Emmanuel Macron said, the morning after one migrant died and 71 others were rescued off the French coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has conversations pencilled in with several European leaders, including Macron, as he fleshes out what he wants the new relationship with the EU to look like.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former human rights lawyer and chief state prosecutor supported Britain remaining in the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum and was once Labour's Brexit spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has ruled out rejoining the European single market, customs union or freedom of movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he does want to negotiate a new security pact with the bloc and a veterinary agreement to ease border checks on agricultural foods, as well as an improved trading deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer was quick out of the blocks to congratulate Ursula von der Leyen on securing another term as European Commission president. He eagerly anticipated "working closely" with the EU chief, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish Premier Simon Harris described Labour's reset with Europe as a "gamechanger" while European Council chief Charles Michel said he hoped that a "new chapter" would be opened with the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One high-ranking EU official said there were "good vibes" in the early contacts with the new Labour government, but warned that the EU was not looking to "reopen" the Brexit deal with Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blenheim Palace is the birthplace of Britain's World War II leader Winston Churchill. The Treaty of London, which signed into existence the Council of Europe in 1949, was on display, adding further symbolism to the proceedings. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Vieira stood down as manager of Strasbourg, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Thursday, as his name was linked to the vacant United States men's team coaching job.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vieira, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, joined Strasbourg last season and is leaving "by mutual agreement," the French club said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, 48, coached New York City in the MLS between 2016-2018 and, according to widespread reports, could be returning to the US to succeed Gregg Berhalter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berhalter was axed as United States coach following their first-round exit in the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira was asked about the States job last week after Strasbourg lost 4-0 to Turkish giants Fernebahce in a pre-season friendly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States? Ah no, my focus is 100% in Alsace (Strasbourg)" he told a local newspaper in the north eastern region of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, who was under contract with Strasbourg until 2026, ended last season with his club in 13th place in Ligue 1. (AFP)

    32 dead in Bangladesh unrest as state TV set ablaze

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Several cities across Bangladesh saw violence throughout the day. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762194_1_20240718235131.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladeshi students set fire to the country's state broadcaster on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on the network seeking to calm escalating clashes that have killed at least 32 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of protesters demanding reform of civil service hiring rules fought back and overwhelmed riot police who had fired at them with rubber bullets, chasing the retreating officers to BTV's headquarters in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incensed crowd then set ablaze the network's reception building and dozens of vehicles parked outside, a BTV official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broadcaster said "many people" were trapped inside as the fire spread but another official from the station later said that they had safely evacuated the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government has ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police step up efforts to bring the country's deteriorating law and order situation under control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier appeared on the broadcaster on Wednesday night to condemn the "murder" of protesters and vow that those responsible will be punished regardless of their political affiliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But violence worsened on the streets despite her appeal for calm as police again attempted to break up demonstrations with rubber bullets and tear gas volleys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 25 people were killed on Thursday in addition to seven killed earlier in the week, according to a tally of casualty figures from hospitals, with hundreds more wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police weaponry was the cause of at least two-thirds of those deaths, based on descriptions given by hospital figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've got seven dead here," said an official at Uttara Crescent Hospital in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first two were students with rubber bullet injuries. The other five had gunshot injuries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 1,000 others had been treated at the hospital for injuries sustained during clashes with police, the offical said, adding many had rubber bullet wounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Didar Malekin of the online news outlet Dhaka Times said that Mehedi Hasan, one of his reporters, had been killed while covering clashes in Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several cities across Bangladesh saw violence throughout the day as riot police marched on protesters who had begun another round of human blockades on roads and highways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helicopters rescued 60 police officers who were trapped on the roof of a campus building at Canadian University, the scene of some of Dhaka's fiercest clashes on Thursday, the elite Rapid Action Battalion police force said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have demanded an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits children of pro-government groups that back Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her administration is accused by rights groups of capturing state institutions and stamping out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mubashar Hasan, a Bangladesh expert at the University of Oslo in Norway, said the protests had grown into a wider expression of discontent with Hasina's autocratic rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are protesting against the repressive nature of the state," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Protesters are questioning Hasina's leadership, accusing her of clinging onto power by force," he added. "The students are in fact calling her a dictator."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladeshis reported widespread mobile internet outages around the country on Thursday, two days after internet providers cut off access to Facebook – the protest campaign's key organising platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Junior telecommunications minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak said that the government had ordered the network cut off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earlier told reporters that social media had been "weaponised as a tool to spread rumours, lies and disinformation," forcing the government to restrict access.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Along with police crackdowns, demonstrators and students allied to the premier's ruling Awami League have also battled each other on the streets with bricks and bamboo rods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's national address did not assign responsibility for the deaths, but descriptions from hospital authorities and students suggest at least some died when police used supposedly non-lethal weapons on demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rights group Amnesty International said video evidence from clashes this week showed that Bangladeshi security forces had used unlawful force. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Justin Thomas made a strong start at the 152nd Open but then hit trouble as rain squalls kept a grip on the early scoring at Royal Troon in Scotland on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Alex Noren was the early clubhouse leader with a birdie on the 18th giving him a two-under-par 69, but Thomas initially looked like eclipsing that mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former PGA Championship winner gathered four birdies with one bogey on his outward nine and then birdied the 10th to top the early leader board on four under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a double-bogey six at the 12th and a bogey on the 13th dropped him back into the pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow American Bryson DeChambeau, last month's US Open champion, started in the company of young Swede Ludvig Aberg, who is ranked fourth in the world, but the big-hitting DeChambeau suffered a terrible start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was five over after his first six holes and in danger of playing himself out of contention on day one. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they seized 31 kilos of suspected methamphetamine and five kilos of suspected cocaine in seven drug trafficking cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The haul had a market value of about HK$20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said for six of the cases, drug traffickers were trying to hide the suspected narcotics in co-working spaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said drug traffickers would ship packages declared as chairs and children's toys from the United States and send them to different shared office spaces in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, aged 38, suspected of receiving the shipment was arrested in Wong Chuk Hang on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, officers arrested a 23-year-old passenger from Kuala Lumpur at the airport on Wednesday. He was found carrying suspected methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two arrested men have both been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European lawmakers on Thursday re-elected Ursula von der Leyen to a second five-year term as president of the European Commission during their first parliamentary session since the June elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Von der Leyen won with the support of 401 MEPs in the 720-seat chamber -- comfortably over the 361-vote majority she needed to remain head of the EU's executive body. There were 284 who voted against in the secret ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was among the first world leaders to congratulate von der Leyen for securing another five-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said her re-election was "a clear sign of our ability to act in the European Union, especially in difficult times," Scholz wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among her biggest pledges was a plan to launch EU defence projects starting with a European air shield, a commitment not to weaken Europe's climate change policies, and more help for European industries struggling to compete with the US and China while they invest in curbing emissions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next European Commission would propose a new competitiveness fund in the next EU budget to invest in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also outlined changes on migration policy, including a new approach for the return of migrants, and plans to triple the number of European border and coast guards. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 High-quality development is China's priority in building a modern socialist country, and the nation must consciously place reform in a more prominent position, according to a communique issued on Thursday after a top-level meeting in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China’s Communist Party wrapped up the third plenary session of its 20th Central Committee, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The communique stated the need to deepen supply-side structural reform, improve incentive and constraint mechanisms for promoting high-quality development, and create new growth drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will improve the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions, for promoting full integration between the real economy and the digital economy, for developing the service sector, for modernising infrastructure, and for enhancing the resilience and security of industrial and supply chains," the communique stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to evaluate the implementation of the '14th Five-Year Plan' and work on the preliminary planning work of the '15th Five-Year Plan'."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be measures to prevent and defuse risks in key areas such as real estate, local government debt, and small and medium-sized financial institutions, according to the communique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy, while encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public economy, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plenum document also listed the overall objectives of further deepening reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By 2035, we will have finished building a high-standard socialist market economy in all respects, further improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, generally modernised our system and capacity for governance, and basically realised socialist modernisation," the communique said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will pave the way for building China into a great modern socialist country by the middle of the century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The communique added the reform tasks laid out in the resolution should be completed in 2029 when the People's Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party will resolutely safeguard national security and social stability, vigorously promote national defence and its military, continue to promote works focusing on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and push for diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, the communique said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the country's opening up, the document said the party will steadily expand institutional opening up, deepen the structural reform on foreign trade, further reform the management systems of investment, improve regional opening up, and refine the mechanisms for high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, the communique said the session decided to accept former foreign minister Qin Gang's resignation from the Central Committee, and confirmed the Politburo’s earlier decision to expel former defence minister Li Shangfu as well as Li Yuchao and Sun Jinming of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, from the party.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's representatives to the country's political bodies submitted their suggestions for the Policy Address to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday, focusing on patriotic education and economic development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the submission, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), Starry Lee, said it is the right time to put forward patriotic education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the right time to do so. First of all, our country [has] our own policy and legislation to govern that. Hong Kong, as part of the country, [we are obligated] to do that. We understand...it will further make 'One Country, Two Systems' a more effective system for our own country," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dennis Lam, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), urged the government to use Hong Kong's private healthcare services to attract mainlanders to the city, as more Hongkongers are seeking medical care on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bank of East Asia's Co-CEO Brian Li, who is a local delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the government should bolster the SAR's status as an offshore renminbi hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can strengthen our role as an offshore renminbi centre by gradually expanding the pool of offshore RMB funds and the scope of their applicability. We can also promote trading and fundraising in the stock market and the over-the-counter market, enhancing the international role of the RMB,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE is set to deliver his third Policy Address in October.

<div class="itemFullText">
 TSMC on Thursday said it expects third-quarter revenue to surge by as much as 34 percent from a year earlier after the world's largest contract chipmaker posted a quarterly net profit that beat market expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier for US tech giants Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards the adoption of AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC's April-June net profit climbed to T$247.8 billion (US$7.60 billion) from T$181.8 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The profit beat a T$238.8 billion forecast for the quarter which ended June 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said second-quarter revenue rose 33 percent year-on-year to US$20.8 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of between US$19.6 billion and US$20.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue for the current quarter is expected to be at least US$22.4 billion compared with US$17.3 billion in the same period last year. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said it called the police over an incident that led to disruption to Light Rail services in Yuen Long, saying it suspected a truck had hit and damaged overhead cables.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 47-year-old truck driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. He was held for investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said no injury was reported from the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail company said the incident happened at around 2pm, and the affected section was near the Shui Pin Wai Stop, next to Yuen Long Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm said services gradually returned to normal after around three hours, following emergency repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Light Rail routes, including 610, 614, 615, 671P and 751, had to be diverted. Free shuttle buses  were laid on for passengers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local NGO, Agency for Volunteer Service, on Thursday said more than 54 percent of those it surveyed had taken part in organised volunteer service over the last three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its survey of more than 770 people, conducted last month, showed about 40 percent of participants volunteered through a charity or NGO. Melissa Pang, chairwoman of the agency, said reaching out to organisations to indicate a willingness to volunteer was an important first step for those looking to do volunteer work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it is very important for them to get attached to an NGO or a school or other organisations who can provide more attractive scheme of volunteering. Sometimes they [the people looking to volunteer] might have the wish, 'oh I can spare an hour now to volunteer.' However, they might not find the appropriate work to do," Pang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey also found that the economic value of volunteer service in 2023 was the equivalent to almost HK$11 billion, double the amount in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Kwong, assistant professor at Heng Seng University, said that on a scale of five, with five being the happiest, people who volunteered were happier than those who didn't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added a new research indicator had been created that would analyse participants' interest and input in volunteering, as well as the impact it creates. The data collected would help reflect a realistic picture of Hong Kong's organised volunteering efforts.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year's Hong Kong Streetathon say participants will get a unique experience that engages all their senses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The day will include a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, as well as a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon", local delicacies will be dished out to runners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, organisers say, will satisfy the gustatory sense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There'll be music and fragrance diffusers in parts of the route for the auditory and olfactory senses, while the scenes of Victoria Harbour, various performances, and high fives from the sidelines will satisfy the visual and tactile senses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we aim to create the most meaningful marathon by bringing the first ever 'Five-senses Marathon' into the event to enhance the overall running experience," said Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of organiser RunOurCity Foundation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said this year's marathon not only promises a fun running experience, but is also partnered with 25 charities and NGOs to advocate for the seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will include a family event, the Asian YOUTHRUN 10K race, designed to encourage students to participate in long-distance running activities to promote physical fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will be held on December 8, with registration for the full and half marathon, and the 10K race beginning on July 25.

    Legco lowers compulsory land sales threshold

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Developers hoping to knock down old residential blocks might not have to work as hard to get flat owners to agree in future, under changes to the law approved by Legco on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At present, developers need the backing of at least 80 percent of owners to trigger a compulsory land sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new law, thresholds as low as 65 percent will apply, depending on the age of a building and its location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lowest percentage will apply to buildings across the city that are at least 70 years old, as well as any block older than 60 years in the designated areas of Wan Chai, Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, To Kwa Wan and Tsuen Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current 80 percent threshold will remain in place for buildings outside the designated areas that are between 50 and 60 years old, while developers will need to get the blessing of 70 percent of owners of blocks aged between 60 and 70 outside the designated areas, as well as those in buildings aged between 50 and 60 in the designated areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development minister Bernadette Linn brushed off calls by some lawmakers for the pace of redevelopments to be slowed down because of the sluggish economy and housing market, saying addressing the issue of ageing buildings is an urgent matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while sceptics may think the changes are to benefit developers, they are actually aimed at helping society at large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most important objective is to expedite redevelopment of old and debilitated buildings, to assist building owners in addressing the building hazards and improving the living environment for all," Linn said in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then, we learn from the media criticisms about our approach, and that only private developers benefit from this policy [amendment], but this is not true."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said her bureau and the Urban Renewal Authority will both set up dedicated offices to offer more support for homeowners affected by redevelopment plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said that if all goes smoothly, the new thresholds could come into effect by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most councillors spoke in support of the law changes. An amendment motion moved by Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen to keep the threshold at 80 percent in the designated areas was voted down.

    Watchdog apologises over Nongfu water row

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday apologised to mainland bottled water and beverages company Nongfu Spring after the firm threatened legal action over a report it condemned as erroneous and "massively damaging" to its reputation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an article in the watchdog's latest CHOICE magazine – which suggested people should stop buying bottled water altogether and make do with tap water – the council noted that every litre of Nongfu Spring's bottled water contains three microgrammes of the potential carcinogen bromate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that three microgrammes is the maximum amount permitted in mineral water under European Union regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, which also covered a number of other bottled water brands, prompted an angry response from Nongfu Spring, which complained that its product should not be categorised as mineral water but "natural drinking water".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's limit for bromate in drinking water is 10 microgrammes per litre, more than three times higher than the level permitted in mineral water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the council said it has reclassified the product in question as "natural drinking water" after holding a meeting with Nongfu Spring representatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also adjusted its rating of the product, from 4.5 stars to the maximum five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council reiterated that all 30 water products it tested in the study were found to be safe to drink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring also issued a statement noting that the council has found its product to be fully compliant with the relevant standards.

    West Kowloon arts hub plans to sell land in batches

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Betty Fung, on Thursday said land for residential developments at the arts hub site will be sold in two or three batches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fung said the authorities will work with private developers on land sales for homes, but not for hotels and offices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because as a blueprint for diversified property development, we think it is best to keep some properties to ourselves for rental income."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank, Ryan Ip, said private residential developments at the cultural district should incorporate art elements and have areas that are open to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Development Bureau has to act as a gatekeeper to make sure the whole project will not become a pure luxury residential project just like you can find anywhere in the city," Ip said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A project that can be seamlessly integrated within the West Kowloon Cultural District by, for example, adding in arts and culture elements in its design and also allowing the public to use some of the public open space within the residential projects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said the land parcels are in a prime location and could bring in HK$15 billion for the authority, which is currently losing around HK$700 million a year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A preliminary investigation into Wednesday's fire at a shopping centre in Sichuan province that killed 16 people indicated that it was caused by construction work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blaze started at around 6pm in the mall at the foot of a 14-storey building in the city of Zigong. It was put out more than two hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rescue operation lasted for hours into Thursday. Reports said dozens who had been trapped were plucked to safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage on social media showed thick black smoke rising from the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management and National Fire and Rescue Administration said they have dispatched a working team to Sichuan following the deadly fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fire experts from across the country will join the probe into the blaze. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has been arrested in Singapore on suspicion of drug trafficking, SAR police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said it had contacted counterparts in Singapore over suspicions that gangs in Hong Kong were sending people there to smuggle drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Singaporean officers arrested a 25-year-old man as he was allegedly handing over a box to a logistics company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR police said four kilogrammes of methamphetamine worth around HK$3 million was found inside two statues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was detained pending further investigation, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau said anyone found guilty of trafficking more than 250 grammes of methamphetamine can face the death penalty.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Argentina's Fernandez (right) during the 2024 Copa America final against Colombia. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762065_1_20240718084300.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into racist chants by Argentina players after they won the Copa America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "FIFA is aware of a video circulating on social media and the incident is being looked into," a spokesperson for world football's governing body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added: "FIFA strongly condemns any form of discrimination by anyone including players, fans and officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chants were heard during a live video posted on social media by Chelsea and Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez from the team bus in the wake of the Copa victory over Colombia in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some players, including 23-year-old Fernandez, sing a chant dating back to the 2022 World Cup final in which Argentina beat France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The song targets France's star striker Kylian Mbappe among others and includes racist and homophobic insults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea had earlier announced they had launched an internal disciplinary procedure against Fernandez over the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez has apologised and the club said in a statement it had launched an "internal disciplinary procedure".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chelsea Football Club finds all forms of discriminatory behaviour completely unacceptable," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We acknowledge and appreciate our player's public apology and will use this as an opportunity to educate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez, who joined Chelsea from Portugese club Benfica in 2023, said in his apology: "The song includes highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I stand against discrimination in all forms and apologise for getting caught up in the euphoria of our Copa America celebrations." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal and Casper Ruud saved a match point in the deciding set tie-break to reach the semi-finals of the doubles in Bastad on Wednesday, hours after the Norwegian was knocked out of the singles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadal and Ruud squeezed past France's Theo Arribage and Roman Safiullin of Russia 6-4, 3-6, 12-10 to advance to the last four, winning the final three points of the match after being on the brink of defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we had some fun. It was an emotional match at the end, a good level of tennis against two good players," said Nadal, who is also competing in the singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We enjoy it, the crowd was amazing. Full crowd in a doubles match, that's fantastic. Just enjoying every single day here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Nadal and Ruud wait to discover their semi-final opponents, the Spaniard will be back in action on Thursday against Britain's Cameron Norrie in the round of 16 in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion returned to competition for the first time this week since his early French Open exit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will hope to avoid the same fate as Ruud, whose Olympic preparations took a hit when he lost 6-3, 6-3 to Thiago Monteiro in the second round earlier on Wednesday. (AFP)

 Ecuador's Richard Carapaz won stage 17 of the Tour de France after the remnants of a breakaway finished ahead of the main pretenders in the High Alps on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  EF rider Carapaz dropped Simon Yates and soloed the final 10km to win his first ever Tour de France stage after finishing third overall in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Giro d'Italia champion, who won the Tokyo Olympics road race, also wore the overall leader's yellow jersey after his efforts in the second stage to Bologna.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall leader Tadej Pogacar, defending champion Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel kept their powder dry until late in the medium mountain run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio then produced an entertaining scrap with third-placed Evenepoel finishing 12sec ahead of Pogacar, with Vingegaard losing two seconds to the leader. (AFP)

    White House says Biden has tested positive for Covid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden attended a campaign event in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762052_1_20240718070954.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid during a campaign trip to Las Vegas on Wednesday and is suffering from mild symptoms, the White House said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I feel good," 81-year-old Biden said, giving reporters the thumbs up as he leaned out of his limousine dubbed "The Beast," before boarding Air Force One to head for isolation at his beach home in Rehoboth, Delaware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came minutes after the head of a Latino union said Biden had called to apologise that he could no longer address its members because he had been diagnosed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also comes as Biden is under growing pressure to drop his reelection bid against Donald Trump after a disastrous debate performance sparked concerns about his age and health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for Covid-19," spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's doctor said he was suffering from a runny nose and a "non-productive cough" along with "general malaise," the White House said in an accompanying note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was now receiving the Covid drug Paxlovid, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97 percent," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Janet Murguia, the president of the Unidos union, told the crowd about the diagnosis shortly before the White House announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was just on the phone with President Biden, and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The President has been at many events, as we all know, and he just tested positive for Covid. So of course, we understand that he needs to take the precautions that have been recommended." (AFP)

    Biden says may quit race if 'medical condition found'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said he could drop his reelection bid if doctors found he had a medical condition, as a top Democrat on Wednesday urged the 81-year-old to step aside.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's comments were the first time he has even slightly opened the door to abandoning the White House race, and came as Representative Adam Schiff, a key ally from California, urged Biden to "pass the torch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem,'" Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview recorded on Tuesday, when asked what could make him rethink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden however defended his decision to stay on for a rematch with Republican Donald Trump in November, and explained why he had not handed over to a younger generation after one term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said I was going to be a transitional candidate, and I thought I'd be able to move on from this, pass it on to someone else," he said. "But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been fighting for political survival since a disastrous debate against Trump nearly three weeks ago, in which his tired and confused appearance sparked concerns about his age.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff became the first Democrat to call for him to step aside since the assassination attempt against Trump on Saturday, which had briefly silenced the growing chorus against Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November," Schiff said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff, who is expected to win a Senate seat this November, is a key White House ally in the legislature and shot to nationwide prominence as lead prosecutor during then-president Trump's first impeachment trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden was set to make a fresh attempt to prop up his candidacy in a speech to crucial Latino voters in the battleground state of Nevada later on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 20 House Democrats and one senator have now called on Biden to leave the White House race but Biden has refused, insisting he is best placed to beat Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls show Biden trailing in a tight race, with Trump pulling ahead in key swing states but no dramatic movement since the debate debacle or shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said his mental acuity was "pretty damn good" in an NBC interview on Monday, one of a series of unscripted outings aimed at showing he has what it takes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With pressure on Biden mounting, Democrats said on Wednesday they plan a virtual nomination for the president in the first week of August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on August 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some Democrats have slammed the scheme, accusing the party of trying to ram through Biden's candidacy and avoid a full discussion of alternative choices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party chiefs say they need to carry out the virtual roll-call by August 7, which is the deadline set by the Republican-led state of Ohio for the submission of nominations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden otherwise risks not being on the ballot in Ohio, the home state of Trump's new running mate JD Vance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Ohio's governor has signed a law giving Biden more time, the DNC said it feared further legal challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "None of this will be rushed," the heads of the DNC's rules committee said in a letter to lawmakers. "No matter what may be reported, our goal is not to fast-track."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But several lawmakers are planning to sign a letter against the virtual nomination plan and others have criticised it, according to US media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden insists that Democratic voters support him, but a poll by the Associated Press and NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research said on Wednesday that nearly two-thirds want him to step aside. (AFP)

    Tech shares tumble as Dow ends at 3rd straight record

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Analysts on Wall Street say tech stocks have been overbought. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762040_1_20240718045151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished decisively lower on Wednesday after talk that tech equities are overbought, while the Dow pushed to a third straight record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts described the development as an inevitable cooling in large tech names including Facebook parent Meta and artificial intelligence player Nvidia, after outsized gains in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow, however, continued to benefit from an inflow of funds to underperforming names from other sectors. The blue-chip index finished up 0.6 percent at 41,198.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent to 5,588, while the Nasdaq slumped 2.8 percent to 17,996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen a relentless rally and a pause might be healthy at this point," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, we had some concerns around semiconductors and chip makers which have been under pressure. And that's been kind of adding to the rotation narrative."
  <br/>
  <br/>

    Deadly strikes pound Gaza as Israel PM vows no let-up

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel kept up its air strikes on Gaza on Wednesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to ramp up the pressure on Hamas as hopes faded for a US-announced ceasefire plan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh accused Israel of deliberately undermining negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal because it did not want to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said it had carried out 25 strikes in 24 hours, targeting "military structures, terrorist infrastructure, terrorist cells and rigged structures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, who has repeatedly vowed to eradicate Hamas, insisted on Tuesday that despite mounting pressure, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against the militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is exactly the time to increase the pressure even more, to bring home all the hostages – the living and the dead – and to achieve all the war objectives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He rammed home the point in a speech to parliament, saying: "We have got them by the throat; we are on the road to absolute victory."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said 52 people, most of them women and children, had been killed in Israeli strikes over the previous 24 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The territory's civil defence agency said 30 people had been killed in three strikes in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza – one on a UN-run school, another on a house and a third on a mosque.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Wednesday it reported 15 deaths across central and northern Gaza from Israeli action, while the health ministry reported three children and a woman killed near Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In southern Gaza, two people were killed in Israeli bombardment of the Shakush area, northwest of Rafah, a medical source at Nasser Hospital said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 90 percent of Gazans have been forced from their homes, many of them seeking refuge in UN-run schools. Seven of these schools have been hit by Israeli strikes since July 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 70 percent of UN-run schools across Gaza have been hit during more than nine months of fighting, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do they target us when we are innocent people?" asked Umm Mohammed al-Hasanat, sheltering with her family at a UN-run school in Nuseirat, which was among those hit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not carry weapons but are just sitting and trying to find safety for ourselves and our children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington has been pushing for a truce deal between Israel and Hamas since President Joe Biden released details of what he said was an Israeli ceasefire roadmap on May 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the efforts of Egyptian and Qatari mediators, indirect negotiations between the foes have made no headway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a telephone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan late on Tuesday, the Hamas leader blamed Israel for the deadlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We dealt positively with the proposals put to us by the mediators but the occupation is avoiding the required outcome and does not want to reach an agreement under which it ends its war," Haniyeh said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a senior Hamas official said on Sunday that the group was withdrawing from the current talks following Israel's deadly strikes but was ready to return if its attitude changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,794 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war has devastated the coastal territory and left Gazans suffering shortages of food, medicines and basic goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference on Wednesday, the World Health Organisation's representative in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, Rik Peeperkorn, said that only 16 aid trucks had entered the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom border crossing during the last month, while dozens of trucks were still waiting to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main crossing point for aid, Rafah, which connects Gaza with Egypt, has been closed for months since Israel sent ground troops into the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO also said that out of the territory's 36 hospitals, only 15 were partially functioning and that there had been more than a thousand attacks against health facilities in Gaza since October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the US military announced that its problem-plagued mission to deliver aid via a temporary pier had officially ended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice Admiral Brad Cooper told reporters the mission was "complete, so there's no more need to use the pier." (AFP)

    Top Democrat Adam Schiff calls on Biden to exit race

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Representative Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the most heavyweight Democrat so far to publicly urge US President Joe Biden to step aside for another candidate to face Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He called on his ally to "pass the torch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff, a key congressional powerbroker, praised Biden but told the Los Angeles Times that he doubts that the 81-year-old incumbent can defeat Trump – a threat to "the very foundation of our democracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Californian, who is expected to win a Senate seat this November, is one of the party's most influential members and a key ally in the legislature for the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He served as chairman of the House intelligence panel when Democrats had the majority in 2019 and shot to nationwide prominence as lead prosecutor during then-president Trump's first impeachment trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Schiff aired the worry gripping the party, although often in private, that questions over Biden's age and health will doom him in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those concerns rocketed after Biden performed badly in a televised debate with Trump last month, often looking confused or unable to articulate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Biden has repeatedly said he intends to stay in the race, arguing that he remains the best person to defeat Trump. Polls show a tight overall contest, but with Trump pulling ahead in key swing states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff called Biden "one of the most consequential presidents in our nation's history."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he also said "a second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the president can defeat Donald Trump in November."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden should "secure his legacy" by stepping aside, he added. (AFP)

    R&amp;A chief 'doesn't care' about Open prize money gap

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rory McIlroy bumps fists with a fan after a practice round ahead of the 152nd British Open Golf Championship at Royal Troon. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762031_1_20240718004735.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers has said he "doesn't care" that the British Open's prize fund is not among the top 25 in men's golf.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Royal & Ancient Golf Club announced minimal increases to prize money for the 152nd British Open this week amid "concern" about the impact on financial sustainability and the perception of men's golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner at Royal Troon on Sunday will receive £2.38 million (US$3.1 million), which is an increase of just US$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bryson DeChambeau earned US$4.3 million for winning last month's US Open, while Scottie Scheffler's Masters victory in April came with a US$3.6 million prize.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total British Open prize fund of US$17 million is up by just US$500,000 on last year and stands as less than the other three majors, 12 PGA Tour events and all 14 Liv Golf events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A, I didn't know, and B, I don't care," said Slumbers, who is set to step down from his role in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we will always offer a very competitive prize fund for the Open, our wider focus is on increasing participation and improving pathways in golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to make choices about how we allocate resources and make the resources we have go as far as they can. Our responsibility is to ensure the game is thriving 50 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about being a lone voice. Sometimes leadership is lonely."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 158 players, rather than the usual 156, will contest this year's British Open after more past champions than expected opted to play at Royal Troon, with 18 players from Liv Golf in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But while USGA chief executive Mike Whan said last month he is serious about creating a formal pathway for Liv players into the US Open, Slumbers suggested that was not necessary for the British Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We decided after last year's event that we wanted to ensure that there was sufficient enough opportunities for all players, whichever tour they're playing on, to get into the Open," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used our Open Qualifying Series. We picked events that were available for all players. We used the Asian Tour and we used final qualifying to create those opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will that evolve in the coming years? I think that depends on how the game evolves. But we will continue to want the best players in the world to be able to get into the Open in an appropriate way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for future venues, Slumbers said that the Open was "absolutely" going to return to Muirfield for the first time since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The possibility of staging the Open outside the UK for the first time also remains on the agenda, with Portmarnock having asked the Irish government for support in putting forward a case to stage the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are fully supportive of the club doing that and we are actively engaged in making those assessments," Slumbers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But no decisions have been made because we don't even know if it's possible." (AFP)

 At least eight people have been killed in a fire that swept through a shopping mall in Sichuan province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  75 others were rescued from the blaze in the city of Zigong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eight people have been killed at the moment. The rescue teams are continuing search and rescue," CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage shown by the broadcaster and shared on social media showed thick black smoke rising from a building in Zigong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire started in the early evening in the shopping centre at the foot of the 14-storey building. CCTV said it was put out by 8.20pm, but rescue efforts were continuing late into the night. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lands Department on Wednesday announced the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Hung Kai Properties beat 10 other bidders and won the tender for a site in Siu Lek Yuen, Sha Tin, for HK$619 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site is expected to generate around 280 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the only residential plot on offer in the April-June quarter under the government land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Victor Lui, said the company will build small and medium-sized units there, with a total investment of around HK$2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kathy Lee, head of research at Colliers, said the government's first successful sale of residential land after scrapping property-cooling measures in February sent a positive message to the market, amid concerns that developers were reluctant to bid for land.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All qualified swimmers will be allowed to participate in the long course championships held by the Hong Kong China Swimming Association in November, regardless of their affiliated club's membership status.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This emerged from a meeting on Wednesday held by the association, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, as well as former SAR team swimmer Alex Fong and other representatives, after a nine-year-old swimmer from Fong's club was barred from competing due to its low ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the meeting, president of the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, Ronnie Wong, said the body is looking to reform their membership and appeal mechanisms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The swimming association will use a scoring system to determine club membership, regularly assessing how well the club is doing in different areas such as organising events, promoting swimming in district level, training swimmers and top athletes, and the number of top athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They will also set up a system for moving up or down in rank. Clubs that perform well can be upgraded and those that fail to meet standards may be downgraded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that suggestions put forth by Fong and New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho, which include increasing transparency in the three-tier membership system and revision of the composition of the swimming association's executive committee, will be discussed in a later executive committee meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Fok, sports sector lawmaker and vice president of the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, described the meeting as positive, adding that all parties reached a consensus to improve the sport of swimming in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that he hopes the controversy could come to an end and people can focus on supporting the SAR team in the upcoming Olympic Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong, with the government hoping it could help resolve an acute shortage of nurses in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials project that in 2030, Hong Kong will see a general nurse shortage of 8,700, with the number falling to 6,000 in 2040.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legal amendment introduces a new pathway allowing non-locally trained nurses to work in the SAR through special registration, without the need to pass local licensing exams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is subject to them having worked full-time for five years at specified institutions, and that their employers confirm they were satisfied with their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another pathway, there will also be limited registration or enrolment for the admission of non-locally trained nurses to serve in premises such as care homes, social welfare service units and nurse training schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current amendments to the Nurses Registration Ordinance do not seek to change the role of locally-trained healthcare professionals as the backbone of our healthcare system," health minister Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers before the passage of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Admitting non-locally trained nurses is an effective measure to address the local nurse shortage in the short term, so that Hong Kong's shortfall of healthcare professionals does not undermine the quality of healthcare and care home services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many lawmakers spoke in support of the bill, but they also expressed concern the new arrivals would need training and would need to overcome language barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said while bringing in non-locally trained nurses could ease the pressure of overburdened staff, he said he thinks it's not just a matter of "adding up the numbers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government needs to ensure service quality and that there would be sufficient supervision, especially at care homes.

    Exco conditionally approves arts hub funding plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kevin Yeung (right) says the funding plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least 10 years. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761981_1_20240717170517.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council has conditionally agreed to a funding proposal to allow the cash-strapped West Kowloon arts hub to sell some of its land parcels to ease a financial shortfall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority will be allowed to sell residential developments within Zone 2 of the site and keep all proceeds received from tenders to private developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means the development of residential blocks in the zone will no longer be restricted by the “Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) only" model adopted since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Culture minister Kevin Yeung on Wednesday said the plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, with very great effort of the authority, the BOT tender did not seem to meet with the appetites of the contractors or developers in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Instead of having a constant stream of income in the many years in future, we are now cashing in for a lump sum upfront, which could help release the financial challenges or the requirement at present."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority will have to meet certain requirements, including a triennial cap on operating deficits and a cap on the percentage of staff costs in relation to the total annual operating expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body's chairman, Henry Tang, said they can now avoid "drastic" cost-cutting measures such as reducing the number of days each week that the M+ museum is open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added that the authority will come up with ways to boost income without adding to the strain on the public coffers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to operate as we have always done under a discipline that we only spend what we need to spend and we will control our costs diligently and very seriously," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are ways that I can make more revenue without disrupting the operations of the museums and I will look for ways to do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the funding arrangement and its financial woes, DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng said the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority should explore more sources of income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority or the CSTB (Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) has to do more to make this hub an international culture arts hub," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this moment, we don't see they have a lot of different kinds of income, no matter the ticketing, renting the places... We do think there're a lot of different opportunities. So we hope that the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority do explore more different kinds of income strategies."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Bangladesh urged all universities to close on Wednesday, the day after at least six people died in violent protests over the allocation of government jobs and police raided the headquarters of the main opposition party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dhaka University, at the centre of the violence, decided to suspend classes and close its dormitories indefinitely, a university official told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University Grants Commission asked all public and private universities to close until further notice, in order to protect students, but the request did not have legal force and it was not immediately clear how many universities would comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said at least six people were killed on Tuesday in violence across the country as student protesters clashed with pro-government student activists and with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence was reported around the capital, Dhaka, the southeastern city of Chattogram and the northern city of Rangpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Dhaka police raided the headquarters of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, accusing it of playing a role in the violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Asian nation has been rocked by protests for weeks over public sector job quotas, which include a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence from Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has sparked anger among students who face high youth unemployment rates, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people. (Agencies)

    Take advantage of 'panda economy': DAB

<img alt="Regina Ip (centre) says the government should set up a joint-immigration checkpoint at Hong Kong International Airport." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761972_2_20240717160539.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB urged the government to make good use of the two incoming pandas as a means to promote the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as the party submitted its Policy Address recommendations to Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, DAB lawmaker Holden Chow said the “panda economy” could benefit the tourism, catering, and cultural sectors in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We very much look forward to these pandas coming to Hong Kong, and that would definitely boost our tourism," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the chief executive [in his Policy Address] would very much focus on the economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the New People's Party (NPP) said the government should set up a joint-immigration checkpoint at Hong Kong International Airport, to strengthen the SAR's status as an aviation hub by improving connectivity with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after submitting the NPP's Policy Address recommendations, the party’s chairwoman Regina Ip said co-location checkpoints are popular as they make travel to the mainland easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Co-location is nothing new. We already have co-location at the Shenzhen Bay control point and there will be more co-location facilities in the Greater Bay Area, and it's very popular with the visitors and with the travellers. So I don't think it will raise any legal problems. Of course, suitable legal amendments will need to be made,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the government should look at ways to attract locals and mainlanders to stay in Hong Kong over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council, Tien said many Hongkongers are travelling north because the cost of living in the city is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whatever you buy in Hong Kong is more expensive than you can get for the same thing in Shenzhen. That's why a lot of Hong Kong people no longer spend their weekends in Hong Kong. So how do we tackle that? We suggest that we need to go high-end, to move up the market," he said.

    Govt asks CLP to speed up lightning rod installation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tse Chin-wan said he hopes CLP can install 500 lightning rods at power supply facilities in two years." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761957_1_20240717150415.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he has urged power company CLP to speed up the installation of more lightning rods, as part of efforts to avoid power outages caused by extreme weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response to a question in the legislature, the minister said the company reported 26 "significant" outages in the past three years, 10 of which were caused by external factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said he met CLP's senior management on Tuesday to discuss recent blackouts and stopping bad weather affecting the power supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He cited the power company as saying it plans to install another 100 rods in two years at facilities such as transmission towers, but said he asked them to do 500 instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The plans are not taken forward fast enough. They're expecting in two years' time they can install 100 more such [devices], but I think this is a bit too slow," Tse told lawmakers at a council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker William Wong asked officials to lay more underground cables, so there would be less external disruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said in response that this has been the practice in new towns, but CLP still has lots of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that the power company has told him that in the event of outages, it would deploy more manpower to help residents, as well as using mobile power supply vehicles.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Book Fair opened on Wednesday, attracting scores of visitors and book lovers to the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Abby Johnson, who teaches at TWGHs Tsoi Wing Sing Primary School, said she was hoping to buy authentic literature books for her students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secretly, I'm hoping to find some books for myself too as well later on," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student Jaccari said the fair offers better prices than book stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Book Fair usually secures a better deal, compared to maybe walking around in book stores, especially the chained ones which are more expensive," Jaccari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raistlin Lau, under secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, emphasised the importance of the fair in an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The publishing and printing industry is one of Hong Kong's important creative industries, and the Book Fair is an essential part of promoting industrial development," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as single-entry tickets which cost HK$30 for adults and HK$10 for children, visitors to the fair can also buy a super pass for HK$88 to enjoy unlimited entry to the week-long event, which ends on Tuesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Wednesday said Hong Kong should make good use of its common law jurisdiction, particularly when it comes to taking advantage of the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam participated in the 16th antechamber meeting, which focused on the Belt and Road Initiative. This monthly informal gathering brings together government officials and lawmakers from the Legislative Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Lam said Hong Kong needs to leverage its strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The central people's government takes the view that Hong Kong in future should focus on firstly enhancing Hong Kong's role as a platform for providing professional services, including, for example, to serve as an international legal service centre,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And secondly, to promote financial services and to enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre in particular in the area of green finance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same occasion, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said authorities were actively working towards strengthening cooperation with Belt and Road countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the Belt and Road Office is organising all these activities in coordination with the central government for organising visits to the Belt and Road countries, checking the enterprises and the professional services, going abroad and meeting different sectors so as to promote Hong Kong and our advantages,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted the government was also working towards joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a wide-ranging free trade agreement.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC announced that Georges Elhedery will become the new group CEO. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761942_1_20240717132925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC on Wednesday named chief financial officer Georges Elhedery as the bank's next chief executive to drive "the next phase of development and growth".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to confirm Georges as the next HSBC Group Chief Executive," group chairman Mark Tucker said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board concluded that Georges was the outstanding candidate and we look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery will take over on September 2 from current CEO Noel Quinn, who announced his retirement in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and previously held the role of Co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets before being appointed chief financial officer in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanon-born, French-educated banker also led the bank's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkey region from July 2016 to February 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before assuming the role of CFO in 2023, Elhedery had a six-month sabbatical that included spending time learning Mandarin, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery has a "track record of leading through change, driving growth, delivering simplification, containing costs and brings a strong focus on execution," Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery said he was "deeply honoured" by HSBC's trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory," he said in the filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC said it would announce the next chief financial officer in due course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn would work with Elhedery to ensure a "smooth and orderly" handover before stepping down, the bank added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn, 62, oversaw a transformation of the London-headquartered lender and saw record profits during almost five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under him, the bank accelerated a years-long pivot to Asia -- where it generates most of its revenue -- vowing to develop its wealth business and target fast-growing markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank concluded the sales of its Canadian operations and its retail bank operations in France. It will also sell its Argentina division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn last year led the effort to repel a bid by major shareholder Ping An to spin off its Asia assets, with the proposal eventually voted down by shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The break-up bid highlighted HSBC's precarious position amid US-China tensions, with some observers questioning whether Europe's largest lender can continue to straddle East and West. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi on Wednesday said the new citizenship and social development (C&S) subject that replaced liberal studies in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education exams didn't make it any easier for students to achieve better scores overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some 94 percent of all candidates passed the new subject, which has either a pass or fail result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the C&S subject, I think we have a standard criteria and reference for assessment. So the result doesn't mean it's easier than before and it is not comparable because it is a newly adapted curriculum,” she told reporters after giving a speech to students at a school in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So I think we appreciate very much the effort from teachers and also from the students that they achieved their good scores.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she is pleased to see that students’ performance across all core and elective subjects improved overall, compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 17,600, or 43 percent of daytime secondary school pupils got the grades needed for a publicly-funded university place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Ariel Lau, from Jockey Club Ti-I College, said she wants to study English at either Chinese University or City University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was out of my expectations to pass all my core subjects. I had so much anxiety. I couldn't sleep last night and it was very troubling for me. I'm very conflicted right now on what to choose because before I thought I might have to take the associate degree. But now that I've got 5** in English, I think I might have the upper hand in choosing between the two programmes,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students with physical disabilities also accomplished great results. One pupil with cerebral palsy at Hong Kong Red Cross Princess Alexandra School got a 5** in business, accounting and financial studies. He said his biggest obstacle to studying was not being able to move around easily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I can't sit for a long period of time, or else my legs will feel tense. My writing speed is also a bit slower than a normal person. I need to stretch and relax my muscles frequently during my studies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, 10 students from eight schools achieved top marks across six subjects, up from four last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from La Salle College. One said he is going to Imperial College London to study economics, finance and data science, while another said he plans to stay in Hong Kong and study at Chinese University's medical school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe it's because a family member of mine became sick when I was young. I think a doctor doesn't just provide good treatment for patients but also provides mental support. Now that I have this chance, I would also like to provide mental support for my future patients," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from St. Paul's Co-educational College. One plans to study medicine in the SAR and the other economics in the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It means a lot to me because I grew up in a grassroot family. I know the struggles, I know what it feels like to struggle about your daily necessities… and by studying economics, I learn about government policies, social welfare and I can utilise my knowledge to say, not necessarily assisting the government, but maybe reflecting the needs of minorities to the government,” the second student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong Chinese Women's Club College produced a top scorer for the first time ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very excited! Looking at the past records, more top scorers came from elite schools. I never expected myself to be one of them. I am really thankful to every teacher in the school. I hope I can encourage other students to fight hard for their dreams," the student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other top students came from St. Joseph's College, King's College, Ying Wa Girls' School, Diocesan Boys' School and Pui Ching Middle School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, around 49,000 students received their DSE results on Wednesday.

 Boston's Jarren Duran, the All-Star MVP, hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning as the American League beat the National League 5-3 on Tuesday night for its 10th win in the past 11 All-Star Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes pitched a hitless first for the NL, twice hitting 100mph, and Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer in the third for a 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Juan Soto hit a two-run double and scored on David Fry's single to tie the score in the third, and Duran went deep off Cincinnati's Hunter Greene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duran is the fifth Boston player to be an All-Star MVP, the first since J.D. Drew in 2008. The others were Pedro Martinez in 1999, Roger Clemens in 1986 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. (AP)

    Thai police suspect poison killed 6 people in hotel

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand on Wednesday were investigating the deaths of six people in a luxury hotel in downtown Bangkok, with police saying their demise may have been caused by poisoning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lt. Gen. Trairong Piwpan, chief of the Thai police force's forensic division, said there were traces of cyanide in the cups and thermoses that police found in the room, but initial results of an autopsy were expected on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangkok police chief Lt. Gen. Thiti Sangsawang identified the dead as two Vietnamese Americans and four Vietnamese nationals, and said there were three males and three females.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A husband and wife among the dead had invested money with two of the other victims, suggesting that money could be a motive, according to officials, citing information obtained from relatives of the victims. The investment was meant to build a hospital in Japan and the group might have been meeting to settle the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victims had booked several rooms at the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel under seven names, and some were staying on a different floor from the room where they were found dead, according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were still looking for the seventh person included in the booking, Thiti said at a news conference at the hotel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there were no signs of a struggle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The residents of the room where the bodies were found were supposed to have checked out earlier Tuesday and their luggage had already been packed, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were discovered by a maid who went to the room after they failed to check out and found it locked from the inside, Thiti added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was food that had been ordered earlier from room service that was left uneaten, but drinks had been consumed, Thiti also said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He would not confirm a cause of death, but said the deaths appeared to have occurred about 24 hours before police arrived on the scene Tuesday evening after being called by hotel staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin went to the hotel later on Tuesday evening, and afterwards told journalists the incident was neither a robbery nor a random assault, and that it should not affect Thailand’s tourism industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pending the results of autopsies, “Our hypothesis is that they ingested something that killed them,” Srettha said. (AP)

    Elon Musk to move Space X HQ to Texas

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Musk says he will move the company's HQ from California due to the state's stance on gender issues. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761901_1_20240717093702.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk on Tuesday said he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas after a California law blocked schools from forcing teachers to notify parents about changes to a student's gender identity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is the final straw," Musk said on X a day after California governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill that fired up the already fraught culture wars in a tumultuous US election year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas," Musk said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The multi-billionaire also said that he is transferring X, formerly Twitter, from its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco to Austin, a threat he has made before but never saw to completion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building," Musk wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has already moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, but still maintains an "engineering headquarters" in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tycoon has expressed deep disdain for the use of preferred pronouns, often mocking the practice on social media and dismissing it as part of a "woke" agenda that was dangerous for society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk is the father of a trans daughter from whom he is estranged, and he blames her California private school education for making her politically far left and turning her against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom on Monday enacted the law after a contentious legislative process that pitted a handful of school boards fighting for parental rights against LGBTQ activists concerned about the welfare of vulnerable students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law reversed decisions in conservative school districts that ordered teachers to notify parents if a student changed their name or pronouns, or requested to use facilities or participate in programs that didn't match their official gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom, who is seen as a potential alternative to President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate for the White House, has often exchanged fire with conservatives over gender issues at state schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, he signed a law that sets fines for school districts that ban textbooks portraying LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom also fought bitterly with a conservative school board over its opposition to the study of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a San Francisco public official who was assassinated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has previously sparred with Newsom, who is a former San Francisco mayor, during the deadliest stages of the Covid-19 pandemic when he challenged the decisions of city and state health officials. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to another record on Tuesday on bullish reaction to positive earnings reports amid optimism over the rising likelihood of US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blue-chip index piled on 1.9 percent or more than 740 points to finish at 40,954.48, posting a second straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,667.20, also a record, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent to 18,509.34.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The records were driven partly by outsized gains for Bank of America and Dow member UnitedHealth Group following earnings reports, as well as an ongoing rotation of funds towards smaller companies that have underperformed in 2024 but are expected to be boosted by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides UnitedHealth, the Dow's biggest gainers included industrial giants Boeing and Caterpillar. (AFP)

    Five killed in Bangladesh job quota protests

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Near-daily marches this month in Bangladesh have demanded an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761860_1_20240716223004.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least five demonstrators were killed in Bangladesh on Tuesday during violent clashes between rival student groups over quotas for coveted government jobs, police said, a day after more than 400 others were injured.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as university students battled with counter-protesters backing the ruling Awami League party, fighting with sticks and hurling rocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence marks an escalation in efforts to hinder a determined weekslong campaign of sit-in protests and street marches that has ignored calls by Bangladesh's prime minister and top court for students to return to class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three people were killed in the port city of Chittagong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All three had bullet injuries," Chittagong Medical College Hospital director Mohammad Taslim Uddin said, adding that "some 35 people were injured".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rival student groups marched in several key locations around the capital Dhaka, some throwing bricks at each other, with traffic in the city of 20 million almost ground to a halt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the day wore on and with some key highways blocked by the protesters, the authorities deployed the paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) force in five major cities including Dhaka and Chittagong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had been tasked with controlling "the law and order situation in view of the quota protests", a BGB spokesman said.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal swept past Leo Borg, son of tennis great Bjorn Borg, to advance to the second round of the Bastad Open on Tuesday as he builds towards the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was Nadal's first singles match since the 38-year-old fell in the opening round at Roland Garros on May 27, and he eased to a 6-3, 6-4 win in wet conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Nadal and the 21-year-old Borg, currently ranked 461st in the world, were wild card entries to the Swedish clay-court tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an early scare with the former world number one slipping on the wet white line, Nadal broke for 3-1, hitting four aces to take the first set in 43 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An immediate break gave the Spaniard a foothold in the second, sealing the match on his second match point after 1hr 25min on court for his eighth ATP tour match win this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's good, I'm finally defending my title," joked Nadal, who has not played in Bastad since winning the title aged 19 in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't been playing a lot of tennis in the last few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even in the tougher moments, I have been able to keep going with the help of the team, but of course the fans have a huge impact on that. They give me amazing energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam winner praised his rival, the son of the long-retired former world number one Bjorn Borg, now 68.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a huge honour to play against the son of one of the biggest legends in the history of our sport," said Nadal. "I think he played quite well, he has a great future in front. I wish him all the very best." (AFP)

    Real Madrid officially unveil Kylian Mbappé

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé finally put on a Real Madrid jersey on Tuesday, fulfilling his childhood dream in front of a packed Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 80,000 fans were in hand at the Bernabeu to welcome the 25-year-old France star during his official presentation as the club's newest player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After signing his five-year contract with the Spanish powerhouse alongside club president Florentino Pérez, Mbappé entered the stage set up at the Bernabeu to loud cheers by the Madrid fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wearing the No. 9 jersey, Mbappé smiled broadly and waved to the fans who chanted his name, then embraced Pérez and former Madrid player and coach Zinedine Zidane, who invited Mbappé to visit the Spanish club for the first time when he was just a teenager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's an incredible day for me," Mbappé told the crowd, in good Spanish. ”Since being a kid I dreamed about playing for Madrid and today I'm here. It means a lot to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé finished his speech by asking the crowd to join him and chant “Hala Madrid,” similar to what his childhood idol – and “now friend” – Cristiano Ronaldo did when he arrived at the club. Mbappé then kissed the club’s shield and went around the Bernabeu kicking balls to the crowd in the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now I have another dream, which is to live up to the history of this club, the best club in the world,” he said. “I’ll give my life to this club and to this shield.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record 15 European Cups won by Madrid were on display on the stage where Mbappé was introduced. His relatives, club officials and several former players were also by the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I see my family happy, I see my mother crying,” said Mbappé, who earlier Tuesday underwent his physical with Madrid's doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The message “Welcome, Mbappé” was shown on the large video boards at the newly revamped Bernabeu, which had its roof closed for the midday ceremony in the Spanish capital. (AP)

    China voices support for Palestinian factions meeting

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed willingness to facilitate "reconciliation" between rival Palestinian factions, after Fatah said its officials would meet in Beijing with Hamas counterparts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas later said it would be attending talks in the Chinese capital at what it called an "expanded factional meeting" this weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement responded with a positive spirit and national responsibility," official Hossam Badran said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas was "keen on achieving national unity worthy of our Palestinian people... especially in light of the Al-Aqsa Flood battle," he added, using the militant group's name for its October 7 attack on Israel that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Beijing had "always supported all sides in Palestine to achieve reconciliation and unity through dialogue and negotiation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, he said, was "willing to develop dialogue and reconciliation, provide a platform and create opportunities for all sides on the Palestine issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to strengthen communication with all parties and work hard to realise the aim of Palestine's domestic reconciliation," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two Palestinian groups have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas' resounding victory in a 2006 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several reconciliation bids have failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank, where Fatah is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal leaves following the weekly cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761868_1_20240717041226.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's government, which will now serve only in a caretaker capacity, the presidency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French politics have been in gridlock since an inconclusive snap election earlier this month, with parties in the National Assembly scrambling to put together a governing coalition and no successor to Attal in sight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Tuesday, Attal said he would propose meetings with competing political groups "to move towards an action pact" on forming a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he ruled out any prospect of staying on himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do not aspire to be the next prime minister. I will not be the next prime minister," the outgoing premier told the broadcaster TFI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attal and his team would "handle day-to-day business until a new government is named", the Elysee Palace said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this period to come to an end as quickly as possible, it is up to republican forces to work together to build unity," it added, referring to mainstream political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron had announced the plan earlier in the day at the government's first cabinet meeting since his allies were roundly beaten earlier this month in a snap parliamentary election he had called to "clarify" the political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron told the ministers he would ask Attal to stay on "for some weeks", probably until after the Paris Olympics, which open on July 26, meeting participants said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This gives political parties more time to build a governing coalition after the July 7 election runoff left the lower house without an overall majority grouping. (AFP)

    US retail sales flat in June as consumption cools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the US Department of Commerce. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761856_1_20240716215636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States slipped less than analysts anticipated in June on a weaker performance in the auto and gas segments, government data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slower consumption growth adds to recent data showing that the world's biggest economy is cooling gradually – a trend likely to raise the central bank's confidence that it can soon begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To ease demand and bring inflation back down sustainably, the Federal Reserve has rapidly lifted the benchmark lending rate and in recent months, held it at a decades-high level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the Department of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, May's increase was revised slightly higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, the rise in June was 2.3 percent, a cooldown from the prior month as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long been expecting consumers to pull back as higher interest rates bite, lifting borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that consumption growth will, if anything, slow further in [the second half this year], as high interest rates continue to weigh on demand and the labour market takes a further turn for the worse," said Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among sectors, sales at auto dealers dropped 2.3 percent from May, while those at gas stations dropped three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But excluding auto and gas, total retail sales was up 0.8 percent in June – indicating that there may still be some way to go yet in easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales at restaurants and bars was up 0.3 percent from a month prior, the Commerce Department report showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is set to make its next rate decision at the end of July, and analysts widely expect the central bank to begin lowering rates in September. (AFP)

    IMF maintains 2024 global growth forecast

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The IMF held its global growth expectations for 2024 steady in a report on Tuesday even as it cut forecasts for the United States and Japan, while warning of inflation risks and trade tensions ahead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, unchanged from its April forecast, according to its World Economic Outlook update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia, particularly in the technology sector," said the fund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For 2025, it expects global growth of 3.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even as many countries saw better growth than anticipated in the first three months this year, the IMF flagged what it called notable surprises in Japan and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington-based lender also cautioned that upside risks to inflation have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated for longer, "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An area of concern is trade and industrial policy, with countries potentially adopting measures that impact the global economy's integration, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if risk assessments have shifted after the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's nominee in November's election, Gourinchas noted the fund will consider its implications. (AFP)

 Hong Kong passport holders can now stay in Thailand visa-free for a maximum of 60 days, up from 30, the Immigration Department announced on Tuesday.

  A department spokesperson said in a statement that the two places have a close relationship in people-to-people and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the Belt and Road Initiative, this extension of the period of visa-free entry will bring greater travel convenience to holders of HKSAR passports and strengthen the tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, 172 countries and territories have granted visa-free access, or provide visa-on-arrival services, to Hong Kong passport holders.

    Gareth Southgate resigns as England manager

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After eight years, four major tournaments and two finals, Gareth Southgate announced he was stepping down as England manager on Tuesday, saying it was “time for change.”
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunday’s 2-1 loss to Spain in the European Championship final proved to be his last game in charge of the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As a proud Englishman, it has been the honor of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,” he said. “But it’s time for change, and for a new chapter.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate’s contract was due to expire this year and his announcement comes after months of uncertainty surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Oyarzabal’s 86th-minute winner in Berlin was a painful way to end his reign after he transformed the fortunes of England’s underperforming national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hired in 2016, he led England to back-to-back finals at the Euros and to the semifinals of the World Cup in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, ultimately, he was unable to end the nation’s decades-long wait for a first major trophy since the World Cup in 1966. (AP)

 Researchers at Chinese University on Tuesday said they have developed a ladder system to help children with fish allergies reintroduce the food into their diet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The researchers said that between 2016 and 2021, they studied 249 children with fish allergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were found to be allergic to the protein β-parvalbumin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said some types of dark fish, such as salmon and tuna, have lower levels of the protein in them compared to fresh fish, such as tilapia and catfish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Agnes Leung, said she hopes the ladder system can help children with allergies eat some kinds of fish, because the food has nutrients that can't be found elsewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fish has very unique nutritional properties, for example, Omega 3 fatty acids are unique to fish, they help a growing child's brain development," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said they found that around 30 percent of the children in the study were not allergic to shellfish, such as shrimp and crab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major allergen in fish is parvalbumin, but the major allergen in shellfish is tropomyosin, so they are fundamentally different," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For a lot of fish-allergic patients, they could in fact tolerate shellfish without developing allergic reactions."

 Thirty Hong Kong secondary school students will attend a young astronaut training camp on the mainland later this month, to get a taste of the country's space programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their nine-day trip includes stops in Beijing, as well as space facilities in Jiuquan, Gansu province, and Wenchang in Hainan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Space Museum said it's the first time the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre will open to a Hong Kong delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students will get to put on spacesuits, make and fly rocket models and may get to meet real-life astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the students were picked from a pool of 200 applicants, who were nominated by their schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Form two student Law Shun-yan is among those heading to the mainland and said he's very interested in the country's space development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud of China's space development. I want to become a space scientist or even an astronaut," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope to share what I experience in Jiuquan and Wenchang with others in Hong Kong, so that they get to know more about space, so we can study in this field together in future and contribute to our motherland's aerospace industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony before the students headed off, Chief Secretary Eric Chan described the students as new blood for the SAR's integration into the country's development plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an international innovation and technological centre, Hong Kong surely has its responsibility to contribute what we can to the country's space missions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan thanked mainland authorities and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the camp, for their support.

 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) says companies in the SAR should look for investment opportunities in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edmund Lo, an economist at HKTDC, on Tuesday said investors should look out for green investments in Vietnam as this aligns with national policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another economist at the council, Henry Cheung, said Laos is looking for infrastructure investments to develop logistics, while Cambodia has several focuses ranging from digital infrastructure to being a logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irina Fan, director of research at HKTDC, said investors should look at both demand and national policies when determining business trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most important thing is to look for trade activities because when the trade activity moves up to a certain level, it will trigger investment activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) would also like to diversify from what they are doing, so this is a time where they would need investment support, they would need solution support."
