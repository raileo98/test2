<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid withstood a Borussia Dortmund barrage to win the Champions League for the 15th time as Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Junior struck late in a 2-0 win at Wembley on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Right-back Carvajal headed in from Toni Kroos' corner on 74 minutes before Vinicius fired into the far corner to extend the Spanish giants' record as the most successful club in Champions League history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid have now won their last nine European Cup finals and won the competition six times in the last 11 seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, not for the first time in that run, they had to rely on some good fortune as underdogs Dortmund were left to bitterly regret not making the most of their first-half chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Niclas Fuellkrug hit the post and Karim Adeyemi failed to convert a one-on-one with Thibaut Courtois.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid, though, always seem to find a way in Europe's elite competition and made more history in the English capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carvajal, Kroos, Nacho and Luka Modric joined Real legend Paco Gento as the only players to win the European Cup six times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carlo Ancelotti also extended his record as the most successful coach in the competition's history with his fifth title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A record number of more than 2,500 stewards were in place at Wembley with the authorities keen to avoid a repeat of the violent scenes that marred the Euro 2020 final three years ago when ticketless fans stormed the turnstiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But further questions over the security operation will be raised as three pitch invaders were able to enter the field in the opening minutes of the game, with one taking photos alongside Jude Bellingham and Vinicius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti said pre-match he felt "like a lion" after an afternoon siesta, but his side were caught napping for the first 45 minutes as, roared on by the travelling thousands from Germany, Dortmund dominated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti's decision to recall Courtois for his first Champions League appearance of the season after a serious knee injury paid dividends as the Belgian kept his side in the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best chances fell to Adeyemi as Carvajal could not contain the German international's pace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A brilliant pass by Mats Hummels put Adeyemi clean through, but he took a heavy touch under pressure from Courtois and ran too wide before his shot was blocked by Carvajal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug's barrel-chested physique has made him a fan favourite in his first season at Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German international striker came closest to breaking the deadlock before half-time when his effort from Ian Maatsen's through ball came back off the inside of the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adeyemi was then denied once more by Courtois from a narrow angle and Fuellkrug could not twist his hulking frame to turn in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, Nacho and Modric were keen to stress on the eve of the match that Madrid's habit of finding a way to get over the line in the Champions League was no coincidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having ridden their luck once more in the first half, the Spanish champions found their feet in the second period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gregor Kobel was finally forced into a save on 48 minutes from Kroos, who came close to marking the final game of his club career with a spectacular free-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham was moulded into a world star during three years at Dortmund before leaving for Madrid 12 months ago for more than 100 million euros (US$108 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England international was inches away from biting the hand that used to feed him as he just could not get a telling touch on Vinicius' teasing cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid landed the decisive blow 16 minutes from time when Carvajal rose highest to head in Kroos' corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobel then briefly kept his side alive with fine saves from Eduardo Camavinga and Nacho, while Bellingham's goalbound effort was deflected behind by Nico Schlotterbeck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Bellingham did have a moment to savour on his homecoming as his pass teed up Vinicius to kill of Dortmund despite Kobel getting a hand to the Brazilian's scuffed shot. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters in Tel Aviv are hoping the Israeli government will accept President Biden's proposal. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755749_1_20240602042102.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two far-right Israeli ministers threatened on Saturday to quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau's government if he goes ahead with a hostage release deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Friday that Israel had offered a new roadmap towards a full ceasefire including the release of hostages held by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said they would quit his government if the deal went ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir said his party would "dissolve the government" if the deal went through and slammed the proposal as "a victory for terrorism and a security risk to the State of Israel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Agreeing to such a deal is not total victory – but total defeat," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smotrich said he would "not be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We demand the continuation of the war until Hamas is destroyed and all hostages return," Smotrich said on X, adding that he opposes the return of displaced Gazans to the territory's north and the "wholesale release of terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Saturday, Netanyahu insisted that the destruction of Hamas was part of the Israeli plan laid out by Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid vowed to offer Netanyahu "our safety net for a hostage deal if Ben Gvir and Smotrich leave the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without Ben Gvir's and Smotrich's parties, Netanyahu's coalition could lose its majority in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of Israelis meanwhile rallied in Tel Aviv to demand acceptance of the ceasefire and hostage release deal outlined by Biden, with many fearing the premier would disown the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope that somehow Biden puts enough pressure so the government and Netanyahu will take the deal," said protester Diti Kapuano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 36,379 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments and ground offensive since October 7, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run territory. (AFP)

    Election in Mexico already deadliest in recent history

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ruling party hopeful Claudia Sheinbaum is widely expected to win Sunday's vote and become Mexico's first female president. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755746_2_20240602024144.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico's election is now the bloodiest in its modern history after a candidate running for local office in central Puebla state was murdered on Friday at a political rally, taking the number of assassinated candidates to 37 ahead of Sunday's vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jorge Huerta Cabrera, a candidate who was running for a council seat in the town of Izucar de Matamoros, was gunned down in the attack, according to the state prosecutor's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing takes the number of assassinated candidates in the 2024 election season to 37, one more than during the 2021 midterm election when 36 candidates were killed, according to data from security consultancy Integralia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violent crime has emerged as one of the top issues in this year's presidential contest, in which the ruling party of outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been forced to defend a persistently high murder rate, as the opposition has sought to use the bloodshed to argue for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruling party hopeful Claudia Sheinbaum is widely expected to win Sunday's vote and become Mexico's first female president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's possible that violence is being used as a means to define the election in advance, particularly when certain interests are perceived to be at risk in the event that a particular political project triumphs," said Armando Vargas, an Integralia researcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultancy has also counted 828 non-lethal attacks on candidates during the current election season, up from 749 since just Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts point to Mexico's mix of powerful drug cartels and often corrupt local governments as contributing to the dangers faced by candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a local mayoral candidate in southern Guerrero state was gunned down at point-blank range during a campaign rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was among 560 candidates and election officials who have been given security guards by the government due to persistent threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's grisly assassination was captured on video, with mayhem erupting at the rally after the shots rang out. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A last-minute problem nixed Saturday’s launch attempt for Boeing’s first astronaut flight, the latest in a string of delays over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two Nasa astronauts were strapped into the company’s Starliner capsule when the countdown was automatically halted at 3 minutes and 50 seconds by the computer system that controls the final minutes before lift off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With only a split second to take off, there was no time to work on the latest issue and everything was called off. It was not immediately clear why the computers aborted the countdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launch controllers were evaluating the data, said United Launch Alliance’s Dillon Rice. But it is possible the team could try again as soon as Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams remained in their capsule seats, as they waited for technicians to help them get out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first launch attempt on May 6 was delayed for leak checks and rocket repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa wants a backup to SpaceX, which has been flying its astronauts for four years. (AP)

 City of Troy won the Derby on Saturday to give trainer Aidan O'Brien a record-extending 10th success in the Epsom classic.

  The 3-1 favourite put a dismal run in the English 2,000 Guineas behind him to seal the Blue Riband, just as O'Brien's Auguste Rodin had done 12 months ago.

  "It was hard to know what would happen today but we still thought we had the best horse. It just didn't happen in the Guineas," said jockey Ryan Moore, partnering his fourth Derby winner.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cyril Ramaphosa's ANC has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755735_1_20240601214128.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC faced a search for allies to help it form a new government on Saturday after it lost its three-decade-old absolute majority in a watershed election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With 99 percent of the votes from Wednesday's election counted, President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress had only 40 percent, a catastrophic slump from the 57.5 it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks an historic turning point for South Africa as the party has enjoyed an absolute majority since 1994, when liberation leader Nelson Mandela led the nation out of white-minority rule and into democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC must now either negotiate a coalition government, or at least persuade other parties to back Ramaphosa's re-election in parliament to allow him to form a minority government reliant on other parties for support to pass budgets and legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been talking with everybody even before the election," ANC's deputy secretary general Nomvula Mokonyane said, saying the party's NEC decision-making body would meet to decide on a course of action after final results are announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about ensuring that the stability both in government and stability in our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She would not be drawn on whether the party might replace Ramaphosa after the party's record poor showing, saying: "For now, it's not an issue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As votes continued to be validated, data from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) held second place with 21.71 percent, slightly up on its 20.77 showing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party, which governs Western Cape province and has promised a free market agenda at odds with the ANC's left-wing traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the chances of a coalition with the ANC, Helen Zille, the DA party chairwoman, said: "Negotiations haven't started but some channels have been opened, individuals talking to individuals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also did not rule out allowing the ANC to attempt to rule alone, saying: "A minority government would be something completely new in South Africa but it is an option amongst others."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was not a surge by the DA that cut into the ANC's vote share.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In third place was former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) on 12.6 percent, a surprise score for a party founded just months ago as a vehicle for the former ANC chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was in fourth with 9.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malema and Zuma are former ANC members and some observers have suggested that they would be more natural partners for the ruling coalition, a prospect that the DA has branded the "Doomsday Coalition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other analysts, including author Susan Booysen, said the EFF was perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma – who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018 – was "too far reaching" to mend, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MK spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela seemed to agree. "We will engage with the ANC but not the ANC of Cyril Ramaphosa," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any coalition partner should be willing to amend the constitution to enact radical reforms and grant Zuma, who has been declared ineligible over a contempt of court conviction, a pardon, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC retains the loyalty of many voters for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 India's marathon election drew to a close on Saturday six weeks after voting began, with voters enduring a scorching heatwave to cast their ballots in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long been widely expected to win a third term when results are announced on Tuesday, in large part due to his cultivated image as an aggressive champion of India's majority faith.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exit polls – though historically unreliable at capturing voter shifts in an election with 968 million eligible voters – are expected to give some initial indication of whether he has succeeded later on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many in the 73-year-old premier's constituency of Varanasi were eager for that to be the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I voted for growth and development of my country," said local resident Brijesh Taksali outside a polling station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's only one leader that I know... Narendra Modi. I voted for him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varanasi is the spiritual capital of the Hindu faith, where devotees from around India come to cremate deceased loved ones by the Ganges river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is one of the final cities to vote in India's gruelling election, and where public support for Modi's ever-closer alignment of religion and politics burns brightest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has already led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in large part by his appeal to the Hindu faithful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, Modi presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque in Ayodhya razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction of the temple fulfilled a longstanding demand of Hindu activists and was widely celebrated across the country with back-to-back television coverage and street parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony, and numerous other chest-beating demonstrations of fidelity to India's majority religion over the past decade, have made many among the country's 200 million-plus minority Muslim community increasingly uneasy about their futures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi himself has made a number of strident comments about Muslims on the campaign trail, referring to them as "infiltrators."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has also accused the motley coalition of more than two dozen opposition parties contesting the poll against him of plotting to redistribute India's wealth to its Muslim citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Janesar Akhtar, a Muslim clothesmaker working in Varanasi's famed embroidery workshops, said that the BJP's sectarian campaigning was an unfortunate distraction from India's chronic unemployment problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Workshops here are closing down and the Modi government has been busy with the politics of temples and mosques," the 44-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is supposed to give us jobs and not tensions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long expected Modi to triumph against the opposition alliance, which at no point has named an agreed candidate for prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal probes into his opponents and a tax investigation this year that froze the bank accounts of Congress, India's largest opposition party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western democracies have largely sidestepped concerns over rights and democratic freedoms in the hopes of cultivating an ally that can help check the growing assertiveness of China, India's northern neighbour and rival regional power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's image at home has been bolstered by India's rising diplomatic and economic clout – the country overtook Britain as the world's fifth-biggest economy in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an Indian, I feel that he has ensured a lot of respect and prestige for India during his term," Shikha Aggarwal, 40, said while waiting to cast her vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People now look at India and Indians with a lot more respect, something not accorded earlier."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India has voted in seven phases over six weeks to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turnout is down several percentage points from the last national election in 2019, with analysts blaming widespread expectations of a Modi victory as well as successive heatwaves scorching India's northern states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in the eastern state of Bihar said on Friday that 10 poll workers had died of heatstroke the previous day while setting up for the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extensive scientific research shows climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense, with Asia warming faster than the global average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A scorching sun bore down on Varanasi and its countless temples and riverside crematoriums during Saturday's vote, with afternoon temperatures peaking at 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last few days have been very tough," housewife Bindwasvini Devi, who voted soon after polls opened to beat the scorching temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried to stay hydrated and avoided going out as much as possible." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A stretch of Hai Tan Street in Sham Shui Po has been closed for a week, after dramatically subsiding on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos from the scene show that a three by four metre patch of the road collapsed into the ground, to a depth of about three metres. A one-block stretch of the road will be out of use until Friday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at about 4pm on Friday about the subsidence. Officers cordoned off the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the authorities would have to carry out work on an underground water main at the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said on Saturday that all lanes of Hai Tan Street between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street would be closed to all traffic until 6am next Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said affected bus routes have been diverted.

    Everton pull plug on controversial takeover bid

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755713_1_20240601162959.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everton's takeover agreement with prospective owner 777 Partners has expired, the Premier League club said on Saturday, after the US private equity firm failed to complete the acquisition of Farhad Moshiri's majority stake by the Friday deadline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In September the Miami-based investment fund said it had signed an agreement with British-Iranian billionaire Moshiri to acquire his 94.1 percent stake in the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, initially expected to be closed by the end of 2023, was delayed as 777 Partners reportedly struggled to meet the necessary conditions outlined by the Premier League to complete their purchase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The agreement between 777 Partners and Blue Heaven Holdings Limited for the sale and purchase of the majority shareholding in the club expired today," Everton said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club's Board of Directors recognises the considerable level of financial support 777 Partners has provided the club over recent months and would like to take this opportunity to thank them for this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moshiri, a former Arsenal shareholder, first bought a 49.9 percent stake in Everton in 2016. By January 2022, he had increased his stake to 94.1 percent with a 100-million-pound (US$130-million) capital injection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite investing nearly US$810 million in transfers to build the squad since Moshiri's arrival, Everton have slipped out of the top half of the table to fight relegation battles in recent seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club finished 15th in the Premier League after being hit with two separate points deductions for breaching profit and sustainability rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton are now free to talk to other interested investors, with the BBC reporting that Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor, who is looking to sell his majority stake in the London club, would consider Everton as an opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club will continue to operate as usual, while it works with Blue Heaven Holdings to assess all options for the club’s future ownership," Everton said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's president-elect, Prabowo Subianto, said on Saturday that his country was willing to send peacekeeping troops to enforce a ceasefire in Gaza if required.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security conference, Prabowo said US President Joe Biden's three-phase proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza was a step in the right direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When needed and when requested by the UN, we are prepared to contribute significant peacekeeping forces to maintain and monitor this prospective ceasefire as well as providing protection and security to all parties and to all sides," Prabowo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 72-year-old former special forces general and current Indonesian defence minister takes on the presidency of the world's most populous Muslim nation in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said President Joko Widodo had instructed him to announce that Indonesia was also ready "to evacuate, to receive and to treat with medical care up to 1,000 patients" from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Indonesia Hospital in Gaza, which was run by an Indonesia NGO, closed in November amid the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo said a comprehensive investigation into the humanitarian disaster in the Rafah area of Gaza was needed as well as a "just solution" to the situation in Palestine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And that means the rights of not only Israel to exist, but also the rights of the Palestinian people to have their own homeland, their own state, living in peace." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory cancelled all storm signals at 5.40pm on Saturday as storm Maliksi weakened and moved further from the territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said storm Maliksi was moving across Qingyuan in Guangdong and would gradually move away from Hong Kong. It had downgraded the Strong Wind Signal Number 8 to the Standby Signal Number 1 an hour earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maliksi or its remnant is expected to bring more showers with occasional squalls to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary tonight and tomorrow morning," the Observatory said. "Members of the public should stay on the alert."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With seas expected to be rough with swells, people are being advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.

 Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa cancelled his "dearMoon" mission, which the project said was to have been the first private flight around the moon, the mission announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The team had originally aimed to make the circumlunar flight, with celebrities on board, by the end of last year but that became "unfeasible", the mission said in a statement on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without clear schedule certainty in the near-term, it is with a heavy heart that Maezawa made the unavoidable decision to cancel the project," it said. "To all who have supported this project and looked forward to this endeavor, we sincerely appreciate it and apologize for this outcome."
  <br/>

  The statement did not give further details on the cause of the cancellation. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's first homegrown passenger aircraft made its return to Hong Kong on Saturday to fly more than 100 university students for a visit to Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The C919 made its debut in the SAR in December, delighting spectators with a spectacular flypast over Victoria Harbour. This time it's serving a charter flight for participants in a youth internship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony at the airport, Chief Secretary Eric Chan welcomed the aircraft's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The C919 returns to Hong Kong today, taking young people in Hong Kong to Shanghai to experience life at a mainland airport," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, they will experience national affairs and development at first hand.I believe this experience will be unforgettable for all the students and will be useful for their lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students onboard the flight told RTHK that they were excited to learn more about the aviation industry on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to have this opportunity to take the first C919 flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Through this opportunity, I can learn more about the homegrown aircraft industry on the mainland," said one student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she hoped the seats would be comfy and wondered whether meals would be served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is my first time to take the domestically-made plane. I'm interested to know whether the facilities on the plane will be different than those from other countries," said another student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Andrew Yao who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong-Shanghai Associations, said he hopes students can learn more about the development of the Belt and Road initiative through the internship programme.

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755690_1_20240601122614.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored a pair of power-play goals to lead the Edmonton Oilers to a 3-1 victory over the host Dallas Stars on Friday and put them one win away from the Stanley Cup Final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Philip Broberg added his first career playoff goal and Stuart Skinner made 19 saves for the Oilers, who lead the best-of-seven Western Conference final 3-2. They will try to finish the series Sunday night at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even Bouchard posted two assists, which gives the defenseman 25 points in Edmonton's 17 playoff games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wyatt Johnston replied for the Stars, the conference's regular-season champions, who have lost two straight games in the series. Goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 23 shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nugent-Hopkins netted the first power-play goal of the series for either team when he opened the scoring at 14:09 of the first period. After Bouchard's point shot was stopped, Nugent-Hopkins chipped a back-handed rebound attempt into the cage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nugent-Hopkins, the 2011 first overall draft choice who is Edmonton's longest serving player, doubled the lead with another man-advantage marker 66 seconds into the second period. He was fed a pass in the slot and whipped a shot off the post and into the net for his sixth goal of the playoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Broberg, who played his first game of the playoffs in Game 4, netted his milestone marker at 5:09 of the middle frame with a long slap shot that beat Oettinger's glove hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnston finally put the Stars on the board with 5:51 remaining in regulation by deflecting a point shot for his 10th goal of the playoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It snapped Skinner's shutout streak at 108 minutes and 43 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Stars, who were held to only four shots on goal in the first period, had a tough time generating many shots the whole game, but Skinner provided a few key saves, including a clutch denial of Johnston's attempt from the slot when it was a 2-0 count.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean defence minister Shin Won-sik said on Saturday that more evidence suggests weapons used by Russia in the war in Ukraine were illegally imported from North Korea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Military cooperation between Russia and North Korea" is escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and "also affecting the battlefield in Europe", Shin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If North Korea continues to receive military technology transfers from Russia in return, a significant improvement in North Korea's conventional military capability is an imminent risk, Shin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On questions about whether South Korea may seek nuclear weapons of its own, Shin said that South Korea trusts the global nonproliferation treaty (NPT) regime, and that a stronger US-South Korean alliance is the answer to North Korea's nuclear development.

 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said a proposal to integrate waste management across the Greater Bay Area does not simply mean Hong Kong will send its rubbish for disposal across the border.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister confirmed that the authorities are mulling working with mainland counterparts on handling and recycling waste to achieve carbon neutrality and build a waste-free bay area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tse said the plan is not to ship waste to the rest of the Greater Bay Area for incineration, but to recycle and reuse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To achieve carbon neutrality, many countries have been promoting resource circulation. This concept is not difficult to understand. It simply means turning resources into products, such as the clothes you are wearing or the chair you are sitting on. It's not sustainable if all these products end up turning into garbage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added he is confident that Hong Kong will be able to deal with a daily average of around 11,000 tonnes of garbage after the territory's three incinerators are put into operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waste integration proposal came after the SAR announced on Monday that it was shelving a territory-wide waste charging scheme for a third time. The minister reiterated that the move does not mean the government is pausing its waste reduction efforts.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Friday said it strongly disapproved and condemned the US Department of State for proposing visa restriction on Beijing and SAR officials responsible for implementing the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington said on Friday that it was taking steps to put the visa restrictions in place after the trial under the NSL of 47 people on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion. It gave no further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the defendants were acquitted and fourteen were found guilty, with the remainder pleading guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a spokesman for the SAR government said: “The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate PRC and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong's affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR despises such threat and will not be intimidated by such a despicable behaviour.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added that the SAR would continue to do its duty in safeguarding national security, adding that the findings of the judges in the case on Wednesday “clearly confirmed that the criminal acts in the case aimed at undermining, destroying or overthrowing the existing political system and structure of the HKSAR established under the Basic Law and the 'one country, two systems' principle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such criminal acts endangering national security had nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights,” the statement added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrics expert on Saturday said there's been no easing of the winter flu outbreak in Hong Kong, and he expects the situation to continue for several more weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Hong Kong said the number of influenza cases would usually fall off in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of the influenza outbreak [had] been persistent throughout May, and we are expecting actually even in June, there will still be a few more weeks of influenza outbreak affecting many of our young children," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, we find most of those severe influenza cases, including the death cases, occur more dominantly in young children, particularly with those without any influenza vaccination."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged parents to get their children vaccinated. Four children have died of flu so far this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Friday that businesses he met on a visit to California only wanted to talk about the business environment in Hong Kong and did not raise national security matters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan made a visit to San Francisco, together with delegations from Guangdong Province and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong and partners in San Francisco signed three memorandums of understanding on developing carbon markets, sustainable finance, investment promotion and the nurturing of talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief said businesses in the United States were "curious" and "interested" in the opportunities available in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The business proposition we put to the business sector here is that the Greater Bay Area as a market is of huge size: 87 million people. This is one of the most affluent, most dynamic, economically very high vitality areas," he told reporters in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Presenting tremendous opportunities for the business sector here, no matter if it is for consumer market or for extending the service or solutions onto the mainland, the exchanges that we have with them proved this proposition to be quite attractive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding national security, Chan said businesses in the United States had other concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No question has ever been raised in this respect... In fact, the concern and the interest of the business sector here is the stability of Hong Kong, the overall business environment, the impact of high interest rates on Hong Kong, and also the performance of stock market, the property market, as well as foreign business interest and investment in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan was due to arrive back in the SAR on Saturday morning.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sun Dong, pictured with host Eugene Chan, said that Hong Kong has the advantages to become an international I&T centre. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755668_1_20240601090134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong says the innovation and technology sector in Hong Kong has made a lot of progress in the past few years with the I&T ecosystem becoming more vibrant than before, adding that the SAR serves as a super value adder to foster global collaboration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has the advantages to becoming an international I&T centre with its top institutions, experts and scholars, a mature intellectual property rights protection system, a robust rule of law and a good business environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, the Hong Kong government has invested more than HK$210 billion to enhance technological research infrastructure, subsidise R&D activities, support collaboration among industry, academic and research sectors, as well as put together nurtured technology talents," he told RTHK's Your Home Address programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has rolled out a number of policies to attract, retain and nurture talents, including the Technology Talent Admission Scheme, meant for admitting technology talents to conduct R&D work in Hong Kong, the STEM Internship Scheme for university students to gain experience in the field and the New Industrialisation and Technology Training Programme to subsidise training for staff in local companies on advanced technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I put together local and non-local researchers to conduct world-class and impactful scientific research. For this InnoHK research clusters, this is a very successful programme aiming to promote the global research collaboration. So far, we have established 29 InnoHK research centres in Hong Kong Science Park in collaboration with more than 30 top-notch universities and research institutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the two clusters, one is life and health technology and the other one is robotics and AI. To further expand this successful programme, we are going to build a third cluster focused on advanced manufacturing, sustainable development, new energy and material as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the recently launched Research Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) has been very successful in supporting hundreds of university research teams to transfer their research outcomes into real applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said that authorities would accelerate digital economy development to build Hong Kong into a smart city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The Digital Policy Office] will be responsible for formulating policies on digital government, data governance and information technology, promoting the opening up of data and offering more digital services. This office will be in charge of introducing more digital government initiative for convenience and benefit of the public and business sector," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we plan to launch over 100 digital government smart city initiatives including providing the digital payments for all government services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the office would also work closely with the Guangdong province to promote cross-boundary public services initiative in both areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun believes that Hong Kong can put together the innovation resources from the GBA and the world to promote development and investment, making the territory the best springboard for overseas markets to venture into the GBA, the mainland and the Asian market.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey continues to showcase strong in-season form through the 2024 season. In the 200m freestyle in Barcelona she took down the late Camille Muffat‘s Mare Nostrum Tour record, which had stood since 2008. Haughey clocked 1:54.57 for the win, undercutting Muffat’s record by .09 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey split 26.99/28.78/29.08/29.72 for the win and the new record. She is already ranked 3rd in the world this season behind Mollie O’Callaghan and Summer McIntosh with her 1:5408 from the Budapest stop of the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the race by more than three seconds, with Valentine Valerie Dumont the closest swimmer to her in 1:57.92. Dumont’s season best stands at 1:57.57 from back in February but this was another solid in-season swim from her and the 4th fastest of her career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey had to settle for silver in the women’s 50 freestyle, as Sweden’s Michelle Coleman eked out the win, out-touching her by .03 seconds. Coleman earned the win in 24.61, improving on her season best time from the 2024 World Championships (24.65).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first race of the session, Haughey swam 24.64. That’s the 4th fastest swim of her career and her fastest in 2024. Her 2023-24 season best is a 24.62 from the U.S Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia’s Neža Klančar earned 3rd place in 24.83. Like Haughey, it’s her fastest swim in 2024 as it betters the 24.87 mark that she swam in Doha. In December, she swam her personal best of 24.70. (SwimSwam)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal at 5:40 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It had been issued at 3:25 am, and heavy rain was expected to fall generally over Hong Kong, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory had warned that there might be flooding in some low-lying and poorly drained areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who were likely to be affected were advised to take all necessary precautions to reduce their exposure to risk posed by the heavy rain and flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People should stay alert to the danger that may be brought about by river flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said people should stay away from watercourses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day mainly higher on Friday, with the Dow and S&P both rising after April data for the Fed's favoured inflation measure broadly matched expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The moves came after Commerce Department data showed that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, largely unchanged from March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 1.5 percent at 38,686, while the S&P 500 ended the day 0.8 percent higher at 5,277.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq was the only major New York index that did not rise on Friday, closing almost unchanged at 16,735.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're on track for a positive month," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones said before the closing bell, adding that there was often "a bit of rebalancing" at the end of the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe on Monday that could easily be reversed," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual firms, tech firm Dell Technologies tumbled 17.9 percent despite beating earnings expectations, with some analysts pointing to a lower-than-expected backlog for artificial intelligence servers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the apparel company Gap saw its shares surge 28.6 percent after beating earnings expectations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Saturday afternoon that the Strong Wind Signal No 3 would be replaced sometime between 3pm and 6pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said at noon that Tropical Cyclone Maliksi had weakened into a tropical depression as it passed over Guangdong province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory says it will consider issuing either the Standby Signal No 1 or the Strong Monsoon Signal, depending on how Maliksi weakens over inland areas and changes in the local wind conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that seas will be rough with swells and members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Strong Wind Signal No 3 is still in force, classes of kindergartens, schools for children with physical disability and schools for children with intellectual disability are suspended today.

    Questioning Trump guilty verdict 'dangerous': Biden

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that it was "dangerous" for people to question the integrity of the guilty verdict in Donald Trump's hush money jury trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his first public comments since a New York jury on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts over a payment to silence an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election, Biden, a Democrat, struck out hard at Trump and other Republicans who have criticised the verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself." Biden said. He noted that the case against Trump in New York was brought by the state, that it was not a federal case, and that the verdict was delivered by "a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US justice system has endured for nearly 250 years, Biden said, and he criticised Trump and his supporters for attempting to tear it down with false allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's reckless, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In rambling remarks earlier on Friday at the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan, Trump repeated his complaints that the trial was an attempt to hobble his comeback White House bid and said it showed that no American was safe from politically motivated prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone," Trump said in an unscripted 33-minute speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's guilty verdict catapults the United States into unexplored territory ahead of the November 5 vote, when Trump, 77, will try to win back the White House from Biden, 81. (Reuters)

    Biden says Israel offers new roadmap to end Gaza war

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The US president has urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755636_1_20240601031825.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Israel was offering a new roadmap towards a full ceasefire in Gaza that he urged Hamas to accept, saying it's "time for this war to end."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's intervention, which had been heavily trailed, came as Israeli troops pushed into central Rafah, escalating its nearly eight-month war with Hamas despite international objections to any assault on the south Gaza city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came as top diplomat Antony Blinken acknowledged that despite US efforts to get more aid into Gaza, the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory remained "dire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first major address outlining how the Gaza war might end, Biden said that Israel's three-stage offer would begin with a six-week phase that would see Israeli forces withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also see the "release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, in exchange for (the) release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and the Palestinians would then negotiate during those six weeks for a lasting ceasefire – but the truce would continue while the talks remained underway, Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US president urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's time for this war to end, for the day after to begin," he said, adding: "We can't lose this moment" to seize the chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After successive rounds of indirect negotiations in recent months all failed, Hamas said earlier on Friday that it had informed mediators it would only agree a "comprehensive" truce including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its "aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, accused Israel of "using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression," saying Hamas "refuses to be a part of these manoeuvres."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas since the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel sent tanks and troops into Rafah in early May, ignoring concerns over the safety of displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in the city on the Egyptian border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, soldiers were operating in the city centre where they uncovered rocket launchers and tunnel shafts and dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A stream of civilians has flooded out of Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Food Programme said daily life had become "apocalyptic" in parts of southern Gaza since Israel began its assault on Rafah in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency was able to provide "ever decreasing amounts of assistance," with all of its bakeries in Rafah closed due to a lack of fuel and supplies, its director for the Palestinian territories, Matthew Hollingworth, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan announced it will host a summit on June 11, jointly organised with Egypt and the United Nations, bringing together aid agency chiefs and heads of donor governments to discuss the humanitarian response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas released a video on Telegram on Friday featuring the audio of a woman's voice, who they said was one of the hostages. The audio file could not immediately be verified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,284 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

 The Hong Kong Observatory issued the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal at 3:25 am, meaning that heavy rain has fallen or is expected to fall generally over Hong Kong, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour, and is likely to continue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There will be flooding in some low-lying and poorly drained areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who are likely to be affected should take necessary precautions to reduce their exposure to risk posed by the heavy rain and flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain may bring about flash floods.

    S Africa set for coalition talks as ANC loses majority

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Representatives of the ANC follow live voting results at the Independent Electoral Commission. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755632_1_20240601022857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on track on Friday to score its worst electoral result ever, with the latest tallies showing voters deserted the party in droves and ended its 30-year political dominance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The African National Congress (ANC) is now all but certain to fall below 50 percent of the vote, forcing the party to seek a coalition partner to have enough backing to name a president and form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks an historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, as the party has enjoyed an absolute parliamentary majority since 1994, when its then leader Nelson Mandela led the nation out of white minority rule and into democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With more than two thirds of the votes cast in Wednesday's general election counted, the ANC remained in the lead but with a score below 42 percent, compared to the 57 percent it won in 2019 and far off the 62 percent secured by Mandela in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As votes continued to be validated, data from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) held second place with 22.64 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was not a surge by the DA that cut into the ANC's vote share.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In third place was former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) on 12 percent, a surprise score for a party founded barely six months ago as a vehicle for the former ANC chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected at the weekend, but with the trends clear and the votes stacking up on the IEC website, politicians and pundits were turning their attention to the prospects of an ANC-led coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party, but if the latest, President Cyril Ramaphosa, is to remain at the helm he will have to decide whether to seek allies on his right or his left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be resistance within his movement to a tie-up with the second-placed DA, under white politician John Steenhuisen, whose pro-free market programme of privatisation and an end to black economic empowerment programmes is at odds with the ruling party's traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there will also be reluctance to invite Zuma, who left government facing a raft of corruption allegations, or firebrand Julius Malema's radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) into government after both fought bitter campaigns against their former party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC retains the loyalty of many voters for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts expect the party to patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups, especially as the Zuma's MK has stormed to victory in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The MK has really eaten into the ANC's vote," said Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, like analyst and author Susan Booysen, said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma – who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018 – was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might instead prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But another outside observer, political analyst and business leader Sandile Swana, argued that Ramaphosa's authority had take such a beating in the election that he would not be able to push reluctant party bigwigs to accept a DA alliance. "His power is gone within the ANC," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe's highly anticipated move to Spanish champions Real Madrid will be made official early next week, a source close to the negotiations said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The captain of the French national team, who will be available on June 30 when his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, has decided to sign for Real after seven seasons in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His entourage did not immediately respond to enquiries about the rumour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the move is announced as expected on Monday or Tuesday, Mbappe is unlikely, according to several media outlets, to be presented in the Spanish capital before the end of Euro 2024, which runs from June 14 to July 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the moment, he is expected to remain with the France team which has been in camp in Clairefontaine since Wednesday ahead of two Euro warm-up matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They face Luxembourg in Metz on Wednesday and Canada in Bordeaux four days later. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" in Gaza as Israel pushes in deeper, despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke a day after USAID chief Samantha Power quoted aid workers as saying that the "conditions are worse now than ever before" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The humanitarian situation remains dire for people in Gaza," Blinken told reporters in Prague when asked about Power's remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've seen changes – some positive changes – but the net effect is not there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken added that while the number of aid trucks entering Gaza was up "significantly," distribution remained difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed to the impact of Israeli military operations around the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah and the closure of the Rafah border into Egypt after Israel seized control of the crossing from the Hamas militant group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're not just measuring inputs, we're measuring impact. And yes, the impact remains insufficient in terms of addressing the acute needs of children, women and men in Gaza," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has pursued military operations in Rafah despite a warning from President Joe Biden, though the White House says the assault is smaller than the type of massive operation which he had called unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has built a temporary pier into Gaza at a cost of at least US$320 million, but it was damaged in poor weather, suspending deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,2844 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    US Fed's favoured inflation measure remains unchanged

    <![CDATA[<img alt='New York Fed president John Williams says he expects inflation will "resume moderating in the second half of this year." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755624_1_20240531232750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation remained unchanged in April, according to government data published on Friday, as services prices remained elevated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news will likely lead the US central bank to keep interest rates elevated throughout the summer, as it balances a desire to start easing monetary policy with the need to keep inflation falling towards its long-term two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said in a statement, while monthly inflation increased by 0.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures were in line with the median forecast in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, and came in at the same level as it did in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After falling for much of last year, inflation accelerated again at the start of 2024, reducing the likelihood of early rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High rates also complicate US President Joe Biden's reelection message as he seeks to convince still-sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, services sector inflation drove much of the increase, rising at an annual rate of 3.9 percent – slightly lower than a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stripping out volatile food and energy prices – both of which continued to rise last month – the closely watched "core" measure of inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in April, in line with expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This suggests that underlying inflation remains elevated, a fact which could keep the Fed on pause for longer than previously anticipated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, New York Fed president John Williams, who is a permanent voting member of the US central bank's rate-setting committee, said he expected inflation would "resume moderating in the second half of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at all the data, I don't feel any urgency or need to make a decision now," he told an event in New York, adding that things were going in the "right direction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data published on Friday also show that personal income eased to 0.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department said, down slightly from 0.5 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Personal savings as a percentage of disposable income came in at 3.6 percent in last month, in line with the revised figure from March. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday said it would be "difficult" for it to take part in a planned conference on the war in Ukraine in June if Russia did not attend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine is trying to whip up attendance at the peace conference in Switzerland, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part but Beijing insisted any summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing believes the conference "should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans", foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace," she said. (AFP)

    'Unlikely the Republican Party will abandon Trump'

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755610_1_20240531203313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A political scholar on Friday said it was unlikely the Republican Party would abandon Donald Trump as its presumptive presidential nominee.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The former president was convicted in an historic criminal case of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Wong, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, said Trump retains strong support from his party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said that Trump's conviction may affect independent voters in swing states, but he didn't think it would benefit his challenger, President Joe Biden, a great deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no reason to think that Trump is therefore ineligible. And that's because the US Constitution has only three requirements when it comes to eligibility for candidacy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One, the candidate must be at least 35 years old. Secondly, they must be a natural born US citizen. And thirdly, they must have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There's no stipulation that they must not have a criminal record. So this will not affect his nominal and technical eligibility to run as a candidate should the Republican National Convention decide that is indeed to be the case."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said a woman arrested on Wednesday is suspected of committing the offence of “providing pecuniary or other financial assistance or property for the commission of secession by other persons” under the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said their investigation revealed the woman had provided HK$140,000 to fugitive Nathan Law and other individuals through an online subscription platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman was one of seven people arrested this week on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, which include former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were linked to suspected seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 4.40pm, and added it would remain in force until at least 6am on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming said the chance of issuing a higher signal is rather low, unless Tropical Storm Maliksi rapidly intensifies or tracks closer to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Maliksi would make landfall in the western part of Guangdong around midnight tonight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of 5pm, Maliksi was estimated to be about 290 kilometres southwest of Hong Kong. It is forecast to be slow-moving at first, and then move northwards later at about 15 kilometres per hour, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we look at the radar imageries, we can see that the squally showers and strong winds associated with Maliksi are gradually affecting the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary. Local winds will strengthen progressively."

    Hong Kong retail sales fall in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The value of total retail sales for April dropped nearly 15 percent compared with the same month in 2023. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755577_1_20240531170816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Provisional data from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the city's retail sales for April fell 14.7 percent from a year earlier, partly due to a drop in visitor spending and a large number of outbound trips during the Easter holidays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales decreased to HK$29.6 billion in the second consecutive month of decline after a seven percent drop in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first four months of 2024 taken together, it was provisionally estimated the value of total retail sales decreased by 4.7 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in April 2024 saw it decrease by 16.5 percent compared with a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined notably in April from a year earlier, partly because the Easter holidays rendered the effects of the changing consumption pattern of residents more visible," a government spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large number of residents made outbound trips during the Easter holidays. This not only affected their local consumption during their time away but also could have reduced consumption in the days before and after the trips."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that unstable weather in April also had an impact on spending. Looking ahead, he said the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents would continue to pose a challenge to the local retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the government hoped the revival of inbound tourism and rising earnings, as well as the new round of mega events plus the recent stabilisation of asset markets such as property would provide support to the market and boost the economy.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday condemned criticisms made by the United States, Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, as well as foreign media over the recent subversion trial involving 47 defendants, calling them groundless.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned "primary election" organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the court had carefully considered the law, evidence and arguments presented by the prosecution and defence during the 118-day trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said the verdict clearly stated the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR, which is established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such illegal acts, which endanger national security, have nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 47 people were charged in the case. With the exception of two individuals, for whom there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the court that they were involved in the conspiracy, all 45 others were convicted, demonstrating the scale and seriousness of the conspiracy. The Department of Justice has informed the court of its intention to appeal against the acquittal of the two defendants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government demanded that the US and other Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, and foreign media stop spreading false reports and malicious attacks on the court's ruling in this case.

 The Department of Health warned people on Friday not to fall for fraudulent advertisements circulating online about free medical insurance by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health authorities said in a statement that false advertisements carrying the department's logo claimed the government would provide medical insurance for people aged 55 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they have reported the case to police, adding that all remarks in those advertisements are false.

 The Observatory said the strong wind signal No. 3 will be issued at 4.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A tropical depression over the northern part of the South China Sea is forecast to move north, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said according to the present forecast track, it will make landfall in western Guangdong from Friday evening to early Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said while the tropical depression is expected to move across inland of western Guangdong, the associated rainbands will still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 3.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standby signal No 1 has been in force since 5.40pm on Thursday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese and American defence chiefs held talks in Singapore on Friday, offering hopes for more military dialogue that could help prevent disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Dong Jun met with US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first meeting between the defence chiefs of the two countries since 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dong and Austin began the talks at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum, a member of the US delegation told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of China-US relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides agreed after a summit between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks. That includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea. (Agencies)

 Licence applications for taxi fleets ended on Friday, with an industry representative saying his group would invest more than HK$100 million in a squad of cabs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The licensed taxi fleet system is part of wider efforts to improve the service quality of point-to-point transport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the government, fleets operating in urban areas should have 300 to 1,000 taxis each, whereas those in the New Territories should have 100 to 350 cabs each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And participating taxis must not be in use for more than three years when a licence is offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities are expected to issue a maximum of five licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yue-ting, from the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, said he believes around eight applications were submitted before the noon deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Wong said he and 12 other operators have joined hands in applying for a licence in the New Territories, in hopes of improving cab services there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the group would have to invest at least HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I estimate that, for the first six months, we would invest HK$3 million to HK$5 million in a taxi-hailing service, plus dash cameras and other systems in the vehicles," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the vehicles, we'll mostly have to replace the existing ones because many of them would have been in use for more than three years when they are licensed. I think more than 80 percent of the taxis no longer fit the requirement. Each taxi will cost about HK$400,000, which means an expenditure of HK$100 million to replace some 300 vehicles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, said he submitted an application for a fleet of about 400 taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said mainland ride-hailing giants Didi Chuxing and Gaode had contacted him on proposing to work together.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to Spain's Madrid Zoo Aquarium were on Thursday introduced to a giant panda couple from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Male Jin Xi and female Zhu Yu, both born in 2020, arrived last month at the zoo following the renewal of its agreement for giant panda protection with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed a smooth quarantine period before making their debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sofia, the former queen of Spain, hosted the official introduction of the three-year-old bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are proud to host this unique species and to contribute to its preservation," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Ambassador to Spain, Yao Jing, highlighted that "the friendly bond" created by the pandas would unite the two peoples and serve as "an important symbol of China-Spain friendship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the debut of the giant panda couple, visitors to the zoo can now participate in educational activities every weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We try to bring information about pandas to the public so they can know pandas better and how we can protect the species," zoo staff Luis Manchado, who is responsible for the educational section, told Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two pandas are set to remain in Spain for the next 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has loaned its treasured bears to overseas zoos over the years as goodwill ambassadors, while also running conservation programmes back home that have seen their status improve from endangered to vulnerable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dallas Mavericks, fueled by 36 points each from Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-103 on Thursday to clinch the Western Conference crown and book an NBA title showdown with the Boston Celtics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Denied a sweep at home on Tuesday, the Mavs left no room for doubt in Minneapolis as they wrapped up the best-of-seven conference finals 4-1 to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since they won the title in 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics will host game one of the championship series on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenian star Doncic and Irving had their way with the league's top-rated defense, Doncic taking the game by the throat in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He scored four of his six three-pointers in the first period, including a bomb from the center court logo, and the Mavs closed the quarter on a 17-1 scoring run to put the Timberwolves on their heels for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irving got going with 15 points in the second quarter as he and Doncic combined for 44 first-half points – four more than the Timberwolves put on the board before halftime, when the Mavs led 69-40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 points each for Minnesota, Towns adding 12 rebounds for the third-seed Timberwolves, who had swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round and stunned the defending champion Denver Nuggets in seven games in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves had been 3-0 in elimination games this post-season, with wins in games six and seven against the Nuggets as well as their victory on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the early damage by Doncic and Dallas' disruptive defense put this one out of reach early and the Mavs grabbed the first double-digit victory of a hard-fought series.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says it will halt tariff concessions from June 15 for some Taiwan products that currently enjoy preferential tariff rates stipulated in the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), in response to the island's trade restrictions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement was made on Friday by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The special rates will be removed from 134 goods, including machine tools and industrial chemicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China in December suspended tariff concessions for some products under the ECFA, but the Finance Ministry said the island has not reciprocated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Taiwan region has unilaterally adopted discriminatory measures such as prohibiting and restricting the export of mainland products, which violates the provisions of the (agreement)," the ministry said. (Xinhua & agencies)

    'Ruling shows national security risks exist in HK'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The court ruling on a subversion trial showed that national security risks exist in Hong Kong, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, three national security judges convicted 14 people of conspiring to commit subversion, relating to an opposition plot to take control of the Legislative Council to disrupt government operations. Prosecutors also announced their intention to appeal against the acquittal of two others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said people have to read the court verdict carefully and safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the government will take action against anti-China behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The court ruling reflects that national security risks in Hong Kong truly exist. It's not like what some people said that they were just chanting some slogans and advocating for freedom. Their goal was to destroy Hong Kong, disrupt Hong Kong's constitutional order, paralyse the Hong Kong government, and on a deeper level, use Hong Kong as a base to inhibit the country's development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one fighting for democracy and freedom would hope to paralyse the government or have the streets filled with petrol bombs, Chan said.

 Hong Kong boxer Ruru Yang became WIBA Super Bantamweight champion on Thursday, defeating Thailand's Tanwarat Saengiamjit in Bangkok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old won by unanimous decision after 10 rounds in the Thai capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She adds the previously-vacant WIBA Super Bantamweight belt to her WBC Asia Super Flyweight crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang went into the bout with an undefeated record in five professional fights, with two wins coming by way of TKO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saengiamjit, with a record of nine wins and one loss, had already failed at a shot at the super bantamweight title in 2015 –  when she lost to New Zealand's Gentiane Lupi
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang is now undefeated in six fights since turning professional in 2022.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Should Donald Trump win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755463_1_20240531051916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New York jury convicted Donald Trump on all charges in his hush money case on Thursday in a seismic development barely five months ahead of the election where he seeks to recapture the White House.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic first criminal trial of a former US president ended with the 77-year-old Trump found guilty on each of the 34 charges of falsifying business records to hide a payment meant to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, who is all but certain to appeal, did not immediately react, but sat still, his shoulders dipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conviction thrusts the United States into uncharted political territory but does not bar Trump from a White House run, even in the unlikely event that Judge Juan Merchan sentences him to prison time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict comes just weeks before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is due to receive the party's formal nomination to face Democratic President Joe Biden on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12-member jury deliberated for more than 11 hours over two days at the end of the extraordinary five-week trial held in a drab Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election, when her claim to have had sex with him could have proved politically fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial featured lengthy testimony from the adult performer, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who described to the court in graphic detail what she says was a 2006 sexual encounter with the married Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors successfully laid out a case alleging that the hush money and the illegal covering up of the payment was part of a broader crime to prevent voters from knowing about Trump's behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's defence attorneys had countered that "trying to influence an election" was simply "democracy" and that the former president did nothing wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial has distracted Trump from his campaign to unseat Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he milked the media attention throughout, with daily speeches in front of the cameras outside the courtroom in which he complained about being a political victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identities of the 12 jurors deciding the case were kept secret, a rare practice more often see in cases involving mafia or other violent defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After teasing the prospect for weeks, Trump – who denied ever having sex with Daniels at a 2006 celebrity golf tournament – opted not to testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican, who made his name as a brash real estate mogul before a stunning ascent to the nation's highest office in the 2016 election, now faces prison or, more likely, probation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In theory, he could face up to four years in jail for each count of falsifying business records but legal experts said as a first-time offender he is unlikely to go behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An appeal could take months to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Should he win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself, given that the case was not brought by the federal government but by the state of New York, where only the governor could clear his name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also faces federal and state charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden, and for hoarding secret documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks fell for a second straight session on Thursday following a downgrade in a US growth report as several large tech shares tumbled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the January to March period, the Commerce Department said, below the 1.6 percent figure published last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Dow member Salesforce plunged nearly 20 percent as the technology company published mixed results and lowered some of its full-year projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other large tech companies followed Salesforce lower. Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon all fell 1.5 percent or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 38,111.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent to 5,235, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 16,737.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses came on the heels of Wednesday's session in which major indices retreated amid worries that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high due to persistent inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about interest rates. We don't see any relief in sight from the Fed," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "There is a growing view that they won't cut at all this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Best Buy soared 13.4 percent despite reporting a 6.1 percent drop in comparable sales as investors were encouraged by commentary suggesting an improvement in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Kohl's plunged 22.9 percent after results missed expectations. The retailer reported a loss of US$27 million. (AFP)

    ANC on track to lose majority after South Africa vote

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Cyril Ramaphosa was all smiles after casting his ballot at a polling station in Soweto. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755457_1_20240531031603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on course to lose its 30-year-old parliamentary majority on Thursday, opening the prospect that the party that defeated apartheid will have to share power for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With a third of votes in Wednesday's election tallied, the ANC was leading but with a score of only 42 percent – well below the 57 percent it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Followed by the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) on 25 percent. The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and former South African president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) were neck and neck on around nine percent each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected in the next three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The broad church of the ANC has taken a substantial knock. This is a shock to the system for the ANC and ultimately will also be a shock to the system for the average South African, who has only known ANC rule since 1994," said political analyst Daniel Silke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It redraws the political boundaries of South Africa and creates a degree of uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If President Cyril Ramaphosa's party is confirmed as dropping below 50 percent, it would force him to seek coalition partners to be re-elected to form a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would be a historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, which was underlined by newspaper headlines on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SA on the cusp of shift in politics," read the front page of daily BusinessDay. "The people have spoken," headlined The Citizen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party remains respected for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule, and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people in power are hopefully going to come down and we will have a new political party," Shaun Manyoni, a 21-year-old student, said in Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa's opponents from both the left and the right came to the polls on Wednesday hoping either to replace the ANC with an opposition alliance or force the party to negotiate a coalition agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Zuma ran this country perfectly ... so let's put him back and let South Africa run again," said Don Naidoo, a middle-aged small business owner from the province's largest city of Durban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voting was marked by hours-long queues in many districts, which in some cases forced polls to remain open well beyond closing time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said a last-minute rush in urban voting and high turnout were to blame for the late finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost all votes had been counted by 3:00 pm on Thursday, but most had yet to be validated, IEC's head Sy Mamabolo told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While, the process was "proceeding well," officials said they expected it would take longer than the usual 24 hours to reach an 80 percent tally, due to delays caused by the new three-ballot system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the ANC gets close to 50 percent it could shore up a majority by allying itself with some of the four dozen smaller and regional parties contesting the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this appeared increasingly unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts were split on who the ANC would prefer as bedfellows and on whether the poor performance threatened Ramaphosa's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His power is gone within the ANC," said analyst Sandile Swana, predicting that the party would patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups led by former ANC figures: firebrand Julius Malema's EFF or Zuma's MK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a major upset, the latter was leading with 43 percent of preferences in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, a key electoral battleground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg said MK was a natural partner for the ANC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have similar policies and similar tendencies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analyst and author Susan Booysen said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma, who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018, was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added. (AFP)

 Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna has ended speculation about his immediate future by signing a new four-year contract on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McKenna, 38, led the Portman Road club to a second successive promotion last season as Ipswich returned to the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That achievement saw him linked with the managerial vacancies at English top-flight rivals Brighton, Chelsea and Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am extremely proud to have signed a new contract with the club," McKenna told Ipswich's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enjoyed incredible success together over the last two seasons and I'm excited to have the opportunity and responsibility of leading this fantastic club into its first season in the Premier League in 22 years." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three main indexes were lower in New York at midday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755452_1_20240531004342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets diverged on Thursday, a day ahead of key inflation indicators that could determine the future direction of interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All the main indexes were lower in New York at midday, following on to Wednesday's slump when shares were hit by concerns that interest rates will not be coming down any time soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US shares were also hit by Salesforce slumping 21 percent after the software company reported disappointing results the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Treasury yields fell back after figures pointed to a slightly weakening US economy, though they were just off their recent highs, indicating expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's second update to first quarter GDP data showed it grew an annually adjusted 1.3 percent, slower than the initial estimate of 1.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders awaited Friday's release of the crucial personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, hoping for signs that prices are being brought under control enough for rates to be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though Treasury yields eased this morning from yesterday's four-week highs, the market appears anxious heading into PCE," said Joe Mazzola, a strategist at Charles Schwab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rising yields snuffed out the tech-led stock market rally yesterday even before Salesforce missed quarterly revenue expectations and sank double-digits," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday also sees the release of the latest eurozone consumer price index, a key release ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on June 6 and which could decide whether the central bank goes ahead and as expected cuts rates by 25 basis points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe's main stock markets closed higher on Thursday, making up some of the losses from the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Thursday, the Sydney stock market closed lower with shares in BHP shedding 1.7 percent after the Australian mining giant ended its US$49-billion takeover bid for British rival Anglo American, whose shares were down five percent in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices fell ahead of this weekend's Opec meeting over concerns about future demand in China and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Oil is on track for its second straight day of falling prices amid softer US growth data ahead of Sunday's Opec+ meeting," said Axel Rudolph, Senior Market Analyst at IG. (AFP)

    Spain parliament passes controversial amnesty bill

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The biggest beneficiary of the amnesty bill will be Carles Puigdemont – the former Catalan leader who fled Spain to avoid prosecution. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755447_1_20240530234022.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's parliament gave the final green light to a controversial amnesty bill for Catalan separatists on Thursday, paving the way for the return of their figurehead Carles Puigdemont after years of self-imposed exile.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislation seeks to draw a line under years of efforts to prosecute those involved in the botched 2017 Catalan independence bid that triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The text, which has been resolutely opposed by Spain's right and far-right opposition, passed by 177 votes in favour to 172 votes against in the 350-seat parliament. One person was absent from the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing the amnesty is a key moment for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as it was a demand made by separatist parties in exchange for their parliamentary support to allow him to serve a new term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, Spain's lower house of parliament passed the bill, which grants an amnesty to hundreds of separatists involved in Catalonia's failed 2017 independence bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It then went to the Senate upper house, which is dominated by the right-wing opposition, where it was symbolically vetoed – as the Senate cannot block a bill, but only propose amendments – before returning to the lower house on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a rowdy two-and-a-half hour debate during which the Speaker was forced to call order several times due to the insults traded on the floor, the bill passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will now be up to individual judges to decide whether the amnesty applies to their cases. They have two months to raise issues with the Constitutional Court or the European justice system which could delay the law's implementation for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest beneficiary will be Puigdemont – the former Catalan leader who led the bid then fled Spain to avoid prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His hardline separatist JxCat and its moderate rival ERC both demanded the amnesty in return for their votes in November that let Sanchez secure another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What opened that door was Spain's inconclusive July 2023 election, which was won by the right-wing Popular Party (PP) but without enough parliamentary support to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With JxCat cast as kingmaker, Sanchez won them over with the promise of an amnesty and returned to office, in a move sparking fierce and unrelenting opposition from the PP and the far-right Vox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have drawn thousands onto the streets in mass protests against the bill that at times turned violent, notably around the Socialists' Madrid headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a PP spokesman said that even after it passes, the party would do everything to "overturn" the law, whether through appeals to the Constitutional Court or "social pressure" on the street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surveys suggest Spaniards are divided over the amnesty, even Sanchez's own Socialists and their supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the outcome of Catalonia's regional election on May 12, in which the Socialists won a clear victory, has shifted the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The separatists lost their absolute majority in the Catalan parliament after 10 years in power, suggesting the focus has shifted away from independence, vindicating Sanchez's strategy of seeking to defuse tensions around the 2017 crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader of the Socialist Party's Catalan branch, Salvador Illa, is hoping to lead the region's new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results show that Catalonia has chosen "the path of forgiveness, giving up any kind of resentment," Sanchez said in Barcelona last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Puigdemont, whose party increased support during the vote and has said he wants to lead a minority separatist administration, is hoping to be home back in time to see a new Catalan government take office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the date has not yet been set, it is expected to take place by June 25 at the latest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is unclear whether that will be possible, given the two month time span for the courts to enact the legislation, which involves releasing those behind bars and cancelling outstanding arrest warrants, including the one for Puigdemont. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull has purchased a minority stake in Leeds United and will become the English second-tier football club's main shirt sponsor next season, it was announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The global drinks brand, best known in sport as the backer of the world champion Formula One team, are already involved with football clubs RB Leipzig, Red Bull Salzburg and New York Red Bulls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thrilled that Red Bull is joining us to build a bright future for Leeds United and shares our deep respect for this truly special club," said United chairman Paraag Marathe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As chairman, our consortium of investment partners will be invaluable to me as we approach this important moment for the club, now and into the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Red Bull's addition is a historic milestone that will further empower the club to reach its full competitive potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds will spend a second consecutive season back in the Championship after losing to Southampton in last Sunday's play-off final at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull chief executive of corporate projects and investments Oliver Mintzlaff said the company hoped to help the Yorkshire club back into the top flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ambition to bring Leeds United back to the Premier League and establish themselves in the best football league in the world fits very well with Red Bull." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and his wife Roh So-young. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755442_1_20240530224208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of South Korea's sprawling SK Group was ordered by a court on Thursday to pay his wife US$1 billion in cash in the country's largest divorce settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court ordered Chey Tae-won to pay Roh So-young, the daughter of former president Roh Tae-woo, 1.38 trillion won as a settlement, court documents showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount was a significant increase from an earlier lower court ruling of 66.5 billion won and takes into account the contributions Roh So-young and her father made to Chey's success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SK Group runs businesses that include South Korea's leading mobile carrier and also controls SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chip maker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was reasonable to rule that, as his wife, Roh played a role in increasing the value of SK Group and Chey's business activity," the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey married Roh So-young in 1988 but they have been separated for years. She appealed against the original settlement amount awarded in 2022, several years after Chey filed for divorce in what has become an acrimonious case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the new settlement also took into account the emotional suffering Roh So-young endured due to Chey's extramarital affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey has a child with his new partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Chey "is not showing any signs of remorse for his foul behaviour in the course of the trial... nor respect for monogamy," ordering him to pay the settlement in cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's net wealth was assessed by the court to be around four trillion won, meaning Roh So-young will take 35 percent of it in the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His legal team said they would lodge an appeal against the latest ruling, claiming the court had "taken Roh's one-sided claim as factual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court said Roh Tae-woo also helped Chey's business flourish during his five years as president from 1988, easing regulatory hurdles for SK's late former chairman Chey Jong-hyon, Chey Tae-won's father.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former president Roh Tae-woo played the role of a protective shield for ex-chairman Chey Jong-hyon" when the late businessman was trying to tap into the mobile carrier business, the court said, giving "intangible help" to the family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's lawyers disagreed, saying SK Group had been under pressure from the Roh government and had "provided various financial contributions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will set things straight through the appeal," they said.

 The Hong Kong government on Thursday said it strongly disapproves of, and condemns all baseless allegations by the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and the European Union (EU) against the city’s homegrown national security law as well as law enforcement action taken by the police’s National Security Department.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The police made seven arrests on Tuesday and Wednesday on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seven were accused of being responsible for seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CECC and EU had described the arrests as a violation of human rights and an attempt to stifle freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a statement published on Thursday, authorities said their claims simply do not stand up to the facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation,” the statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Offences in connection with seditious intention are very serious crimes, and no jurisdictions, including the US and those from the EU, will watch with folded arms acts and activities that endanger national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security, adding that it will not hinder legitimate expression of opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against acts and activities endangering national security. Only invaders who want to intrude into our home to plunder and loot should be worried by the Ordinance,” the statement added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday hit out against foreign criticism of the landmark court ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in the capital, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Beijing strenuously opposes attempts by foreign countries to use this case to interfere in China’s internal affairs and smear Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one can engage in unlawful activities in the name of democracy and then try to escape legal sanctions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokeswoman added that the central government firmly supports the SAR’s law enforcement and judicial authorities in fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that violated national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came after the United States, European Union and Australia described the trial as being "politically motivated", and called for those convicted to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  14 people were convicted earlier in the day of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law, after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by plotting to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two others were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  31 other defendants, meanwhile, had already pleaded guilty in the case.
