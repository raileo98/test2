 Stocks across the region rose again on Tuesday as worries about a US recession that sent markets into turmoil last week eased ahead of key inflation data, while oil prices held gains on concerns about a broader war in the Middle East.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Insurers may not pay out if trips to Japan are cancelled or cut short in the event that a feared "megaquake" in the country actually materialises, an industry representative said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On August 8, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern island of Kyushu, prompting Japanese authorities to issue their first-ever warning of an increased risk of a major quake in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers has urged travellers to carefully study the fine print of their policies, adding that they may not cover disruption linked to a "known risk" such as any further quake connected to the one of last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [insurance] scheme was purchased after the initial earthquake on August 8, then people may not receive compensation if their trip was cancelled or cut short," said the federation's chief executive, Selina Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Hong Kong airport, a man surnamed Lo and his family were checking in for their flight to Tokyo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said they decided to go ahead with the 10-day trip after confirming their travel insurance was still valid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We planned the trip for a very long time. I don't want to disappoint my kids and family. It is a bit risky, but we still want to go," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Yip said she had "no choice" but to go ahead with her trip to Osaka as she did not want to lose the money she paid for the flights and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I booked the trip around five months ago and I could not apply for a refund now," she said, adding that her insurer had reassured her that the trip would still be covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have checked the consulate's phone numbers and if anything happens, I will deal with it when it comes," she said.

    'High interest rates weigh on SMEs confidence'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Senior Standard Chartered economist Kelvin Lau (right) says lingering global uncertainties have affected SME business confidence. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766023_1_20240813172255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Productivity Council on Tuesday warned that a high interest rate environment is putting pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with business confidence among SMEs dropping to the lowest point in two years
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a quarterly survey conducted by the council in July, 56 percent of the 814 local businesses interviewed said high interest rates had affected consumer spending, with the most affected industries being retail, accommodation and food services and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, about one-third of the SMEs interviewed said they had a cash flow or supply chain problem because of the high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said business sentiment among SMEs remained cautious, with the latest Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index recording a decline in confidence to 42.5 points, dropping from 47.3 in the previous quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief innovation officer Lawrence Cheung said 10 of the 11 industries involved in the survey had shown a drop in confidence, with real estate having the lowest score. He said that indicated both external and domestic-oriented sectors were under-performing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Standard Chartered senior economist Kelvin Lau said the survey indicated a lack of confidence among SMEs over the global economic outlook due to external uncertainties lingering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Number one is the possibility of [Donald] Trump coming into office after the US elections in November. And the other being China's recent macro data weakness following its slightly weaker than expected Q2 GDP [growth], which came in at 4.7 percent rather than anything closer to 5 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So overall, it's kind of like a double whammy that the local businesses need to worry about the US and they need to worry about China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he added there are certain bright spots, citing expectations the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates from September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our own view is that we could see a collective 75 basis points of cuts between now and the year-end and possibly even more cuts in the first half of next year, to as much as 125 basis points in total,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So that would hopefully be a lot of relief to the Hong Kong SMEs, in particular the real estate sector, for example, and to some extent the accommodation and food services sector as well.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on low-incomes in Hong Kong are struggling to afford nutritious food and some are having to skip meals altogether due to rising prices, an NGO said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Food Grace said it carried out a survey involving more than 500 underprivileged people in Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po, finding that a third had cut back on the number of meals they ate due to financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of the respondents said that to save money, they either opted for less healthy food or went hungry on occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO described the situation as worrying and urged the government to provide food subsidies to those in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Angela Lo, project manager with the group, said better education on healthy eating would benefit many people who need to cook on a limited budget.

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Tuesday said underprivileged students who are taking part in a government mentorship scheme in Hangzhou have been able to learn a lot about Chinese culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister is leading a delegation taking some 80 teenagers to the mainland city, as part of the Strive and Rise Programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a museum visit, Chan told reporters the teenagers he spoke to have become more confident and pro-active.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last year we began by organising five tours, and the reaction was quite good. Students who joined were all very happy. This year we've increased to 18 tours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, we want to encourage more enterprises and partners to offer us more sponsorships, so we can organise more of these activities that allow children to go on trips and learn more about the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added it's important for the students to gain knowledge from their mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who retired right after her victory at the Paris Games to join the Jockey Club, is also part of the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Strive and Rise Programme was introduced in Chief Executive John Lee's maiden policy address in 2022.

    Officials 'concerned' after hospital drug sold online

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospital bosses have expressed concerns and vowed to take follow-up action after a woman was allegedly sold a medication prescribed by a public hospital from a purchase via HKTVmall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The online shopping site said it had removed the product from its shelves and was investigating the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a photo circulating online, the woman, who was reportedly 38 weeks pregnant at the time of the incident, complained she had placed an order for lactulose, but received the laxative with another patient's name and information indicating it was from Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident came to light on Monday following a post on the online discussion forum LIHKG, with the woman who claimed to be the buyer expressing concern about the quality of the medication and whether it would affect her baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, HKTVmall said the customer reported an issue with the product on July 9 last year, upon receiving the order on May 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the vendor was unable to provide information about the order, given that it had been delivered to her in May 2023, with relevant security camera footage and photos deleted, while the report was filed more than a month after delivery
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site said it had removed the seller from its platform and the vendor must provide valid information of its proof of delivery, HKTVmall added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If violations are found, the vendor will be penalised. In serious cases, we will terminate the contract, and the vendor concerned will have to bear the relevant legal responsibilities," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority, for its part, said it was very concerned about the incident and reminded people not resell or pass the drugs for others' use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials would follow up seriously and refer to law enforcement agencies if any illegal activities were found, the authority added.

    Olympics boost sales at Kwun Tong mall

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds flocking to malls to watch the Paris Olympics boosted footfall, an operator said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties' leasing department said its mall in Kwun Tong saw 20 percent more people compared to the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said this was because social distancing measures were still in place during the Tokyo Games, adding that there was a joyous atmosphere this time due to the success of the SAR and national teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said sales went up significantly at restaurants, as well as stores selling trainers which saw a 20 percent increase in business. She said watching the events inspired people to take up exercise or sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another reason [for increased sales] was that there were breaks between matches, the short ones lasted five to 10 minutes, while long ones could span over half an hour, or one hour. During this period of time, as residents wanted to continue watching the Games, they would wander around and return to the atrium to watch the match after enjoying their meals," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business at eateries rose 15 percent during the Paris Olympics, with people heading to shopping malls to watch the Games, and shops opening much longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said food delivery services also enjoyed a 10 percent growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although there are a lot of people going to spend their time and entertain themselves in the Greater Bay Area, especially in Shenzhen, during the Olympics, I saw that more people stayed in Hong Kong, especially during night-time," Wong told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[For] some people, even though they went to Shenzhen during the day, they rushed back to Hong Kong, just wanting to view the competitions."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A nostalgic Hong Kong mango sago chain is thriving in one of the most unexpected places – Paris, showing that sweet treats can transcend boundaries, cultures and languages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui Lau Shan – a household name for classic Chinese desserts and herbal tea, and famous for its icy mango beverages and desserts – had been a fixture on the streets of Hong Kong since the 1960s, until the last franchised store in the SAR closed in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it is flourishing in the French capital because of a die-hard fan. Xu Xiaofeng brought the franchise to Paris after he developed a love affair with its fruity drinks when he was extremely thirsty one day during a Hong Kong work trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But becoming the owner of the Parisian Hui Lau Shan business was not easy. Xu said it took him three tries to convince the owners to grant him permission to expand the brand in France, where Xu had been an exchange student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the conditions was that he needed to stay true to Hui Lau Shan’s original taste, with the owners sending inspectors to ensure that the taste of the Paris branch matched that of the original back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Europe, people really love eating mangos,” a beaming Xu, wearing an apron and a red baseball cap emblazoned with the brand's logo told RTHK, as he prepared a signature drink by cutting up the fruit and putting it into a food blender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Basically, if there are more than ten tonnes of mangoes a year, Paris would consume more than half of them, so I know there is a good market here,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, they love mangoes very much, and second, many strive for healthy foods, so it was the perfect combination.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said his dessert shops first attracted Chinese customers living in France, but over time, he also won over the French, who he said did have one complaint – that his desserts were not sweet enough compared to local pastries and tarts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To address this, Xu decided to start blending elements from both cultures to bring the two culinary worlds together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think this is an exchange between desserts. For example, our pancakes use French cheese, cream and French Chantilly. This is a good blend. Now, French people are slowly starting to use a lot of fresh fruits to make their own desserts, which I think is a good exchange,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are able to learn from each other. Our desserts aren’t too sweet, but theirs are. With exchange, we can meet in the middle and create something new together.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dutch rider Charlotte Kool kept her head amid a chaotic bunched sprint finish to win the first stage of the women's Tour de France on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It was really hectic but I like it. I kept on thinking 'I like hectic, I like chaos'," said the 25-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I went so early and I thought it's too long and it hurt so bad but it was enough in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kool, born in North Holland, took the yellow jersey on home soil as the women's Tour got underway in the Netherlands with a 123-kilometre flat ride from Rotterdam to The Hague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Topping 60kmh as she crossed the line, the Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL rider claimed her maiden Tour win with an unstoppable surge in the last 100 metres to complete the stage in a time of two hours 47 minutes and 40 seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The armed wing of Palestinian group Hamas said on Monday its militants had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, in two separate incidents in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages during their October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, with 111 of them still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement: "In two separate incidents, two recruits assigned to guard enemy prisoners fired at a Zionist prisoner, killing him immediately, and also injured two female prisoners critically."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement, posted on Telegram, did not identify the hostages or say when or where the incidents occurred, but noted "attempts are being made to save the lives" of the two women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida said Hamas had formed a committee to investigate the shootings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it does "not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas' claims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a televised briefing earlier on Monday, said: "We do not forget for a moment the hostages being cruelly held by Hamas in Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are deeply concerned about their physical and mental condition, given the prolonged time that has passed and the harsh conditions of their captivity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip since then has killed at least 39,897 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Investors are eyeing a report on the consumer price index – a key inflation gauge – due out on Wednesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Results on Wall Street were mixed on Monday, with markets in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the release of US inflation data this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.4 percent to 39,357, while the S&P 500 was flat at 5,344.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq gained 0.2 percent to 16,780.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is another one of these watch-and-wait days," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The volume is not very high," he added, while noting the week ahead would be "busy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In particular, investors are eyeing a report on the consumer price index – a key inflation gauge – due out on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This "should have some effect on how we view the battle against inflation," Sosnick added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start lowering interest rates at its meeting in September, although a weaker than expected labour market report at the start of this month fanned fears surrounding the US economy's health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are monitoring to see if inflation is cooling at a gradual pace – signalling the world's biggest economy is indeed achieving a "soft landing" where price increases ease without a downturn.

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukrainian troops who have crossed the border into its territory will be "dislodged." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765928_1_20240813023744.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his army on Monday to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops who have entered Russian territory as authorities said over 120,000 people had been evacuated away from the fighting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrsky told President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video posted on Monday that his troops now control about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory and are continuing "offensive operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told a televised meeting with government officials that "one of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord" and "destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky told the nation in his evening address that the cross-border offensive was "purely a security issue," capturing "areas from which the Russia army struck at our Sumy region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 121,000 people have fled the Kursk region since the start of the fighting, which has killed at least 12 civilians and injured 121 more, regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the meeting with Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Kursk announced on Monday they were widening their evacuation area to include a district with some 14,000 residents. The neighbouring Belgorod region also said it was evacuating a new border district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has pierced into the region by at least 12 kilometres and has captured 28 towns and villages, with the new front 40 kilometres long, Smirnov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Syrsky said that "as of now, about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory are under control," suggesting the area captured is more than twice as large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that fighting was ongoing along almost the whole front and "the situation is under our control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said Russia would respond by showing "unanimous support for all those in distress" and claimed there had been an increase in men signing up to fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enemy will receive a worthy riposte," he said. (AFP)

    Indonesia president holds meeting in future capital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Monday held his first cabinet meeting in the country's future capital, despite much of the city remaining under construction as it runs behind schedule.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US$32-billion megaproject Nusantara was widely expected to be inaugurated on August 17, Indonesia's Independence Day, but building delays and funding woes have cast doubt on the schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, still hailed the city-in-progress, which is expected to be fully ready in 2045.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not all countries have the opportunity, have the ability to build their capital starting from zero," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Jokowi, the city is "being built with the concept of a forest city, a jungle city, a city full of green" in eastern Borneo island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But environmentalists have warned the rapid development of the new capital will hasten deforestation in one of the world's largest stretches of tropical rainforest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi – who started to work from the future capital several weeks ago – brought dozens of officials to Nusantara for the cabinet meeting, including his successor Prabowo Subianto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo pledged to continue the capital-to-be once he takes office in October, removing any doubt over his willingness to carry out Jokowi's legacy project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi resurrected the long-shelved plan to relocate the capital soon after taking office in 2019 after experts warned Jakarta – the megacity of 12 million people – was sinking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An official decree on moving the capital from Jakarta could be delayed until after Prabowo takes office, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said many times that I am determined to continue, if possible, to complete the project," said Prabowo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe in three, four, five years, the capital city can function."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ground broke on several projects on Monday, including the vice presidential palace and several private buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nusantara has struggled to attract crucial foreign investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jakarta will fund 20 percent of Nusantara and hopes to secure 100 trillion rupiah (US$6.13 billion) in private investment by the end of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as of Monday, Jokowi said it had received only 56.2 trillion rupiah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government aims to have 1.9 million people living in Nusantara by 2045. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Atletico Madrid signed striker Julian Alvarez from Manchester City on Monday in a deal reported to be worth up to 85 million euros (US$93 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The club has reached an agreement with Manchester City for the transfer of the Argentine forward, who has signed a contract for the next six seasons," said Atletico in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish reports say Atletico will pay 75 million euros for the forward, with potentially 10 million more in bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old arrived at City for just £14 million (16 million euros) in January 2022 from River Plate, winning two Premier League trophies and the Champions League among other silverware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez also helped Argentina lift the World Cup trophy in December 2022 and the Copa America in 2021 and 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I say goodbye to this amazing club, with a lot of emotion," Alvarez told City's club website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These have been two very special years. During this time, I have grown and learnt a lot – both as a player and as a person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez scored 36 goals for City in 103 appearances across all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's incredibly loved by the team for his behaviour but like I said many times for many players, he wants to leave and have a new challenge," said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diego Simeone's Atletico have also signed Robin Le Normand and Alexander Sorloth as they reinforce heavily to compete with Real Madrid and Barcelona, following a disappointing fourth-place La Liga finish last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Atletico begin the new campaign with a visit to face Villarreal on August 19. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive wildfire blazed its way into Athens' northeastern suburbs on Monday as hundreds of firefighters battled to contain it, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes and sparking a Greek government appeal for international help.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In scenes never before seen in the Greek capital, residents wearing masks against the choking smoke were desperately dousing their homes with water hoses in the leafy suburbs of Nea Penteli and Vrilissia in an effort to render them less vulnerable to fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television footage showed several cars in both areas gutted by fire and the roofs of stately homes burning as water-bombing helicopters roared overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation is dramatic," Penteli mayor Natassa Kosmopoulou told news portal newsit.gr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A school and homes are on fire, and I can see the fire coming towards the town hall," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece on Monday formally called for EU assistance, a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU civil protection mechanism was activated upon request of the Greek authorities," EU spokesman Balazs Ujvari said in a statement, adding that Italy, France, the Czech Republic and Romania were sending units to help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Paris was sending 180 firefighters, 55 trucks and a helicopter to assist their hard-pressed Greek colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wildfire started on Sunday afternoon in the town of Varnavas, some 35 kilometres northeast of Athens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aided by strong winds, it grew to a 30-kilometre long frontline of fires, more than 25 metres high in places, according to state TV ERT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 700 firefighters with 190 fire engines and over 30 aircraft sought to contain it, but it scaled Mount Pentelicon, which looms over the Greek capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several large Athens municipalities ordered partial evacuations, including Penteli, Vrilissia and Halandri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of the direction of the wind we have decided on a precautionary evacuation," Halandri mayor Simos Roussos told ERT. "The fire is very close."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities opened the Olympic stadium in northern Athens and other stadiums to house thousands of people evacuated from the path of the blaze. Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a biblical catastrophe," said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. "Our whole town is engulfed in flames," he told the Skai television channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said. Another hospital was evacuated during the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The destruction revived memories of the Mati disaster, the coastal area near Marathon where 104 people died in July 2018 in a tragedy later blamed on evacuation delays and errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summer wildfire season in Greece this year has seen dozens of daily blazes after the Mediterranean country recorded its warmest winter and the hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures around Athens were forecast to peak at 39 degrees Celsius on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 50 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias issued a warning on Saturday that half the country faced a high risk of fires due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday he said that a fire that broke out on Sunday near the town of Varnavas had spread even though a water-bombing aircraft reached the area within five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working 24-hour shifts, all of us," said fireman Marinos Peristeropoulos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fire spread very quickly because of the strong wind," he said near one of the hotspots in Grammatiko.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parts of Europe are also struggling with high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of France rose above 40 Celsius on Sunday. In Rome, temperatures were expected to reach 38 Celsius Monday and remain around 36 Celsius this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, temperatures between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius are expected. (AFP)

    Ex-Olympic diving champion Tom Daley retires

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tom Daley, (right), who won silver in Paris with Noah Williams, says he now wants to spend time with his husband and two children. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765919_1_20240812232925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Olympic gold medallist Tom Daley said on Monday it was the "right time" to retire as Britain's most successful diver walked away from the sport following the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Daley, who won five Olympic medals during his decorated career, revealed the decision to call time on the sport during an interview with British Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old bowed out after winning silver in the Olympic men's synchronised 10m platform in France, having clinched the gold medal in the same event at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to make the decision at some point, and it feels like the right time. It's the right time to call it a day," Daley said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley emerged as the star of British diving after first competing at the Olympics in the 2008 Beijing Games aged just 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London in the 10m platform, as well as bronze in the men's synchronised 10m platform in Rio 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley had effectively retired after his gold medal success in Tokyo, before deciding to return for a fifth Olympics in Paris in order to compete in front of his two children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He decided ahead of the event that he would stop diving competitively once he stepped out of the pool in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels very, very surreal. I felt so incredibly nervous going into this, knowing it was my last Olympics," he told Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was a lot of pressure and expectations. I was eager for it to be done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But when I walked out, and saw my husband (Lance) and kids (Robbie and Phoenix) and my friends and family in the audience, I was like, you know what? This is exactly why I did this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was emotional at the end, up there on the platform, knowing it was going to be my last competitive dive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley's gold in Tokyo came alongside Matty Lee and he was back to defend his title in Paris after being convinced by his six-year-old son Robbie to return to the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley and partner Noah Williams claimed silver in the competition, finishing behind China a fortnight ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking forward to spending more time with his family away from the Olympic spotlight, Daley has no fears he will regret retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to be with my family. I'm really excited to be able to spend some time with them and just be able to feel a bit normal for a couple of days," said Daley, who fulfilled a childhood dream by becoming the first diver to be a British flag bearer in the Olympic opening ceremony in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's always hard when you say goodbye to your sport. Lots of things to process, but I think it's the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year felt like such a bonus and I got to compete in front of my family, my kids. I got to be a flag bearer. So yeah, bucket list ticked off on every occasion." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan is on a visit to Hangzhou. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765914_1_20240812215848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Monday said the government is considering loosening the eligibility criteria of one of its talent schemes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, people who graduated from the top 100 universities or institutions in designated world rankings can apply for a work visa in Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in Hangzhou, Chan said the government is reviewing the scheme to possibly include more universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are some universities whose subjects may not be in the top 100 in the world, yet they are popular and very good. We are currently reviewing the scheme to see if these universities should be added to the scheme," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can never have too many talent. The more talent there are, the more useful they will be to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan is joining a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme visiting the capital of Zhejiang province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have participated in quite a lot of activities under the programme, but all of them were held in Hong Kong," he said during the welcoming dinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is also my first time to leave Hong Kong with our fellow students for the mainland. I am looking forward to visiting Hangzhou Branch of the National Archives of Publications and Culture with you all tomorrow, to learn about the rich history of our country and Zhejiang."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan will also meet with leaders of Hangzhou and Zhejiang to discuss deepening cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy mayor of Hangzhou, Xu Weihua, highlighted Hong Kong's role as Hangzhou's largest source of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As of the end of last year, Hong Kong companies had invested in 8,278 projects in Hangzhou, with a total investment of US$256.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are 56 businesses from Hangzhou that are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In fact, it's not an easy feat. There are 305 publicly listed companies in Hangzhou in total, and one-sixth of them are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said he hopes more reciprocal visits between Hangzhou and Hong Kong would take place, and the two cities would explore deeper collaboration and exchanges in areas such as trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said the five-day trip will be a very valuable experience for the youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who's now an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club, is also taking part in the trip.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Macau government said the SAR's chief executive election will be held on October 13.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, voting was held for Election Committee members, with more than 5,500 people choosing 344 out of 348 candidates. Turnout was 88.12 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau lawmakers and deputies to the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are among the other 56 Election Committee members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They form a 400-member Election Committee that will be responsible for nominating and electing the new-term chief executive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incumbent Ho Iat-seng has not indicated yet if he will seek re-election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the law, the Macau chief executive must be a Chinese citizen who is a permanent resident of the SAR, at least 40 years old, has ordinarily resided in Macau for a continuous period of 20 years, supports the Basic Law, and is loyal to the People's Republic of China and the Macau SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday urged all sides in the Ukraine war to de-escalate as Kyiv's forces pierced deep into Russia's Kursk border region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault seemed to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army on Sunday appearing to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the offensive, Beijing on Monday urged all parties to follow "three principles for de-escalating the situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those are "no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fuelling the flame by any party", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China will continue to maintain communication with the international community and play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the crisis," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing released a paper last year calling for a political settlement to the conflict. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday urged Hongkongers in Japan to be careful after the country's authorities warned a "megaquake" was possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japanese officials issued their first ever megaquake advisory last Thursday after a 7.1-magnitude quake hit the south of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR administration said Hongkongers in Japan should exercise caution, attend to their personal safety and pay attention to announcements on the latest situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation. It urged any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or the Chinese Embassy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested a 27-year-old man after finding more than 200 kilogrammes of cocaine in a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the haul has a street value of HK$175 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrest was made in Lok Ma Chau on Saturday and officers said the suspect is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said the flat where the drugs were found had recently been rented out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would like to make an appeal here, especially to large property owners. If they notice potential tenants who seem extremely eager to rent these units or even request renting immediately after a quick look around, they should be extra cautious and pay attention to their backgrounds," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Monday said six people have died and 10 others were injured after a lightning strike caused a park pavilion to collapse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People were seeking shelter from the rain under the pavilion in the city of Changzhou in Jiangsu province on Sunday night when lightning struck the structure, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Search and rescue efforts went late into the night, with all 16 people rushed to the hospital, but six of them who suffered severe injuries later died despite extensive rescue efforts. The rest of them are in stable condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported that authorities there will conduct a comprehensive review of public facilities to ensure safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains across the east and south, and much of the north sweltering in successive heat waves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, heavy rain in Shaanxi province caused a highway bridge to collapse, killing at least 38 people. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    DAB calls for register of subdivided units

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday urged the government to set up a system to register subdivided flats in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as the government is preparing a report on ways to address substandard accommodation, including setting minimum standards for subdivided units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB members visited more than 20 subdivided flats as part of a study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party is proposing that subdivided flats should have a minimum area of seven square metres and a minimum height of 1.8 metres and must comply with building and fire safety regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said that for safety reasons, the kitchen and bathroom in these flats should be separate, adding that the government should prioritise eliminating unsafe subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen quite a lot of fire accidents, some of the poor subdivided units don't have windows and fire protection... this makes it quite dangerous for the people who live inside," said lawmaker Vincent Cheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also says residents of units deemed to be unacceptable should be provided with rehousing options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [residents] live in a very poor subdivided unit, they can choose to move into transitional housing," said Cheng.

    Pest that strips trees bare now on HK Island: expert

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pest which ravages the leaves of trees like the Chinese banyan leaving them bare is increasing being found on Hong Kong Island after spreading from other parts of the territory in the hot weather, an expert warned on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Larvae of the Phauda flammans moth feed on the leaves of ficus trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The insect was a rare sight in the SAR until around 2019 when it appeared in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, according to Ken So, chief executive of The Conservancy Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the number of trees on Hong Kong Island affected by the pest is increasing, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For insects, because the life cycle can be shortened or the reproduction of insects can always be affected by weather conditions, particularly talking about the temperature. Higher temperatures would favour the reproduction or growth of insects. So likely, the problem of Phauda flammans is highly related to hotter weather," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said pesticides can be used to control the insect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the larvae eat the leaves with pesticides, then it will kill the larvae, so that it stops or terminates the life cycle of the insects," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So added that professionals are also developing a trap specifically for Phauda flammans.

    Top court dismisses appeal over 2019 assembly case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two of the appellants, Margaret Ng (left) and Martin Lee (right), attended the hearing at the Court of Final Appeal. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765839_1_20240812115111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has unanimously dismissed a final attempt by Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers to overturn their convictions for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai, Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the procession on August 18, which followed an approved anti-police demonstration led by the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a lower court earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, it upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final appeal had centred on the issue of "operational proportionality", a principle set out by two decisions of Britain's Supreme Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appellants argued that the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, and that a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But judges at the Court of Final Appeal on Monday rejected the argument that the arrest, prosecution, conviction and sentence must be separately justified as proportionate, saying a separate proportionality inquiry was "inappropriate and uncalled for".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defendants' convictions and consequent sentences do not stand alone. They are the result of the judge applying the law to the evidence and being satisfied individually of their guilt," the ruling said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The same pertains to the defendants' proposition in respect of arrest and prosecution. Those actions similarly do not occur in isolation. They represent steps taken to enforce particular offence-creating laws."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the presiding judges, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung and Roberto Ribeiro, said the two British legal precedents cited by the appellants "should not be followed in Hong Kong" because of differences between the two jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, statutory and other provisions which are found to be unconstitutional may be struck down as invalid whereas in the UK, a provision that is declared to be incompatible continues to be enforced as a valid law, with potentially different issues regarding proportionality arising thereafter," the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow justice Johnson Lam added that there is no basis in the SAR to consider the prosecution, conviction and sentence as "distinct, standalone restrictions" from the rule creating the offence relating to freedom of assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord David Neuberger of Abbotsbury, a non-permanent judge from Britain, said the constitutional differences in Hong Kong and the UK "do not mandate a different approach when it comes to considering whether a restriction on the freedom of assembly is proportionate", but they "do require a different approach if the court concludes that the restriction is not proportionate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who attended the hearing, said it was not appropriate to comment on the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't had a chance to look at this very important judgement. This is not the right time to make comments. We just want to take this occasion to thank our legal teams and all the people who have been supporting us all the time," she said outside the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, left the court saying he had "no comment".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Space Museum says the Perseid meteor shower will peak before dawn on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual meteor shower has been active since last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Chiu from the museum said around 100 meteors per hour are expected between 11:30pm on Monday and 5am on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said Clear Water Bay will be one of the best locations for seeing them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the weather is suitable for watching, we would suggest people go to the extremely dark and also the wide sky area to watch the meteor shower. And the suggested area that's actually in the kite-flying area, Tai Mei Tuk and Clear Water Bay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu also said the museum will livestream the meteor shower on its YouTube channel, while offering insights into the astronomical aspects of the shooting stars.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Just opposite the fencing stadium, the Grand Palais on the Avenue des Champs Élysées, scores of tourists have been queuing up outside the largest Olympic merchandise store to take home a taste of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paris 2024 megastore offers a variety of souvenirs, from 5 euro pens and bracelets, to giant mascots costing 800 euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekday visitors have had to wait around 15 minutes to get inside the store, but most RTHK spoke to said it was worth queuing up for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adam, a UK tourist in Paris with his kids, bought a T-shirt, a hat, a poster and some badges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We spent about 110 euros, which I think, as it's only every four years, it's something to remember the Games by, so I think it's okay every once in a while,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic mascot “Phryge”, a little red hat symbolising French liberty, is one of the bestsellers at the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas from Hong Kong bought one because he wanted something special to take home with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s unique and it's like representing the culture and France and also it represents the spirit of the Olympics, so we're trying to look for something very unique for a gift,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to the French capital can also take home the smell of a fresh baguette, with the launch of scratch-and-sniff stamps by the French postal service La Poste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's to celebrate the baguette, which is one of the symbols of France for the tourists for them to enjoy and to share this with the people they live with abroad,” said Gaspard, a worker at the Olympic Village’s post office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French baguette was given Unesco heritage status in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell on Sunday became the first LIV Golf player to be suspended under its anti-doping policy for using an over-the-counter decongestant that contained a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2010 US Open champion used a decongestant at LIV's June event in Nashville that contained the banned substance levo-methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDowell posted on social media that he was struggling with severe congestion that affected his sleep prior to the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi-funded league said McDowell would be suspended for one tournament and fined US$125,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will be replaced in the field at the LIV Golf Greenbrier next week by an alternate. (AFP/AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes was helped off the field after suffering an injury while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred domestic cricket competition on Sunday, raising concerns he could miss the upcoming test series against Sri Lanka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Stokes pulled up while running between the wickets as the Superchargers chased a victory target of 153 against Manchester Originals at Old Trafford. Stokes appeared to clutch his left hamstring as he was completing a quick single from the non-striker’s end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes, who had bowled 15 overs in the match, retired hurt on two runs with England teammate Harry Brook coming out to replace him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes led England to a 3-0 series sweep against West Indies last month. England opens its test series against Sri Lanka next Wednesday at Old Trafford, with the third and final test at the Oval from September 6. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris said a triumphant "au revoir" to the Olympics on Sunday as the curtain came down on its widely praised staging of the global sporting spectacular.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A star-studded closing ceremony took place in front of around 71,500 spectators at the Stade de France to crown an event that has been broadly acclaimed as one of the greatest editions of the Olympics ever held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 270 artists performed in the packed arena for an estimated 9,000 athletes who marched into the venue as the festivities got into full swing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening segment of the ceremony festivities began with France's swimming hero Leon Marchand -- winner of four gold medals at these Games -- gathering the Olympic flame from the cauldron in the centre of Paris to begin its journey to the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rugby hero Antoine Dupont -- who led the host nation to a rugby sevens gold medal in one of the early highlights of the Games -- carried a tricolore flag into the Stade de France as partying athletes swarmed the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show included a theatrical sequence entitled "Records", which was a dream-like immersive journey through time, led by a "Golden Voyager".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musicians Phoenix then entertained the crowd with a series of hits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach hailed the Paris Games as "sensational".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish - or dare I say, Seine-sational Games," Bach said in a speech at the closing ceremony, in a reference to the river which staged the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the Los Angeles Olympics, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed to the Californian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then it was time for Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise to jump from the roof of the Stade de France into the closing ceremony before speeding off with the Olympic flag in a dramatic handover that began the anticipation for the Games in 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A beaming Cruise high-fived athletes after making the roughly 160-foot descent before jumping on a motorcycle and exiting the stadium as the crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Living up to the stunning success of the Paris Games may seem like mission impossible for LA and the celebrity-rich city will lean on its stars such as leading man Cruise as the Olympic spotlight turns to Southern California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise was among the many celebrities seen taking in the action at the Paris Games, showing up at gymnastics, swimming and soccer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, Yseult, a French R&B singer, performed "Comme d’habitude," the song famously adapted into "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A dazzling festival of sport in Paris officially ended on Day 16 as the 2024 Olympics concluded with a spectacular closing ceremony. The baton has been passed to Los Angeles, which hosts the Games in 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US edged out France in the last event of the day in women's basketball to claim their 40th gold medal in Paris. China also won a 40th gold in women's weightlifting, but the Americans end the Games ahead of the national team due to the fact they won 44 silvers compared with China's 27. Japan finished third while hosts France were fifth. Still, China's 40 golds is its second highest ever after the Beijing Olympics of 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong China's Ceci Lee was bidding for a medal in the women's omnium, but it wasn't to be. The SAR finished 37th in the table with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here are some of the highlights on the last day of the Olympic Games in Paris.

       The United States held off France 67-66 to win an unprecedented eighth successive women's Olympic basketball gold on Sunday and extend their run of victories at the tournament to 61 games.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A'ja Wilson scored a game-high 21 points for the Americans who won the title for the 10th time overall, surviving a buzzer-beating shot from France's Gabby Williams.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The hosts needed a three to force overtime but Williams' foot was on three-point line as she let go off the ball, so her shot counted for just two points in a dramatic finale.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nineteen people including five children are confirmed dead after a landslide at a huge garbage dump in the Ugandan capital Kampala, a senior official said on Sunday, amid claims the site was a disaster waiting to happen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local media said homes, people and livestock were buried in mountains of waste at the landfill in the northern Kampala district of Kiteezi on Saturday after a collapse caused by heavy downpours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Yoweri Museveni said he had directed the army's special forces to help in the search and rescue operation and demanded to know who allowed people to live near such a "potentially hazardous and dangerous heap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area's resident commissioner Yasin Ndide said after visiting the scene of the disaster that the death toll was now 19, including five children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rescue mission is ongoing but with little hope of finding more survivors," he said, adding that local authorities were setting up temporary shelters for those affected by the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndide blamed the "encroachment" of local people who had breached the perimeter fence and settled on the site for the loss of life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala's metropolitan police spokesman Patrick Onyango had earlier told reporters at the scene that 14 bodies had been recovered on Saturday, and another four on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Onyango also said that 14 people had been rescued, while an estimated 1,000 were displaced and that the police were working with other government agencies and community leaders to see how to help those affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala mayor Erias Lukwago said that "many, many more could be still buried in the heap as the rescue operation is ongoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described it as a "national disaster," blaming corrupt officials who he said had been syphoning off money that should have been used to maintain the landfill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Museveni said in a statement posted on X that he had ordered payments to the victims' families of five million Ugandan shillings (US$1,300) for each fatality and one million shillings (US$270) for each injured person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for an investigation into how people were allowed to live so close to the site and ordered the removal of all those living in the "danger zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excavators were still churning through huge mounds of rubbish on Sunday as crowds of local residents looked on, some wailing in despair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukwago had on Saturday raised concerns about the safety of the 36-acre (14-hectare) landfill which was established in 1996 and takes in almost all garbage collected across Kampala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a disaster and was bound to happen as the landfill was full to capacity," he said, adding that it received about 1,500 tonnes of waste a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, Lukwago had warned that people working and living near the site were at risk of numerous health hazards due to overflowing waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several areas in Uganda and other parts of East Africa have been battered by heavy rains recently, including Ethiopia, the second most populous country on the continent. (AFP)

    Hamas tells Gaza mediators to go with Biden truce plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People inspect the damage in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood after it was destroyed by Israeli bombs on Sunday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday called on US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to implement a ceasefire plan for Gaza put forward by US President Joe Biden, instead of holding "more negotiations."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas "demands that the mediators present a plan to implement what they proposed to the movement... based on Biden's vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and compel the occupation (Israel) to comply, rather than going through more negotiation rounds or new proposals," the Palestinian group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators have invited both Israel and Hamas for a round of negotiations on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, shortly after the killing of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Israel agreed to a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks to facilitate the release of hostages still held in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the killing of Haniyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several rounds of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed until now, except for a one-week truce that was observed at the end of November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That truce saw the release of scores of hostages in exchange of dozens of Palestinians prisoners who were held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 31, Biden unveiled what he said was a three-stage plan for a ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plan includes a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, with Israeli forces withdrawing from "all populated areas of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "a number" of hostages captured in the October 7 attacks, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The remains of some hostages who had been killed would also be returned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their "homes and neighbourhoods" throughout Gaza, including in the north, which has been devastated by months of Israeli bombing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the initial six-week period, Israel and Hamas would "negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceasefire would also be extended if the negotiations continue, with mediators working to ensure they continue, Biden said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In phase two, also lasting around another six weeks, Israeli forces would completely withdraw from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "all remaining living hostages" including male Israeli soldiers. This has been a key sticking point for Hamas in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If both sides keep to the deal it will lead to the "cessation of hostilities permanently," Biden said, quoting what he said had been an Israeli proposal.

  <br/>
  In the third and final stage, a major reconstruction and stabilisation plan for Gaza would begin, backed by the US and the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 Hamas attacks resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,790 people, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday acknowledged Ukrainian forces had pierced deep into the Kursk border region in an offensive that a top official in Ukraine said was aimed to "destabilise" Russia and "stretch" its armed forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border," the security official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock assault, now in its sixth day, appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army rushing in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash the incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But its army on Sunday appeared to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a daily briefing on the situation in the western Kursk region, the defence ministry said it had "foiled attempts" by Ukraine's forces to "break through deep into Russian territory" using armoured vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said some of those forces were located near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian official also said Russia's claims that Kyiv had deployed 1,000 troops were a serious underestimation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a lot more... Thousands," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After days of official silence, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the offensive for the first time in his nightly address on Saturday, saying that Kyiv was "pushing the war into the aggressor's territory."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022 and has waged an unrelenting campaign, occupying swathes of the east and south and subjecting Ukrainian cities to daily missile and drone attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After re-capturing large areas in 2022, Kyiv has largely been on the back foot, increasingly struggling with manpower and arms supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault on Russia's western Kursk region has been the largest and most successful cross-border offensive by Kyiv so far – and the most significant attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has used air power, artillery fire and drones in a bid to quash the advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said on Saturday that more than 76,000 civilians had been evacuated from border areas, with more leaving on Sunday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu will be awarded the Olympic floor exercise bronze medal, after it was taken away from her following an appeal from the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Olympic Committee made the announcement on Sunday, one day after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the request by the American team to re-evaluate Jordan Chiles' score was lodged four seconds after the one-minute deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review, which went ahead at the time, upgraded Chiles to bronze from fifth, behind Brazil's winner Rebeca Andrade and fellow US gymnast Simone Biles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was a devastating blow for Barbosu, who thought she had bagged bronze and was already celebrating with the Romanian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can barely express my emotions, I can't believe it," Barbosu said after learning she was awarded her country's only gymnastics medal in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A devastated Chiles took to Instagram, posting four broken hearts, adding: "I am taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who trains with Chiles, and won team gold with her in Paris, added: "Sending you so much love Jordan. Keep your chin up Olympic champ! We love you!" (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Two migrants die trying to cross Channel to Britain

    <![CDATA[<img alt="So far this year 25 migrants have died trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765786_1_20240812001833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead," the maritime authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death toll this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket," on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to a tally of British government figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday congratulated the SAR's athletes for their achievements at the Paris Olympics, noting it was the first time that Team Hong Kong, China had won more than one gold medal at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Golds from foil fencer Edgar Cheung and épée fencer Vivian Kong, as well as two swimming bronzes from Siobhan Haughey, put the SAR 37th in the medals table, which is the city's highest ever ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Hong Kong athlete has given their utmost and unleashed their full potential in the Olympic arena. In spite of the results, all athletes have fully exhibited their determination, perseverance and will, demonstrating their professional attitude and sportsmanship," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of Hong Kong and I are deeply inspired and moved. The people of Hong Kong are proud of the high level of performance shown by Hong Kong athletes, and each and every one of them is a hero in our hearts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the government would provide more sporting facilities, such as converting an existing sports centre into a dedicated fencing venue, and speeding up a study on building a fencing arena and a swimming pool which can host international competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the current financial year, the administration had provided more than HK$940 million in funding to the Sports Institute through the Elite Athletes Development Fund, around a 40 percent increase from five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said with the Paris Paralympic Games later this month and Hong Kong co-hosting the National Games next year, he's confident that society would continue to support the SAR's athletes to shine and "demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Hong Kong".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For the second consecutive day, the United States silenced the home crowd in Paris as their women's basketball team narrowly edged their French counterparts, 67-66, in a gripping gold medal match to notch an eighth straight Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both teams struggled to find the basket in an unusually low-scoring first half, which ended 25-all. France shot 28 percent from the field, compared to 29 percent for Team USA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts then brought the crowd on their feet, after starting the second half on a 10-0 run to go 35-25 up for their biggest lead of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that advantage did not last, as the Americans finally broke out of a funk and scored 16 of the next 21 points to go back on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides exchanged leads in the fourth quarter, but the Americans held on to their slim edge to win by the finest of margins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Down by three with 3.8 seconds left, France could have sent the game into overtime with a three. But Gabby Williams stepped inside the three-point line as she hoisted - and made - a two-point shot as time expired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia earlier beat Belgium 85-81 in the bronze medal match, returning to the podium for the first time since London 2012.

    In TV interview, Biden brands Trump a 'danger' to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden made the claim in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765781_1_20240811234132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since dropping out of the White House race, warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mark my words, if he wins... this election, watch what happens," Biden told CBS News in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's a genuine danger to American security. Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since withdrawing after his flailing debate performance against Trump underlined fears about his age and mental abilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week, he appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining his exit, he said other Democratic Party politicians standing for re-election feared he would damage their chances – and added that his only priority was to stop Trump from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A critical issue for me still is – not a joke – maintaining this democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is – we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery – and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's age had come to dominate the 2024 campaign, and the Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since his exit, as Harris has enjoyed a surge in support that has left Trump struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to stay on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth, but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's light campaign schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, JD Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about white supremacist attacks on his family, child care, asylum seekers and abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK on Sunday co-hosted a show with the public broadcaster in Indonesia at the Victoria Park, where the audience was treated to performances from local and Indonesian singers and dancers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indonesian singer Nabilla Gomes flew in to perform live at "RTHK Summer POP UP", and she was joined on stage by Hong Kong singer Lagchun, Indonesian-Hong Kong singer-songwriters and dance groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event aimed to foster bond among people from the two places, which is among cooperation priorities of China's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In February, RTHK signed a memorandum of understanding with the Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) to strengthen cooperation, jointly producing a radio programme, "Halo Jakarta! Hello Hong Kong!", in Bahasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme was broadcast on both stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Director of Broadcasting, Eddie Cheung, noted that Sunday's event was a celebration of Indonesia’s Independence Day, as it allowed the programme to go outdoors for greater interaction with the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The event shows that Hong Kong is an open and inclusive society," he said while giving a speech at the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through joint programmes and events, the two broadcasters show how to put people-to-people bond under the Belt and Road Initiative into practice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, the Indonesian Consul-General, Yul Edison, said the media have a growing importance in today's world in connecting people, combating stereotypes and addressing misinformation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jennifer Valente of the United States on Sunday retained her Olympic title in the women’s omnium at the Paris Games while the SAR's Ceci Lee finished 20th.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That concluded Hong Kong, China's participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente ended with 144 points in the multi-race event, consisting of the scratch, tempo, elimination and points races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland’s Daria Pikulik took silver while Ally Wollaston of New Zealand rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first scratch race, cyclists were ranked and awarded points by the order they finished the 30-lap event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente was off to a strong start and finished first, earning the maximum 40 points, with Canada’s Maggie Coles-Lyster and Georgia Baker of Australia coming from behind to grab second and third respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, making her Olympic debut, came 19th among the 22 riders to earn four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist moved up to 18th overall after the second tempo race, where the top contestant per lap was awarded a point from the fifth lap forward while 20 points were given for lapping an opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland’s Lara Gillespie came out on top in this race but Valente maintained her overall lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old SAR athlete earned 16 points by finishing 13th, giving her 20 points at the end of the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the elimination round, the last cyclist of every other lap was knocked out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente won this round as well to continue to top the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, was the fifth athlete eliminated and ended up with six points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final points race, points were awarded to the top four athletes for every 10 laps in the gruelling 80-lap race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist finished near the bottom of the pack in the race that was won by Poland’s Pikulik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, a tearful Lee described her performance as "very poor", saying she felt she let many people down, including her coaches, teammates and the former top SAR cyclist Sarah Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like in the past, I did very poorly in the scratch race, and I couldn't change that today," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though Sarah Lee very diligently tried to pass on her experience to me before the race, I still did very poorly. Coaches and teammates spent a lot of time training with me for the omnium, but I still raced very poorly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had said she hoped to finish in the top 10 overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee, who won silver at the Asian Games last year, added that her Paris experience allowed her to get a taste of just how good the world's finest cyclists are. She also said she hopes to work hard in future to improve her fitness and use of tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's cycling team head coach, Herve Dagorne, said while he could understand her frustrations, he felt she could have been more aggressive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the ominum, and the last event is the points race. You need to score points, so if you don't try, you don't get it, it will not come from the sky," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can understand it's disappointing... I wish she could have attacked more in the points race, like the Japanese did and the French did. They gained a lap, [scoring] 20 points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation earned a total of four medals in Paris: golds for fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung, and two bronzes from swimming star Siobhan Haughey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung will be the flagbearers for the SAR at the closing ceremony.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Weightlifter Li Wenwen on Sunday won China's 40th gold at the Paris Olympics, finishing first in the women’s +81kg category.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li lifted a combined 309kg at the South Paris Arena, 10kg more than South Korea’s Park Hye-jeong in second place and 21kg more than American Emily Campbell, who took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese weightlifter checked off with 136kg in the snatch, 5kg more than Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li then raised 173kg overhead with relative ease in the clean and jerk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having already won the race, she ditched the third lift and instead picked up her coach to celebrate on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, a two-time world champion, topped the podium in Tokyo three years ago in the women’s +87kg class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old holds the world and Olympic records for the women’s highest weightlifting category.

 Weightlifting champion Li Fabin and women's hockey team captain Ou Zixia will be the flagbearers for China in the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, 31, is a Tokyo Olympic champion who successfully defended his title in the men's 61kg weightlifting category at the Paris Games on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He performed consistently in the snatch, ultimately lifting 143kg to secure first place and set a new Olympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also holds the Olympic records for the clean and jerk and total weight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being chosen as a flagbearer is something I never even dared to imagine. I am incredibly excited and proud. This is a high recognition of the Chinese weightlifting team and the glory earned through the hard work of generations of weightlifters. I am extremely honoured to carry this responsibility," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ou led the women's hockey team to the Olympic final on Friday, where they lost to the Netherlands 3-1 in the penalty shootout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The silver medal matched the best Olympic result in history for the Chinese women's hockey team. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they have arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they confiscated 34kg of suspected methamphetamine and 1kg of ketamine, with a total street value of HK$18.5 million, in a Cheung Sha Wan flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police discovered that this drug-trafficking syndicate was renting an upscale private residential flat as a warehouse and a distribution centre for drugs. They took advantage of the low foot traffic and heavy security in an attempt to evade law enforcement," inspector Chang Yuen-lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police urge property owners to check the backgrounds of potential tenants such as occupation, income verification and the intended use of the rented unit before renting them out, so as to prevent their properties from being misused by criminals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect is set to appear in court on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands won Olympic women's marathon gold in Paris on Sunday in a thrilling sprint finish.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hassan traded elbows with Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia with 150 metres left, then passed her along the railing to win the race for her third distance medal of the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hassan finished in an Olympic record time of 2 hours, 22 minutes, 55 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also won bronze in the 5,000m and 10,000m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assefa finished 3 seconds behind Hassan to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya’s Hellen Obiri took the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopian-born Hassan lingered behind the leaders for the bulk of the race before summoning up the energy for a late-race kick that will go down as one of the best the sport has seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been impossible to call with all the favourites among a leading pack up until the last 10km.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three runners from China took part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang Deshun finished 59th in a time of 2:36.47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xia Yuyu was 72nd and Bai Li 76th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking from tradition, the women’s Olympic marathon was held on the final day instead of the men’s race. (Agencies)

    HKers putting rope skipping on the map in Paris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The rope skipping team is among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform in Paris. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765737_2_20240811161208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Olympic delegation isn’t the only team representing the SAR in Paris – the city’s rope skipping performance squad is also in the French capital to push for their sport to be included in future editions of the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rope skipping troupe is amping up the atmosphere at the Paris Games by performing at the Place de la Concorde, which has become the heart of urban sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time in history, various urban disciplines, such as 3x3 basketball, street and park skateboarding, BMX freestyle and breaking, have been grouped together at one site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though these sports have increasingly been adopted in the past two Games, there are those, like rope skipping, that still have not made their way to the Olympic stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's what the Hong Kong Rope Skipping Association, China, is hoping to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform at the open stage of Parc Urbain to promote urban culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tina Wong, the association's chairperson, said performing in Paris is an opportunity they could not pass up, even though the Games conflicted with the jump rope Asian Championships in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are here on the Olympic platform. We actually have the goal or you could say dream to have jump rope skipping to be included in the Olympics in 2032 in Australia because Australia is one the strongest countries in this sport. This is a more long-term goal. On a short-term basis, we are aiming for Asia,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually last year, the Olympic Council of Asia has already granted rope skipping the provisional membership, so meaning we are already included in Asia. This year, we are here. Next year, we are aiming to go to the Youth Asian Games and pave the way for the Asian Games and then the Olympics. We hope with more support, we can officially be on the Olympic stage soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four athletes from the SAR have made their way to Paris to perform, including 18-year-old Yuen Hiu-tung, who said that the atmosphere was unbelievable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s like a dream to come here because even though we paid to come here, it’s a very valuable experience for us because we don’t know when jump rope can get into [the] Olympics, so it is a good experience to promote jump rope, and also letting everyone know how is jump rope [works] and how everyone is enjoying this sport,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The honorary secretary general of Hong Kong's top sports body, Edgar Yang, on Sunday said the city should nurture all athletes with potential, rather than solely focusing on one or two elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to a TV programme, the senior member of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China said the SAR has huge potential for sports development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the system must be very sound, and this sound method starts from popularising and definitely not focusing on just one or two athletes - but rather on the overall system that can bring out potential. We must put in a great effort. Even for those who have not yet fully realised their potential, we must enable them to be inspired," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Paris Olympics nears its end, Yang said Hong Kong athletes are now world class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR athletes have secured two gold medals in fencing and two bronze medals in swimming.

    Australian government urged to ban gambling ads

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs. Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765725_1_20240811154222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of leading Australians has demanded the government impose a total ban on gambling ads in a country that racks up some of the biggest losses per person in the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gambling losses in Australia, with a population of just 27 million, are estimated at A$25 billion a year (US$16 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adverts enticing people to risk their cash are widespread on television, radio and billboards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs, too, drawing more to part with their money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Gambling advertising in Australia is out of control with one million gambling ads being aired on free-to-air television and radio in just one year," said a letter signed by more than 60 prominent Australians to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the letter released at the weekend included former political, union, sports and faith leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Albanese's Labor government and the conservative opposition to agree to outlaw all gambling advertising within three years, in line with the recommendations of a 2023 report into gambling harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many Australians are alarmed about the proliferation of gambling advertising on our screens and the mounting losses through gambling," said former prime minister John Howard, who was among the signatories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe gambling losses are responsible for enormous harm throughout the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Studies cited by the government put Australian gambling losses at A$25 billion a year, representing a global record per capita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even during a period of Covid-19 measures that closed many pubs, clubs and casinos in the 2020-2021 financial year, Australian state government statistics showed gambling losses exceeded A$24 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total ban on all gambling advertising is essential to stop gambling companies targeting our children," said Alliance for Gambling Reform chief executive Martin Thomas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any decision to simply cap advertising, or limit a blanket ban to only social media, would be a win for vested interests and leave Australians exposed to significant harm," Thomas said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the financial losses, the cost of inaction would be "mounting financial ruin, mental health problems, suicide, and the family violence that gambling can exacerbate", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Nine Entertainment newspapers have said the government is expected to announce proposed legislation within weeks, possibly opting for limits instead of a total advertising ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said last week his government had engaged with "stakeholders" and was committed to "minimising gambling harm" but declined to say whether an advertising ban was envisaged. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that Hong Kong should integrate further with China's national development and contribute to modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan said that the Third Plenary Session held in Beijing last month passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform and Promoting Chinese-style Modernization," which outlines Hong Kong's strategic positioning in leveraging the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, enhances the city's status as an international hub, and supports Hong Kong's bid in gathering top international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an international financial centre, Chan said that Hong Kong should fulfil its role as an offshore RMB business hub, focusing on shipping centre development, smart shipping, and green shipping, to make Hong Kong a "cross-border supply chain management centre" that provides one-stop support for mainland enterprises in expanding their production capacity and supply chain layout overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said this will generate new trade service demands and attract greater opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the SAR government is also recruiting talent and has launched a series of initiatives like the Top Talent Pass Scheme that supports talent development, to attract more top international talent to the region.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong on Sunday kicked off her visit to Hangzhou with a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme - a mentorship scheme aimed at helping underprivileged Hong Kong teenagers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During the five-day trip, Kong, along with the delegation, will visit technology companies and athlete training centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of her departure, Kong said she wanted to give something back to Hong Kong, as she started her new job as an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as an athlete, I worked really hard to train and to make Hong Kong people proud, to win results and to unite everyone so that we can all enjoy sports. And now that I'm lucky enough to join the Jockey Club, I wish I could use my platform and use the power of sports to unite everyone and hopefully just make sure that we all love sports and be happier," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said dozens of underprivileged pupils were joining the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eighty-four pupils and five mentors will take part in the five-day tour. The itinerary is diverse, ranging from innovation and technology, history, culture, to sports. We expect that senior officials from the SAR will also join this tour," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong announced her retirement from full-time fencing last week, after she won the women's individual epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There were 39 events up for contention on Day 15 in Paris, the second last day of these Olympics, and China went on a gold rush, completing a clean sweep of all the golds on offer in diving, table tennis and artistic swimming. The national team also celebrated Olympic wins in weightlifting, rhythmic gymnastics and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That single day haul of six gold medals means China leads the table with 39 golds, ahead of the United States which has 38. Australia maintain third place in the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look back at what unfolded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Gold sweep 1: diving dominance
  </b>
  <br/>

   China completed an historic clean sweep of all eight Olympic diving gold medals after Cao Yuan won the men's 10m platform final on Day 15 in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cao became the first to retain his Olympic 10m crown since American Greg Louganis in Seoul 1988.

    <br/>
    Like the divers, the national table tennis squad also made history by completing a clean sweep of all golds on offer at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    China completed the feat after winning the women's team title, the sixth time the Chinese have collected the full set.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Chinese women withstood a brave Japanese challenge but eventually overpowered their opponents 3-0 to snatch gold, the fifth Olympic title out of five events.

     </div>
     <br/>
     Not to be outdone by the divers and table tennis stars, China's artistic swimmers also completed a golden sweep. After winning the team event, the Chinese twin sibling pair of Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi dazzled in the pool to win gold ahead of Britain who took silver and the Netherlands the bronze.

      Liu Huanhua continued China's powerful showing in weightlifting at the Paris Olympics as he won the men's 102-kilogramme class.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Liu totalled 406kg, 7kg short of his own world record, for his two lifts in the recently-created weight class.

       Israel took silver, while Italy bagged bronze at the Port de La Chapelle Arena.

        There was also gold for Chinese Taipei's Lin Yu-ting who won featherweight gold. Lin, along with Algeria's Imane Khelif, who won gold in the welterweight category, were in the spotlight as part of a gender dispute that has dominated headlines.

         <br/>

         There was also redemption for Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the 5,000m, after failing to medal in the 1,500m, while New Zealander Hamish Kerr won a jump-off for high jump gold and Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi won the women's javelin.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China clinched a third boxing gold at the Paris Olympics, as Li Qian was crowned women's middleweight champion after winning the bout against Panama's Atheyna Bylon on a 4-1 split decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, who took silver in Tokyo, was adjudged as the better performer in two of the three rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old top seed has now collected Olympic medals of all colours, having also won bronze in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
