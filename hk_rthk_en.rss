<div class="itemFullText">
 A High Court jury on Thursday convicted one person and cleared six others over a plot to bomb and shoot police officers in 2019, after Hong Kong's first-ever trial involving United Nations anti-terrorism legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Chun-pong, who was 29 when he was arrested, was found guilty of conspiracy to "likely endanger life or to cause serious injury to property.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to appear in court next Monday to offer a mitigation plea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six co-defendants, Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Justin Hui and Lau Pui-ying were cleared of related charges, including conspiring to set off bombs and conspiracy to murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Cheung Chun-fu, had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of possessing explosives and firearms and was given an 18-month prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution had told the court that the bomb plot involved planting explosives in Wan Chai during a rally to mark International Human Rights Day in December 2019.

    Labour rights group says heat protections not enough

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Survey shows workers felt unwell while working under hot weather and 40 percent of employers provided insufficient heat relief measures. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768168_1_20240829165538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour rights group, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, on Thursday said around 40 percent of employers had insufficient measures to prevent heat stroke among workers during hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association surveyed around 400 workers, mainly construction workers and cleaners, between June and August 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that nearly 50 percent of respondents had felt unwell while working under hot weather, with symptoms including dizziness and headaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also found that workers lacked sufficient rest time during hot conditions, with 40 percent of respondents saying they did not have the basic 10 to 15 minutes of rest every two hours, while nearly half did not receive extra rest during a Heat Stress at Work Warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, head of the association, said employers misunderstood the guidelines from the Labour Department, leading to workers' rest times being reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we only focus on when the heat warning is in effect, the employer needs to provide equipment or measures for cooling. But if they do that, they can reduce the rest time. This is the misleading information for us, because our calculation is we must have a basic rest time, 10 to 15 minutes, plus the extra resting time when the heat warning is in effect. I think most employers or employees do not know this information."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested the government emphasise workers' basic rest time and eliminate the "rest time reducing" approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu believed that due to a lack of legal weight behind the current guidelines, employers may not be willing to cooperate proactively with the recommendations. She hopes legislation could be enacted in future to hold employers accountable.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday met with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Beijing on the third and final day of his visit to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's commitment to the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-US relations remains unchanged," Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said bilateral ties should be developed based on mutual respect, peace co-existence and win-win cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi called on Washington to work with Beijing in the same direction, and view China and its development in a positive and rational manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As two major countries, China and the United States should be responsible for history, for the people and for the world, and should be a source of stability for world peace and a propeller for common development," Xinhua News Agency quoted him as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of his visit on Tuesday, Sullivan has met with high-ranking officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan's visit could pave the way for talks between President Xi and his US counterpart Joe Biden before his term ends in January. (Xinhua and agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resource body on Thursday said its research indicated the development and real estate sectors would need more workers in the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management based the finding on a study of 300 companies in 20 sectors between April and June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the overall workforce in Hong Kong would grow by two percent by 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute said demand for manpower in fields such as architecture, engineering, and construction was expected to grow by up to nine percent, due to major development projects such as the Northern Metropolis and Kau Yi Chau Artificial Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, technological advances would lead to fewer jobs in the retail, transportation and media sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute's president Lawrence Hung, called on the government to adjust its talent recruitment efforts accordingly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should actively listen to industry feedback, provide more proactive measures for businesses to fill vacancies, and adjust talent admission schemes based on actual circumstances to effectively attract overseas talent to supplement the local talent pool," he said in a statement.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spanish actor Rodolfo Sancho leaves court after his son Daniel Sancho Bronchalo was handed a life sentence for the murder of Colombian plastic surgeon Edwin Arrieta Arteaga. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768150_1_20240829152844.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A court in Thailand on Thursday found Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, a member of a famous Spanish acting family, guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced him to life in prison, in a lurid case that involved the victim being dismembered.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Koh Samui Provincial Court issued an initial sentence of death for Sancho, but commuted it to life imprisonment due to his cooperation during the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, a 30-year-old chef with a YouTube channel, had been charged with the murder of Edwin Arrieta Arteaga, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon from Colombia, while the two were on the Thai holiday island of Koh Pha-ngan in August last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The island is famous for its monthly “Full Moon” beach parties, attracting travellers from around the world for all-night raves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convicted man is the son of Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre, a prominent Spanish actor, and Silvia Bronchalo, who has also been in acting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both parents are 49 years old and attended Thursday's court session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At his trial on the island of Samui, Sancho claimed he got into a fight with Arrieta for allegedly trying to sexually assault him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that Arrieta fell as they scuffled and hit his head on a bathtub, losing consciousness and then dying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had pleaded not guilty to charges of premeditated murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho acknowledged dismembering the victim’s body and disposing of the parts on land and at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the charge of concealing or damaging a body, he received a four-month prison sentence, reduced to two months for acknowledging the act, said Paisan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had also pleaded not guilty to the charge of destroying another person's documents — the victim’s passport — for which he received a two-year prison term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The elements of the case — violent death on a holiday island, the celebrity connections and the lurid details — attracted huge coverage in Spanish media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HBO produced a Spanish-language documentary on the events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case came to light when trash collectors found what the Bangkok Post newspaper described as a sawed-off pelvis and intestines weighing about 5 kilos in a sack at a rubbish dump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after that, Sancho reported to police that Arrieta was missing, and officers then gathered evidence linking the two men that led them to detain and interrogate him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police established a narrative, claiming to the press that Sancho had confessed to the murder and saying he had planned it because Arrieta threatened to disgrace him and his family by revealing their alleged sexual relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, through his father and his lawyers, said that was a distorted version of what he told police, and denied having a sexual relationship with Arrieta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police obtained surveillance video showing Sancho allegedly purchasing a knife, rubber gloves, garbage bags and cleaning solutions at a convenience store before Arrieta's death, which prosecutors claimed bolstered the charge of premeditated murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his closing statement earlier in his trial, Sancho told the court he regretted his actions, the Spanish newspaper El País reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am sorry that a life has been lost and that parents have lost a son,” Sancho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am sorry that his family was not able to bury him properly. I’m sorry for what I did after the death.” (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday rolled out the red carpet for a delegation of athletes who competed for the national team at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  SAR officials and primary school students welcomed the 90-member delegation at the airport, which included 65 elite athletes, eight coaches and some administrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan thanked the Olympians for making a three-day visit to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe many Hong Kong residents are as happy as I am. I thank the coaches and athletes for coming to Hong Kong just shortly after the closing of the Olympic Games, allowing us to get a close-up glimpse of the national team athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan, who led the delegation said he felt welcome as soon as he arrived, adding the mainland and Hong Kong should work together to carry forward the spirit of sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have exchanges with the SAR government, departments and residents, especially young people. We will learn from each other, build friendships and contribute to the development of the motherland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One eight-year-old fan was at the airport to greet the athletes and he said he couldn't sleep the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I was too excited! I'd been waiting for this day to come and I couldn't sleep at night! I want to meet Quan Hongchan the most because I like diving. But I'm too short so I couldn't see her," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan said she wanted to meet the table tennis players the most, but she failed to grab a ticket for the gala show and demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to buy a ticket, but I failed. Everyone loves them...I was so excited when I saw Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha because I supported them throughout the whole Paris Olympics," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will meet the press on Thursday afternoon and attend a reception and banquet hosted by the SAR government in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also meet fans at a gala show on Friday and showcase their skills in a series of demonstrations on Saturday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Novak Djokovic racked up his 90th win at the US Open on Wednesday by defeating Serb compatriot Laslo Djere who retired in the third set of their second round clash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a four-time champion at the tournament and seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title, was leading 6-4, 6-4, 2-0 when Djere called it quits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world 109, who pushed his countryman to five sets in New York last year, needed a medical time-out to treat an injury just before dropping the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic had himself required a visit from the trainer for what appeared to be a side strain after sealing the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number two Djokovic is now the only man to have won 90 matches at all four Grand Slams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not what we want to see when there's a retirement. Laslo had an injury which took him off the tour for some time and he's been struggling to come back," said Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's such a good player in these conditions and the second set should have been his, he was 4-2 up. I don't know if my winning the second set probably put more burden on him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic will next meet Australia's Alexei Popyrin who he defeated at the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year with both matches going to four sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Popyrin is on a rich vein of form having won the Montreal Masters on the eve of the US Open. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Thursday met with a top Chinese military official on the third and final day of his visit to China, as the two countries strengthened communication in an effort to prevent differences over the South China Sea and Taiwan from spiralling into conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, warned the US to stop "collusion" with Taiwan, saying the island is "the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said, according to a readout by Defence Ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But 'Taiwan independence' and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are incompatible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan, for his part, stressed the importance of stability in the strait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first meeting between a vice chair of the Central Military Commission and a senior American official since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Your request to meet with me shows the value you attach to military security and the relationship between our militaries,” Zhang told Sullivan in opening remarks earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know it is rare that we have the opportunity to have this kind of exchange and given the state of the world and the need for us to responsibly manage US-China relations, I think it's a very important meeting," Sullivan replied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's meeting followed the latest round of China-US strategic communication held by Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Sullivan on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency described the discussions as "candid, substantive and constructive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said "China-US relations have experienced ups and downs, and that reviewing this experience and its lessons will help forge a better future and find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other," Xinhua reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Taiwan, the foreign minister said "Taiwan independence" poses the biggest risk to cross-strait peace and stability, and that Washington should adhere to the one-China principle and should not support "Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan said China and the US should treat each other as equals, and that Washington has no intention of decoupling from Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Sullivan also agreed on arrangements for a video call between theatre leaders of the two militaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the White House said both countries would plan for a phone call between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in the coming weeks. (Agencies)

    Court threatens to shut down X in Brazil

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Wednesday threatened to shut down the local operations of X, formerly Twitter, unless its billionaire owner Elon Musk named a legal representative in Brazil within 24 hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The order from Justice Alexandre de Moraes was the latest development in an ongoing feud with Musk’s platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company clashed with de Moraes earlier this year over free speech, accounts associated with the far-right and misinformation on the platform, with the social media platform claiming to be a victim of censorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, X said it was removing all remaining Brazil staff in the country “effective immediately,” saying de Moraes had threatened its legal representative in the country with arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday notified X of de Moraes’ order in a reply to a post from the company’s global government affairs account on the social platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case of non-compliance with the determination, the decision could bring about suspension of the social media network’s activities in Brazil,” the court said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, free speech is a constitutional right that’s more permissive than in many countries, including Brazil, where de Moraes in April ordered an investigation into Musk over the dissemination of defamatory fake news and another probe over possible obstruction, incitement and criminal organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil’s political right has long characterised de Moraes as overstepping his bounds to clamp down on free speech and engage in political persecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His defenders have said his actions are lawful, supported by at least the majority of the court’s bench, and have served to protect democracy at a time when it is threatened. (AP)

    Dozens hurt as typhoon hits southern Japan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Typhoon Shanshan slammed into Japan on Thursday, injuring dozens as howling winds smashed windows and blew tiles off houses while torrential rains sparked floods and landslide warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan's most powerful typhoon this year, packing gusts up to 252 kilometres per hour, made landfall on the main southern island of Kyushu, home to 12.5 million people, around 8am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the arrival, authorities issued their highest alert level in places, advising hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate and warning of "life-threatening" flooding, landslides and storm surges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coastal city of Miyazaki has so far recorded 26 injuries – including some from a tornado – with 124 incidents of damage to buildings, a disaster official told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the injuries were caused by strong winds smashing windows, with none life-threatening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Broadcaster NHK reported that nine people were hurt in nearby Kagoshima.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unverified social media footage showed a small river in the city of Beppu turned into a raging torrent of dark water and a fallen tree hanging precipitously above a rainswept road near Oita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student Aoi Nishimoto, 18, said he had called his family in Miyazaki.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our home is fine, but there was a tornado in Miyazaki and power went out in some places. It's worrying," he told AFP in Kyushu's main city Fukuoka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, I am away from my parents' home for the first time. So it's a bit scary being all alone," student Rio Ohtsuru, 19, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe I will look for a flashlight in case of a power outage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyushu's utility operator said that 254,610 houses were already without power elsewhere on the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The system was moving slowly, which often means more rain, with the weather office forecasting it to gradually rumble towards Japan's main island Honshu and the cities of Osaka and Nagoya, although this could change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned that "the risk of a disaster due to heavy rain can rapidly escalate in western Japan as Friday approaches."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Kagoshima, the JMA issued "special warnings of violent storms, high waves and high tides".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please exercise maximum vigilance against violent storms, high waves and high tides in Kagoshima, as well as landslides, flooding in low-lying areas and overflowing rivers in southern Kyushu," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For southern Kyushu, the JMA predicted an enormous 1,100 millimetres of precipitation in the 48 hours to Friday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain brought by Shanshan has been lashing large parts of Japan since Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three members of a family died after a landslide buried a house in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture, late Tuesday, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deceased included a couple in their 70s as well as a son in his 30s, while two adult daughters in their 40s survived with injuries, Kyodo News reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Auto giant Toyota has suspended production at all 14 of its factories in Japan. Nissan and Honda also decided to halt operations at their Kyushu plants, reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan Airlines has cancelled 275 domestic flights for Thursday, affecting 14,893 passengers, and an additional 13 for Friday that would have carried 1,307 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ANA scrapped 212 domestic flights slated for Thursday, affecting 18,700 passengers, and 42 Friday flights, affecting 4,200 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanshan comes in the wake of Typhoon Ampil, which disrupted hundreds of flights and trains this month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish rider Eddie Dunbar produced a sparkling finish to claim the 11th stage of the Vuelta a España on Wednesday while three-time winner Primoz Roglic produced a late surge to chip away at Ben O'Connor's overall lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Team Jayco-AlUla's Dunbar spent much of the 166.5 kilometre route in a breakaway pack, suffering on the sharp hills with everyone else, only bursting clear 600 metres from the line in Padron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known as a climber, it was a surprise move from the 27-year-old Corkman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His rivals failed to pick him up until it was too late, allowing him to take his first ever stage victory in a grand tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a while since I've been in a scenario like this, if I'm honest," Dunbar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just kind of used my experience," he added. "I was suffering a bit on that steep climb, then I realised everyone else was."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Max Poole (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL) followed him across the line two seconds behind to complete the stage podium. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse bounced Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova from the second round of the US Open on Wednesday, beating the Czech 6-4, 7-5 to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have no words at this moment," said a beaming Ruse. "It's just a dream for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruse, ranked 122nd in the world, pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament so far with her win over the eighth-ranked Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech, eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Paris Olympics, opted not to play any hard-court tune-ups heading into the US Open, withdrawing from Toronto with a thigh injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She acknowledged before the tournament that obligations in the wake of her Wimbledon victory "took a lot of energy," although adding a second major after her 2021 French Open victory had boosted her confidence and sense of calm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the 26-year-old Ruse – who thanked her team for seeing her through a series of injuries – next faces 26th-seeded Paula Badosa of Spain, a 6-3, 7-5 winner over American Taylor Townsend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be honest right now, I just want to enjoy," said Ruse, who was especially pleased that her father, Adrian, was on hand to watch her play in the United States for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think my father is the lucky charm, for sure," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Paralympics opened in Paris on Wednesday in a colourful ceremony, kicking off 11 days of competition in a city still riding the wave of the successful Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Games open during a ceremony in a balmy Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,400 competitors from 168 delegations paraded into the venue as the sun set, greeting 30,000 spectators across the historic square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fine weather was in sharp contrast to the heavy rain which fell throughout the Olympics opening ceremony in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a symbol of inclusion, a mix of able-bodied and disabled dancers performed on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons then expressed his hope for an "inclusion revolution", before Macron officially declared the Games open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eighteen of the 35 Olympic venues - including the Grand Palais and the Stade de France - will be utilised again for the Paralympics, which run until September 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than two million of the 2.5 million tickets on sale have been snapped up, with several events sold out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, which won 96 golds at the last Paralympics in Tokyo, returns with 284 athletes, the most for any delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 126 males and 158 females will compete in 302 events over 19 sports, with 95 being first-time Paralympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China hopes to match their five-medal haul in Tokyo with a 23-strong delegation. Badminton star Daniel Chan and table tennis player Wong Ting-ting were the SAR's flag bearers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has sent a team of 140 athletes to compete in 17 sports, even as the war against Russian forces rages at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 100 athletes from Russia and Belarus will compete under a neutral banner, but they were barred from the ceremonies. (AP, Reuters, Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief of Telegram Pavel Durov on Wednesday was charged by the French judiciary with a litany of violations related to the messaging app but allowed to go free while being banned from leaving the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Durov was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros and on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remaining in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement following an hours-long hearing with two investigating magistrates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges concern alleged crimes involving an organised group including "complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable an illicit transaction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov has also been charged with refusing to share documents demanded by authorities as well as "dissemination in an organised group of images of minors in child pornography" as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said that the French judicial authorities had been made aware of the "near total absence of a response" from Telegram to requests from the authorities and had first opened an investigation in February 2024. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, as traders looked ahead to earnings results from US chipmaking giant Nvidia after the closing bell.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished the day down 0.4 percent at 41,091, and the S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent to 5,592.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq closed down more than 1.1 percent at 17,556.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past couple of weeks, Nvidia has been rising, with the anticipation being that the company is going to do better than expectations," said Ventura Wealth Management's Tom Cahill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the bar is so high that it's not hard to imagine them saying growth is going to slow even just a little bit," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That would be very negative for the stock and therefore technology stocks in the market. There's a little apprehension."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia's share price closed down 2.1 percent ahead of its earnings results.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="UK PM Keir Starmer's Labour Party has said it would seek a security and defence treaty with Olaf Scholz's Germany as part of a wider push to mend ties with the EU. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768063_1_20240829014505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on a visit to Berlin on Wednesday that a planned new treaty with Germany was part of his nation's push to mend EU ties damaged by Brexit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move toward a reset, welcomed by German leader Olaf Scholz, will also include the British premier travelling to Paris for talks with President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said the proposed accord, set to include a defence agreement and deeper links on science, technology as well as trade, was hoped to be agreed by year's end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British premier called the planned treaty a "once in a generation chance" to aid a "wider reset" in UK-EU ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz welcomed his UK counterpart's desire for a "reset," adding: "We want to accept this outstretched hand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour had said it would seek a security and defence treaty with Germany if it won the July 4 general election, which it did by a landslide – propelling Starmer to the premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's host Scholz has been under pressure to crack down on illegal migration after a suspected Islamist knife attack in the western city of Solingen on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stabbing, which left three people dead and eight injured, was allegedly carried out by a 26-year-old Syrian man who evaded attempts by German authorities to deport him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's premiership has faced an early challenge after a deadly knife attack in Southport last month sparked anti-immigration riots, which officials say were stoked by far-right elements and false information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said that he and Scholz had "agreed to develop a joint action plan to tackle illegal migration" and "smash the smuggler gangs who perpetrate this vile trade."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair also discussed the war in Ukraine, with both countries under pressure over their aid for Kyiv to help it fight off Russia's assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz insisted that both countries "stand firm at Ukraine's side," despite "recent attempts to sow doubt about this commitment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our resolve is as ever to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine to provide the support that it needs for as long as it needs," Starmer added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv's Western allies have reacted cautiously to Ukraine's recent incursion into Kursk, worried that their weapons could be used on Russian soil, possibly sparking a strong reaction from Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain allows Kyiv to deploy a squadron of 14 British-made Challenger 2 tanks as it sees fit, but has put limits on the use of its long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said on Wednesday that "no new decisions have been taken" in terms relating to tactical questions on the use of weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has repeatedly refused to send Kyiv its long-range Taurus missiles, over fears of escalating the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has been the second-largest contributor of aid to Ukraine after the United States, but plans to halve the budget for that aid next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Where Germany spent around eight billion euros (US$9 billion) on aid for Ukraine in 2024, the latest draft earmarks around four billion euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a European Political Community (EPC) summit in England two weeks after his election win, Starmer told European leaders the UK would be a "friend and partner" to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has ruled out rejoining the European single market, customs union or freedom of movement – to avoid reopening what remains a thorny issue among British politicians and the public alike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he does want to negotiate a new security pact with the bloc and a veterinary agreement to ease border checks on agricultural foods, as well as an improved trading deal. (AFP)

    Tens of millions bake under extreme heat in eastern US

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768062_1_20240829012725.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 million people were sweltering under heat alerts on Wednesday as a late-summer surge of extreme temperatures blanketed much of the eastern half of the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Record heat was expected to impact the mid-Atlantic states with temperature highs of around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) in and around the capital Washington, the National Weather Service said, though the heat wave was expected to be short-lived as a cooler and damper front moves in from Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys will feel a couple more days of high temperatures topping into the upper 90s at the hottest locations," added NWS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Baltimore, the mayor's office issued a "code red extreme heat alert" and posted on X the locations of five cooling centres opened to support the city's homeless population. Authorities were also distributing cold water to those without shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advised people who are outdoors in regions where the heat threat is considered "major" to stay in the shade, take breaks, and confine their activities to the coolest parts of the day or evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also important to carry a bottle of water, limit intake of caffeine, and monitor urine colour for signs of dehydration, the agency advised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate change has been extending the heat season across much of the United States, increasing both the frequency and intensity of heat waves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the US, even though heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable through outreach and intervention, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association found heat-related mortality rates in the United States increased between 1999 and 2023, especially during the last seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the true number of heat-related deaths is probably still being underestimated, the authors wrote, due to potential misclassification of causes of death and a lack of data on vulnerable populations. (AFP)

    Pope says repelling, abandoning migrants a 'grave sin'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis condemned on Wednesday efforts to repel migrants and block their routes as a "grave sin," as he recalled those who lost their lives, including those "abandoned" in the desert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 87-year-old regularly calls for more empathy for people fleeing conflict, poverty, disasters or persecution, particularly those seeking to reach Europe from Africa across the Mediterranean Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dedicated his address at his weekly audience on Wednesday to the subject, warning against "restrictive laws" and the "militarisation of borders" and calling for safe migration routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It must be said clearly: there are those who work systematically and with every means possible to repel migrants. And this, when done with awareness and responsibility, is a grave sin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He repeated that the Mediterranean – where more than 3,000 migrants went missing last year, according to UN figures – has become a "cemetery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some deserts too, unfortunately, are becoming cemeteries of migrants. And even here it is not always a question of 'natural' deaths. No," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At times, they have been taken to the desert and abandoned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the time of satellites and drones, there are migrant men, women and children that no-one must see. Only God sees them and hears their cry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not specify any particular country but said that his description of seas and deserts also includes oceans, lakes and rivers, as well as forests, jungles and steppes "where migrants walk alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Brothers and sisters, we can all agree on one thing: migrants should not be in those seas and in those lethal deserts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it is not through more restrictive laws, it is not with the militarisation of borders, it is not with rejection that we will obtain this result," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called for "safe and legal" routes for migrants and asylum seekers, and greater international efforts to combat human trafficking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union admitted in May to a "difficult situation" after a journalism consortium said Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania were dumping migrants in the desert, using the bloc's funds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-nation EU has struck deals with the three countries with explicit financing to boost stopping irregular migration to Europe. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly ticked lower on Wednesday, as investors await chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report after the closing bell.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 15 minutes into trading, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,616, while the tech-rich Nasdaq slumped 0.5 percent to 17,674.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones was flat at 41,232.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The focus on chip titan Nvidia comes as markets try to gauge the health of the tech and AI sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has seen profits surge thanks to demand for its GPU chips, which have set the industry's pace in pushing new AI advances – making it an indicator for the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia shares slid 1.4 percent in early trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Nvidia, traders will also be monitoring an update to US second quarter GDP growth on Thursday and data on the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation gauge on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a US central bank rate cut is widely expected in September, upcoming economic indicators are watched for their potential bearing on how big the reductions could go.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's leading automaker BYD reported a 24.4 percent rise in net profit for the first half of 2024.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD reported a 32.8 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, its fastest growth since the end of 2023, despite faltering spending on big-ticket items in the world's largest car market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Net profit hit 9.1 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion) in the April-June quarter, while revenue was up 25.9 percent from a year earlier at 176.2 billion yuan, it said in a stock exchange filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first half of 2024, net profit jumped 24.4 percent to 13.6 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has taken a significant lead in the electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sector, leveraging its vertical integration strategy by using key components such as batteries made by the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has outsold the combined sales of Volkswagen's two joint ventures in China by 14.5 percent in the first seven months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to unseat Tesla as the largest EV vendor this year with a 17.7 percent share of the global market, versus Tesla's 17.2 percent, according to analysts' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been offering aggressive discounts for its best-selling Dynasty and Ocean series of EVs to secure its leadership position with a more than one-third share in China's new energy vehicle market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has also expanded its international presence, such as in Europe and Mexico, where it has plans to set up manufacturing facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company is facing a 17 percent additional tariff for exporting EVs from China to countries in the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overseas shipments accounted for 11.9 percent of BYD's total car sales in the first seven months of the year, nearly double the number for the same period last year, according to calculations based on BYD's monthly data. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched an initiative that allows financial institutions to experiment with the use of its wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) in a controlled space.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The digital currency was introduced in March with the purpose of letting financial institutions settle interbank payments and trades faster and easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Project Ensemble Sandbox provides a virtual environment in which financial institutions can look at how to use digital currencies in various scenarios, with no risk of affecting the real-world market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said he is pleased to see financial institutions expressing great interest in experimenting with wCBDC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the launch of the sandbox is the city’s first step towards harnessing blockchain technology and smart contracts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see the sandbox as a pioneering financial infrastructure and also a collaborative platform to test and refine different use cases, covering areas ranging from fixed income and investment funds, liquidity management, green and sustainable finance to trade and supply chain financing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But the potential of the sandbox extends far beyond these initial applications. It is designed in a way that will enable it to support various forms of digital money and digital assets and ensure seamless integration with other infrastructure in the future.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said he hopes the pilot use cases would help set industry benchmarks for tokenisation in Hong Kong, as well as offer solutions to pain points in the real economy, including supply chain finance and cross-border payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Julia Leung, said the financial regulator fully supports HKMA's project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the SFC has been ahead of the game in providing guidance to the industry on the use of tokenised securities, as well as allowing the launch of investment funds in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are among the first to set clear regulatory expectations in these areas… These pilots have demonstrated cost savings and efficiency gains in the different phases of the product lifecycle, but they also point to the hurdles in reaping the full benefits of on-chain primary issuance, secondary market trading, custody, and hypothecation during the full product lifecycle. This is where today's sandbox comes in,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung added that the SFC is aware of hurdles the industry participants may face as they pilot test different use scenarios in the sandbox and assured them that the SFC will work closely with the HKMA to provide guidance and address concerns that arise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representatives from six sandbox participants – Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Hong Kong, HashKey Group and Ant Digital Technologies – also attended the ceremony and spoke about their individual plans for the sandbox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA said it will hold regular meetings with the financial institutions and the SFC to review the sandbox candidates' readiness to operate in the live market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA deputy chief executive Howard Lee said there is no specific timetable or expected duration for the sandbox programme, saying some cases may reach maturity in two to three months, while others may take longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say it would depend on individual cases and what kind of activities they are going to touch upon. If they are talking about tokenised bond this is a pretty mature financial product … that would be more ready to be transferred to the real life environment using different settlement methods or even tokenised deposit to do it… But for those who are a little bit less familiar and they might require more discussion with HKMA, with SFC, then these projects might need a little bit more time,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched raids on Wednesday across the occupied West Bank, where its forces killed at least nine Palestinians and sealed off the volatile city of Jenin, according to Palestinian officials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jewish state has carried out near-daily raids across the West Bank since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the ongoing war there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militant groups said they were exchanging fire with the Israeli military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governor of Jenin, Kamal Abu al-Rub, said on Palestinian radio that Israeli forces had surrounded the city, blocking exit and entry points and access to hospitals, and ripping up infrastructure in the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said Israeli forces had blocked the roads leading to a hospital with dirt barriers and surrounded other medical facilities in Jenin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military confirmed it was operating in the cities of Jenin and Tulkarem but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz drew comparisons with Gaza and called for similar measures in the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must deal with the threat just as we deal with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and whatever steps might be required. This is a war in every respect, and we must win it," he wrote on the platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank to rise up, saying the raids are part of a larger plan to expand the war in Gaza and blaming the escalation on US support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 652 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli fire since the war in Gaza began over 10 months ago, according to the Palestinian ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most have died during such raids, which often trigger gun battles with militants. (AP)

    English coach Ashley Westwood named HK boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="English coach Ashley Westwood named HK boss" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768006_1_20240828164544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former English Premier League ace Ashley Westwood was on Wednesday named as the new head coach of the Hong Kong, China men's football team.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Westwood has signed a two-year contract and will get to know his squad at a tri-nations tournament in Fiji next month, though interim coach Wolfgang Luisser will take charge of the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood most recently led Afghanistan's national team, and he's also coached in England and managed in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says his goal is to take Hong Kong to the Asian Cup finals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think first and foremost we'll set a good culture and we will make sure the environment that we bring them into is one that they'll want to play, they'll want to come and learn, they'll want to come and improve. I don't have any reservations about the quality in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I've played here before with my Indian sides, I've seen their standard. I think there's good players here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood started his career in the Manchester United academy and played more than 400 senior games in English football for the likes of Crewe, Sheffield Wednesday and Wrexham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most notably, he was part of the Bradford City team that made it to the English Premier League for the first time in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood turned to coaching after his retirement, working for English clubs before switching to Asia, claiming a league title with Bengalaru in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll take charge of the Hong Kong, China team for the first time in a friendly match against Liechtenstein on October 10 in Vaduz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former coach Jørn Andersen left the SAR in May, later taking up an appointment with a team on the mainland. In January, he led the team to the Asian Cup finals for the first time since 1968.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Football Association of Hong Kong, China also announced a HK$500,000 initiative to promote football refereeing, in the hope SAR referees will officiate in international competitions in the future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan issued an emergency warning on Wednesday as powerful Typhoon Shanshan approached the southwestern region with heavy rain and strong winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines and rail operators cancelled some services over the coming days as the typhoon, categorised as "very strong", packed strong winds and gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maximum caution is required given that forecasts are for strong winds, high waves and high tides that have not been seen thus far," the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanshan is expected to strike the southwestern Kyushu island over the next few days and approach the central and eastern regions, which includes the capital Tokyo, around the weekend, JMA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities issued evacuation orders for more than 800,000 residents in Kagoshima prefecture in Kyushu and the central Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two people were missing after a landslide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A wall of mud, rocks and other debris on Tuesday swept away a house in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture. Three others had been pulled out, according to public broadcaster NHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The typhoon also prompted Toyota Motor to suspend operations at all of its domestic factories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 28 production lines at 14 group companies will suspend operations from Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoon Shanshan is the latest storm to hit Japan following last week's Typhoon Ampil, which also led to blackouts and evacuations. (Reuters/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of protesters clashed in India's eastern city of Kolkata on Wednesday as demonstrations seeking justice for a murdered doctor spiralled into violent street skirmishes between political rivals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's body at a state-run hospital in Kolkata on August 9 stoked nationwide anger over the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sparked strikes by medics and rallies backed by thousands of ordinary citizens across India, although many doctors have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But repeated protests in West Bengal state capital Kolkata have transformed into clashes between the state's ruling All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and holds power nationally, but sits in opposition in West Bengal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want justice", BJP supporters chanted, referring to the murdered doctor, then demanding the resignation of AITMC leader Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Go back! Go back!" AITMC supporters shouted in return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, police clashed with protesters, firing tear gas canisters and water cannons, and arresting at least 245 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That prompted BJP supporters on Wednesday to launch a day-long shutdown of Kolkata, with skirmishes against AITMC supporters in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters erected barricades to close roads and railway lines, with police reporting clashes between rival workers across the city and in adjoining districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained for the murder, but Banerjee's government has faced public criticism for the handling of the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Supreme Court has ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the "horrific" killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation". (AFP)

    Trump faces revised indictment in 2020 election case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Special counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment against Donald Trump over his alleged efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767987_1_20240828152343.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump faced a revised federal indictment on Tuesday accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, with prosecutors narrowing their approach after a US Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith's team obtained the superseding indictment in the Washington case, though it was highly unlikely to proceed to trial ahead of the November 5 election when Trump faces his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised indictment lays out the same four charges prosecutors brought against the former president last year, but this one focuses on Trump's role as a political candidate seeking re-election, rather than as the president at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that Trump is at least presumptively immune from criminal prosecution for actions that were within his constitutional powers as president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington was expected to decide in coming weeks which aspects of the case must be tossed out based on the Supreme Court's immunity decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump in a statement on his Truth Social media platform said the Supreme Court's immunity ruling should lead to the entire case being thrown out, saying, "Smith rewrote the exact same case in an effort to circumvent the Supreme Court Decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, denouncing this case and the others he faces as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls have shown Harris opening up a narrow national lead over Trump since President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This indictment, like the initial one, accuses Trump of a multi-part conspiracy to block the certification of his election defeat to Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It retains allegations Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to use his role presiding over the congressional certification of the election on January 6, 2021, to reject electoral votes from battleground states Trump lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on that January 6 in an attempt to halt the congressional certification, which remains part of the case against Trump. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation experts are urging people to keep an eye out next time they're walking by a river, as they may catch a rare glimpse of an endangered Eurasian otter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Researchers from the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden on Wednesday said they have found traces of the mammals' faeces by the Ng Tung River near Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said that previously, signs of the creature had only been found in remote areas, and this discovery proves that they can live close to urban districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Jianhuan, Conservation Manager of Kadoorie Conservation China, said this is the first time the farm has found signs of the animals in rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new finding in the Ng Tung River is also very important because previously the otters recorded in Hong Kong were mainly in mangrove forests and the fish pond areas, and this is the record that proves the otter can inhabit the water channels close to urban areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the expert warned that planned developments for the Northern Metropolis could threaten the otters' habitats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are not mountain species, they don't live in the country parks. They live in low land and much of their habitats are unprotected and under severe human disturbance... and all these lowland wetlands are right within the Northern Metropolis area," Yang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that if people do manage to spot one of the otters, they should leave it alone and contact the organisation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's former top court judge, Sam Hou-fai, on Wednesday formally declared his intention to run for the post of chief executive in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Sam resigned as president of the Court of Final Appeal to pave the way for his leadership bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Macau Science Centre, Sam said if elected, he would firmly implement the principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and make government more efficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also vowed to safeguard Macau's long-term stability and prosperity, and create a better future for the gambling hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The international environment has been changing and developing rapidly. In the past few years, it has brought challenges to the development of our country, and to our small special administrative region, the Macau SAR," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must reform and innovate to solve the difficulties in the development process, and mitigate the negative effects of some development bottlenecks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam said he will start getting in touch with the 400 election committee members on Thursday, when nominations open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefuls need to secure at least 66 nominations in order to run in the poll slated for October 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to reporters' questions in Portuguese, Sam also pledged to preserve the Macanese culture and the Portuguese language.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 25 years since the handover, the Macanese community has actively participated in various fields such as politics, economy, culture, professional sectors, and education in Macau. They have made important contributions to the successful implementation and development of 'One Country, Two Systems' with unique characteristics in our SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These contributions are evident for everyone. The Macanese community, including the Macanese people and the Portuguese language as an official language, is a distinctive and important feature of our Macau SAR that's not found elsewhere."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam, 62, became a lawyer on the mainland before moving to Macau in 1986. He went to Portugal to study in 1990 and returned to the casino hub three years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became a judge in 1997 and was appointed president of Macau's Court of Final Appeal in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He tried major cases during his tenure, including the corruption trial of former transport and public works chief Ao Man-long, who was sentenced to 29 years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If elected, Sam would be the first Macau CE without a business background.

    Home prices fall again, rents hit near 5-year highs

<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures showed home prices in Hong Kong continued to fall last month, whereas rents reached their highest in nearly five years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to data from the Rating and Valuation Department, private flats were 1.9 percent cheaper in July than the month before, marking the third consecutive month of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home prices briefly rose after the government scrapped all market-cooling measures in February, before the downward trend resumed in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, prices were down by 4.7 percent year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have said sales may pick up after interest rates start to fall, with the US Federal Reserve indicating that it will begin reducing borrowing costs in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, strong demand pushed rents up by 1.1 percent last month from June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That raised private sector rents to their highest levels since October 2019.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday ordered a retrial in the case of a man cleared of involvement in a mob attack in and around Yuen Long MTR Station in July 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice had earlier appealed against the District Court's decision to acquit Wong Chi-wing on charges of rioting and wounding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher court accepted that appeal and remitted the case to the District Court for retrial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong was released on bail ahead of an expected court appearance on October 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four others – Tang Wai-sum, Ng Wai-nam, Tang Ying-bun and Choi Lap-ki – were earlier jailed for between three and seven years on the same charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi's conviction was later quashed on appeal, while the other three lost challenges against their convictions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park said panda lovers may have to wait until February next year before they catch a glimpse of the new twin babies born earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Times, Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong made reference to the panda twins born in Macau in 2016, noting that cubs would normally be at least six months old before going on display and meeting the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for two adult giant pandas that are set to arrive in the SAR next month as gifts by the mainland authorities, Pong said they are expected to the meet the public in December at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the number of people visiting the giant pandas would be restricted in the initial stage, which would allow them to better adapt to the new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong added that Ocean Park would look for names for the cubs and the new giant pandas in the next few months, and hopes the public can provide suggestions.

    Alcaraz, Sinner power into second round at US Open

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz survived US Open first round wobbles on Tuesday to stay on course for a semi-final showdown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz roared home for a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory over 186th-ranked Australian Li Tu to launch his bid to add the US Open to the Roland Garros and Wimbledon titles he claimed this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Spaniard pushed his Grand Slam winning streak to 15 matches as he tries to join Rod Laver and Rafael Nadal as the only men in the modern era to win the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in the same year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He got off to a hot start, seizing a 4-0 lead on the way to pocketing the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tu, who came through qualifying, got to grips with the imposing Arthur Ashe Stadium and Alcaraz's serve to take the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He tried to keep the pressure on in the third, but Alcaraz's break for a 4-3 lead opened the floodgates, the Spaniard winning the eight straight games to take the third set and build a 5-0 lead in the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it surprised me a little bit. In the first set, it was obvious that he started the match nervous," Alcaraz said of Tu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But after the first he started to enjoy, to play really great tennis. I was playing great – probably a few mistakes," added Alcaraz, who had 50 winners and 30 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Spaniard, who won the first of his four Grand Slam titles in New York in 2022, will face Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round, headed toward a possible semi-final showdown with top-ranked Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Sinner, meanwhile, fought back from a set and break down to defeat Mackenzie McDonald at the US Open on Tuesday in his first match since being embroiled in a doping test controversy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Sinner battled to a 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 win over his 140th-ranked opponent on Arthur Ashe Stadium, racing away with 18 of the last 22 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old Sinner was returning to action just a week after it was revealed he had failed two drug tests in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first match is not easy. McDonald played really well in the beginning so I just tried to stay there mentally and find some rhythm to keep going," Sinner said. "I have room to improve and I'm looking forward to that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory on Tuesday was also a first win for Sinner on the showpiece Arthur Ashe Stadium. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell in early trading on Wednesday, opening down 0.15 percent at 17,848.
 <br>
  <br/>
  E-commerce shares stabilised in Hong Kong after suffering following downbeat remarks from discount online retailer PDD Holdings earlier in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's biggest sportswear maker, Anta, was the top gainer and shares were up 8.5 percent after better-than-expected profits and US$1.3 billion buyback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland markets also dropped, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index down 0.15 percent to open at 2,844. The Shenzhen Component Index on the mainland's second exchange opened 0.39 percent lower at 8,072. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wout van Aert won the 10th stage of the Vuelta a España on Tuesday to seal a hat-trick of victories on his debut in the Spanish Grand Tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Belgian Visma-Lease a Bike rider worked with Quentin Pacher on the way to the finish in Galicia, with the French rider leading out but soon accepting defeat against the sprint king.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor keeps the overall lead from Primoz Roglic on a relaxed afternoon for the red jersey rider, as the peloton rolled in five-and-a-half minutes down on Van Aert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a tricky 160 kilometre ride from Ponteareas to Baiona, with four categorised climbs, as the race moved north after Monday's rest day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not too often that I can win when my family visits me on the race," said Van Aert, 29, who celebrated with his loved ones after his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was my aim to be in the breakaway, I had a hard time to be honest on the first climb, I almost gave up, I had one more try at the top for 50km – we had to fight for a bit of a gap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Van Aert is making his debut on the Vuelta after a disappointing Tour de France, when he was unable to secure any victories. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigeria's men's football team on Tuesday appointed experienced German Bruno Labbadia as the country's new coach.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 58-year-old will lead the team against Benin and Rwanda in 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nigeria welcome Benin to Uyo on September 7, before a trip to Rwanda three days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labbadia has handled several top Bundesliga clubs including VfB Stuttgart, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) general secretary Mohammed Sanusi said: "The NFF Executive Committee has approved the recommendation of its technical and development sub-committee to appoint Mr. Bruno Labbadia as the head coach of the Super Eagles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the sixth German to lead the Super Eagles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a player, Labbadia was a prolific scorer, notching over 200 goals in a career that included a spell with Bayern Munich. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX is poised for another attempt at launching a daring orbital expedition featuring an all-civilian crew that is aiming to carry out the first-ever spacewalk by private citizens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Polaris Dawn mission, organised by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman is now set to lift off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a four-hour window beginning on Wednesday at 3:38 am local time (0738 GMT), with backup opportunities available on Thursday if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather conditions appeared 85 percent favourable, according to a US Space Force forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier launch attempt on Tuesday was scrapped due to a helium leak on a line connecting the tower to the rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX Dragon capsule is set to reach a peak altitude of 1,400 kilometres – higher than any crewed mission in more than half a century, since the Apollo era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mission commander Isaacman will guide his four-member team through the mission's centrepiece: the first-ever spacewalk carried out by non-professional astronauts, equipped with sleek, newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rounding out the team are mission pilot Scott Poteet, a retired US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel; mission specialist Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX; and mission specialist and medical officer Anna Menon, also a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quartet underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving, and summiting an Ecuadorian volcano.

  Polaris Dawn is set to be the first of three missions under the Polaris programme, a collaboration between Isaacman, the founder of tech company Shift4 Payments, and SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isaacman declined to reveal his total investment in the project, though reports suggest he paid around US$200 million for the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, the first all-civilian orbital mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day, venturing briefly into the Van Allen radiation belt, a region teeming with high-energy charged particles that can pose health risks to humans over extended periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On day three, the crew will don their state-of-the-art EVA spacesuits – outfitted with heads-up displays, helmet cameras, and advanced joint mobility systems – and take turns to venture outside their spacecraft in twos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each will spend 15 to 20 minutes in space, 700 kilometres above Earth's surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on their to-do list are testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and Starlink, SpaceX's more than 6,000-strong constellation of internet satellites, in a bid to boost space communication speeds, and conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include tests with contact lenses embedded with microelectronics to continuously monitor changes in eye pressure and shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After six days in space, the mission will conclude with a splashdown off the coast of Florida. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks ended on Tuesday slightly higher as markets look ahead to an earnings report by chipmaker Nvidia this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,625, as did the Nasdaq, which closed at 17,754.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones was flat at 41,250.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks are treading water as investors await AI chipmaker Nvidia's results after markets close on Wednesday – eyeing the company as a gauge of the tech and AI sectors' health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "pent-up demand" to see what Nvidia will do next, said Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the economy is "not doing great," it is good enough for key indices to continue advancing, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, markets have been assuaged by comments of US central bank chief Jerome Powell, who said last week that the time had come for interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders widely anticipate a cut of at least 25 basis points after Federal Reserve policymakers gather for a meeting in September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would mark the Fed's first rate reductions after raising rates during the pandemic.
  <br/>

    Harry Kane receives European Golden Shoe in Munich

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Harry Kane scored more goals last season than any other player in Europe. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767904_1_20240828015826.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane received the Golden Shoe award as the highest goalscorer in a European football league at a ceremony in the Bavarian capital on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kane scored 36 goals during the previous Bundesliga season, more than any other player in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being the top Premier League scorer three times, Kane had never won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a fantastic feeling," Kane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The award is for everyone. Without you, I wouldn't be standing here today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel good and am looking forward to the new season. I feel a new energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud to receive this award."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prize was the latest won by the striker in a long list of personal awards, but Kane is still yet to win a team title in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane went trophy-less in his debut year in Munich, the first time Bayern finished a season without silverware since 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters: "I want to continue on as I started last season, but it is important to win titles. We want to achieve success as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane's tally of 36 goals in 32 Bayern appearances is just five shy of the single-season record held by former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski of 41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England captain was handed the award by Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen, who praised Kane's character since making the move to Munich one season ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Created in the 1967-68 season, the Golden Shoe was formerly awarded to the top scorer in any European league, but in 1997 was changed to use a ranking system which favours players in higher-ranked leagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With six wins, Lionel Messi has received the award more than anyone else. Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland have previously won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is something special that I am now mentioned in the same breath as these names," Kane said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The protests over the gruesome rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata continue. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767902_1_20240828013657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in India fired tear gas and water cannon on Tuesday as they clashed with thousands of protesters seeking justice for a doctor who was raped and murdered in Kolkata this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a state-run hospital in the eastern city stoked nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's demonstration saw thousands march to a government building in Kolkata to demand the resignation of Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They shouted slogans and clashed with police, who charged the crowd with batons in an effort to disperse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namita Ghosh, a college student who attended the protest, said that the crowd had intended to "protest peacefully" before the baton charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 100 protesters "have been arrested on the charge of creating violence," a senior police official said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous protests in Kolkata prompted by the crime have transformed into unruly political rallies, with police scuffling with demonstrators from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) angry at the state government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but it is an opposition party in West Bengal, of which Kolkata is the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have accused Banerjee's government of creating an unsafe environment for women that allowed crimes including the doctor's murder to occur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman's body was found in the teaching hospital's seminar hall, suggesting she had gone there for a break during a 36-hour shift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doctors' associations in many cities launched strikes over the murder that cut off non-essential services, though medical professionals have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained over the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gruesome nature of the attack has invoked comparisons with the horrific 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That incident sparked widespread outrage in a country where sexual violence against women is endemic, with an average of nearly 90 rapes a day were reported in 2022 in the country of 1.4 billion people. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Owners of the US National Football League (NFL) are set to vote on Tuesday on allowing private equity investment, a move that could offer an influx of cash for new stadiums and other projects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the vote, the NFL's 32 owners are likely to allow private equity firms to purchase up to a 10 percent team stake, according to a CNBC report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of companies that have been approved plan to commit US$12 billion in capital over time, CNBC added, citing people familiar with the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each fund or consortium can make deals with up to six teams, and the firms which have been green-lit include Ares Management, Sixth Street Partners and Arctos Partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also a consortium including names like Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other large sports leagues like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association already allow private equity ownership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the NFL – the most popular and prosperous US league – formed a committee to consider allowing private equity funding, and it has recently met with the companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With rising valuations of NFL teams, fewer potential owners can come up with full funding when teams are on the market. (AFP)

    US consumer confidence up slightly in August

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The modest rise in consumer confidence is likely to be well-received by Vice President Kamala Harris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767898_1_20240828001001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer confidence in the United States rose slightly in August, according to survey data published on Tuesday, beating expectations and extending a recent increase in optimism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Conference Board's consumer confidence index inched higher to 103.3 in August, up slightly from a revised figure of 101.9 a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was comfortably above market expectations, according to Briefing.com.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The modest rise is likely to be well-received by US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against former president Donald Trump in November's elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two candidates have looked to talk up their respective economic records, with the cost of living and inflation playing a major role in the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall consumer confidence rose in August but remained within the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years," Conference Board chief economist Dana Peterson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers continued to express mixed feelings in August," she added. "Compared to July, they were more positive about business conditions, both current and future, but also more concerned about the labour market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month's US jobs report came in well below expectations, setting off a brief fall in stock markets and raising fears of recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, markets stabilised almost as rapidly as they had fallen, and monetary policymakers have stressed that the labour market remains relatively strong by historical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers' assessments of the current labour situation, while still positive, continued to weaken, and assessments of the labour market going forward were more pessimistic," Peterson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer confidence declined for people under the age of 35, although young people remained the most optimistic age group, according to Peterson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a disparity based on income, with consumers earning more than US$100,000 a year feeling the most confident, and those on salaries of less than US$25,000 noting a decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The index continues to waffle in a narrow range, much like other measures of consumer spirits," Navy Federal Credit Union corporate economist Robert Frick said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may take a major shift, such as significantly lower interest rates or the expansion getting a second wind, before we see optimism rise to pre-2020 levels," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation expectations dropped to 4.9 percent in August, their lowest level since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Conference Board said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer expectations of higher interest rates in the next 12 months fell for the third consecutive month, hitting the lowest level since February this year. (AFP)

    India's Jay Shah to be cricket world body chairman

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's cricket chief Jay Shah has been elected unopposed as chairman of the sport's world body, the International Cricket Council, it said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shah will take over the role from December, after current Chair Greg Barclay decided not to seek a third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and our member nations to further globalise cricket," Shah said, adding he was "humbled" by the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From being the chief of the world's richest cricket board to leading the ICC, the 35-year-old's meteoric rise illustrates India's domination of the sport's global administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a country where the sport and politics go hand in glove, Shah is best known for being the son of home minister Amit Shah, the right-hand man of Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah, the powerful Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India since 2019, becomes the youngest ICC chairman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top cricketers in India enjoy superstardom with millions of die-hard fans, most lucrative playing contracts, and endorsement deals not seen anywhere else in global cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By some counts, Indian cricket on average generates more revenue than Bollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 percent of the sport's billion-plus worldwide fans are in the Indian subcontinent, according to a 2018 ICC study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICC is the global governing body for cricket, with more than 100 members, and is responsible for staging global events such as the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah said he wanted to "embrace fresh thinking and innovation to elevate the love for cricket worldwide." (AFP)

    UN nuclear head at Russian plant warns over fighting

    <![CDATA[<img alt='General Director of the IAEA Rafael Grossi says he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767893_1_20240827225153.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN nuclear watchdog head Rafael Grossi on Tuesday warned during a visit to Russia's Kursk nuclear plant that its proximity to ongoing fighting was "extremely serious" following Ukraine's unprecedented cross-border offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi said his tour enabled him to "look at the most important parts" of the plant, which is less than 50 kilometres from fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A nuclear power plant of this type so close to a point of contact or military front is an extremely serious fact," Grossi said after visiting the plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact we have military activity a few kilometres, a few miles away from here, make it an immediate point of attention," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the end of the day, again, this may sound common sense and simple: Don't attack a nuclear power plant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, adding it was "important to talk" and "keep dialogue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Kursk power plant currently was "operating in a very close to normal conditions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned of the dangers of fighting around nuclear plants following Russia's full-scale military offensive into Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first days of the conflict, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, and also briefly held the decommissioned Chernobyl plant in the north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine launched its surprise incursion into Kursk on August 6 and has said it is making advances, even as Russian forces move deeper into eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Ukraine of trying to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant, with drone fragments found near its spent nuclear fuel storage facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was informed about the impact of drones, I was shown some of the remnants of those, signs of impact they had," Grossi said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant lies some 60 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border, next to the Seym river, and less than 50 kilometres away from Kursk city, the region's capital with a population of around 440,000. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said it rescued an Israeli hostage in Gaza on Tuesday after a "complex operation", as the Israel-Hamas war, now in its 11th month, showed no signs of abating.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kaid Alkadi, a 52-year-old Israeli Bedouin, was abducted by Palestinian militants during the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kaid Alkadi was rescued... in a complex operation in the southern Gaza Strip," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is in a stable medical condition and is being transferred for medical checks to a hospital."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alkadi is a resident of Rahat, a mainly Arab town, and on October 7 he had been working as a guard at a warehouse in southern Israel when he was seized by militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to seizing every opportunity to bring the hostages back to their homes," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the rescue of Alkadi was "miraculous".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we must remember that military operations alone cannot free the remaining hostages who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror," it said, insisting only a ceasefire could ensure the return of other captives", it said adding that "a negotiated deal is the only way forward".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On October 7, militants attacked southern Israeli communities in an unprecedented attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 104 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign since then has killed at least 40,476 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory. Most of the dead are women and children, according to UN rights office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the United Nations said humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip has taken a serious blow after Israel ordered a new evacuation in the centre of the besieged territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday the Israeli military ordered people to "evacuate immediately" a part of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, sparking a rapid exodus of civilians and displacing UN and NGO workers. (AFP)

    Priority for new parents in choosing subsidised homes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The authority's subsidised housing committee chairperson, Cleresa Wong, says she is not worried about the demand for this latest batch of HOS flats. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767870_1_20240827175919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications for more than 7,100 government-subsidised homes will open in the fourth quarter of this year, with households that have newborns being given priority when selecting homes for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new units in the latest round of the Home Ownership Scheme are from five estates – in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Yau Tong, Tung Chung and Tuen Mun – and priced from HK$1.43 million to HK$4.67 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants are expected to be able to select subsidised homes from the second quarter of 2025, which are marked with a 30 percent discount, smaller than the previous batch's offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleresa Wong, who chairs the Housing Authority's subsidised housing committee, said the monthly median income of target buyers has risen, meaning they are more capable of affording such homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also brushed aside concerns that a downturn in the property market would affect the sale of these homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not compare these prices with that in the private market because our target buyers are different. The buyers we want to help are those whom we have determined are unable to purchase a private market flat," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about how popular these homes will be. There are a lot of people who we have to help."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority has also set aside 40 percent of the flats, or 2,900 of them, for ballots from households with elderly members or newborns, who will have priority when choosing their desired homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a bid to boost the city's birth rate, families with children aged three years or younger at the time of application and those who are born on or after October 25 last year will have a better chance of buying subsidised flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said successful applicants with priority are no longer picking from the entire pool of available flats, and instead each housing project will have a set proportion of units for them to choose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”This time, we hope that applicants will have a more reasonable chance of selecting the unit they want," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have noticed that in the past, people with priority tended to prefer homes with better locations and those that are larger."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 10 percent of homes are earmarked for single-person household applicants, Wong added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, families of two or more who are "white form" applicants will be subject to a monthly income ceiling of HK$60,000, from the previous HK$62,000, and an asset limit of HK$1.23 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount will be halved for single-person households.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s export figures have improved for the fifth consecutive month, rising 13.1 percent to HK$390.4 billion in July, when compared to the same month last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Tuesday showed imports rose 9.9 percent year-on-year to HK$412.3 billion, which left the city with a trade deficit of HK$21.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to the mainland, the United States and the European Union continued to rise, while sales to other major Asian markets had a mixed performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combining the figures for the first seven months of the year, exports jumped 12.4 percent year-on-year, while imports rose 8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said Hong Kong's exports should remain positive as long as external demand holds up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the spokesperson added that there are still risks associated with geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts.

    Don't overlook palliative care for children: medics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chan Cheong-wai (bottom second right) says parents often prioritise seeking curative treatments, overlooking palliative care for their children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767858_1_20240827172850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paediatricians and scholars on Tuesday said parents should not overlook palliative care when their children are confronting complex diseases or symptoms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palliative care, which includes end-of-life care, is a specialised type of care aimed at alleviating pain and other symptoms associated with severe illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The call came after researchers at Polytechnic University interviewed 65 people, including children aged between eight and 19 years old, their parents, and medics between 2019 and 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Professor Frances Wong from the university's nursing school said parents need to understand how to live with the life-long diseases their children are facing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The point of treatment and diagnosis is not the end, it's just the beginning. How the parents actually face living with the disease and, therefore, a palliative care model
  <br/>
  actually has the benefits to provide that continuity of care," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that parents can start palliative care for their children even before the diagnosis is complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chan Cheong-wai, who chairs the Hong Kong Society of Children's Palliative Care, said diagnosing intricate illnesses often takes years, but parents often focus on seeking curative treatments, overseeing palliative care for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If a child had cancer, the first thing that the parents may think about will be any kind of curative treatment,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So at that juncture, most of the doctors and nurses will focus on the curative treatment instead of other elements like psychological support. We are not saying that psychological support is not important, but at that time, the parents' main focus is still on the medical side."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children says not many people in the childcare sector are experienced in looking after very young children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767850_1_20240827164639.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) on Tuesday urged the government to provide more support for parents, to boost the city's fertility rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The society said it conducted a survey from May to June involving 1,200 women who had one child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 30 percent said they would have another child, while the rest were either undecided or said they would not have any more children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reasons for ruling out a second child included the financial burden, heavy parenting responsibilities and the difficulty in balancing work and childcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKSPC director Subrina Chow said the government will make available 900 additional places in day childcare services over the next few years, but the number is still inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the long-term development of Hong Kong, in terms of helping more women or adults to be able to join the workforce and helping to increase birth rates so as to address the issues of an ageing population, we feel the government could make further investment in this area because that's going to benefit the society as a whole," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow added that not many people in the childcare sector are experienced in looking after very young children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current programmes provided by our universities and training institutions are all focused on the three to six age range, so we do need a lot more programme content to be devoted to the younger children," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive introduced a HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies in last year's policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chow said parents want "long-term" support instead, so the authorities should consider offering more parental leave as well as child healthcare vouchers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official data shows the number of births in the SAR dropped from 91,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials on Tuesday said a transformed museum documenting the War of Resistance will open to the public next week to showcase relics from the war and the country's history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On September 3, the existing Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence will be renamed the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said officials would work with their Shenzhen counterparts to organise thematic exhibitions on the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The words 'War of Resistance' demonstrate the museum's theme of commemorating the history of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and inheriting the patriotic spirit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also aligns with the high respect for the heroes and martyrs of the War of Resistance and warns future generations to cherish peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression was one of the theatres of World War 2 in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Yui-sum, director of the Museum of History, told reporters there will be new features and performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We aim to organise more exhibitions and public programmes [for] the general public to let them know more about the War of Resistance history and the significance of this period of time, so that they can establish their self-esteem of being a Chinese and to let them know more about their motherland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said in his 2023 Policy Address that the new museum would focus on the war of resistance to cultivate a stronger sense of national esteem and patriotism.

    Britpop band Oasis to reunite next year

<div class="itemFullText">
 Oasis will reunite for a tour, the Britpop band known for their timeless hits like “Wonderwall” and “Don't Look Back in Anger” announced Tuesday, ending a 15-year hiatus and, presumably, the long-held feud between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The guitar band said tickets for the 14-date tour will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday. The tour will begin July 4-5, 2025 in Cardiff, Wales, before moving on to four dates in Manchester, four at London's Wembley stadium, two in Edinburgh and two in Dublin where the tour will conclude on Aug. 17, the band said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is it. This is happening,″ the band said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oasis split in 2009 after many years of infighting, with Noel Gallagher officially leaving the band just before a performance at a festival near Paris. Even before the dissolution, the brothers had long had an antagonistic relationship and reportedly did not speak to each other for years after the breakup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer,” Noel Gallagher, the band's guitarist and songwriter, wrote in a statement at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the Gallagher brothers haven’t performed together since, both regularly perform Oasis songs at their solo gigs. They've also each fired off criticisms of the other in the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noel Gallagher accused his younger brother of having a hangover that forced them to cancel a 2009 concert. The frontman disputed the accusation and sued, later dropping the lawsuit. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Tuesday arrived in Beijing where he will hold talks with senior officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a three-day visit aimed at easing tensions between the two countries ahead of the November presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sullivan's plane landed just before 2pm and was greeted at the airport by US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan wants to expand military-to-military talks between the China and the US down to the theatre command level, a move Washington hopes could help manage tensions in the region.

  Beijing plans to express its disapproval over US tariffs on a range of manufactured goods and export controls targeting Chinese chip makers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US has continuously taken unreasonable measures against China in terms of tariffs, export controls, investment reviews and unilateral sanctions, which have seriously undermined China's legitimate rights and interests," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was charged on Tuesday with sedition over a speech he made that allegedly questioned the integrity of the country's previous king.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin, who led Malaysia from March 2020 until August 2021, pleaded not guilty in a court in northeast Kelantan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the charge sheet, Muhyiddin made the seditious remarks last month during a by-election campaign in Kelantan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine ethnic Malay state rulers take turns as Malaysia’s king for five-year terms under the country’s rotating monarchy, which began when Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but are revered by the nation's majority Muslims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his speech on August 14, Muhyiddin had questioned why then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah didn't invite him to be prime minister following a hung Parliament in November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin had claimed he had the backing of majority lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin's Islamic nationalistic bloc received stronger-than-expected support from Malays, who account for two-thirds of Malaysia’s 34 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah appointed then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister after Anwar cobbled up support from rival parties to form a unity government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah from central Pahang state, who ended his reign in January this year, didn't comment on the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his son issued a strong rebuke to Muhyiddin, saying his remarks were dangerous and could divide the people and undermine the royal institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin was questioned by police following complaints against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied insulting the royalty, saying his remarks were factual and that he had handed in a sworn oath of support by 115 lawmakers in the 222-member parliament. (AP)

    HKU to trial use of sound waves to treat cancer

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong's faculty of medicine says it is planning the first clinical trials in Asia of a device designed to treat cancer with sound waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty liver cancer patients will be given histotripsy treatment at Queen Mary Hospital from September, the faculty said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The histotripsy is basically a very high-focus ultrasound that basically induces a sudden expansion and collapse of the cancer cells… and that creates a shock wave and that basically would break down the cancer cells and we call it liquefying the cancer cells. That would completely kill the cancer cells,” said professor Albert Chan from the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And what is so different from the usual treatment is actually the minimally invasiveness. So without any scars, any wounds, we can now treat the patients... This is a non-radiation treatment, so we can actually apply it to a broad spectrum of patients.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Hong Kong, with about 1,700 to 1,800 new cases per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mike Blue – a representative of the manufacturer of the machine involved – said the technology could be used to treat most cancers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This particular system has been designed in the future to treat everywhere really from the neck down. So we envision years from now, histotripsy and this particular system will be used to treat thyroid, breast, sarcomas, liver, kidney, pancreas, really anywhere in the body,” the HistoSonics CEO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue added that the treatment is also effective on recurrent cancer patients, adding that it has already been used in the US on those with early and advanced stages of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that after the clinical trial on liver cancer at HKU is completed in about two years, the team plans to carry out clinical studies in the SAR for other types of cancer, including kidney and pancreatic cancer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of Macau's Court of Final Appeal, Sam Hou-fai, will meet the press tomorrow to formally declare his bid to become the SAR's top leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tuesday marked his last day as head and member of the top court of the casino hub, as well as a member of the Independent Commission on the Recommendation of Judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng removed Sam from his duties, as per his request, with the removal order taking effect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam had earlier expressed his interest in running to become Macau's next chief executive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Ho announced last Wednesday that he would not run for a second term due to health reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nomination period for candidates begins on Thursday, with the election to be held on October 13.
