    Vu wins LPGA Meijer Classic after playoff thriller

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lilia Vu staged a sensational final round charge before snatching victory in a playoff to win the LPGA Meijer Classic in Michigan on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vu fired a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 at Blythefield Country Club in suburban Grand Rapids to finish with a 72-hole 16-under-par aggregate of 272.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was good enough to send the two-time major champion into a sudden-death playoff with Lexi Thompson and Australia's Grace Kim, who wilted over the final 18 holes after leading by five shots after Saturday's third round. Kim advanced to the playoff after a closing one-over 73.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three women all grabbed birdies on the first playoff hole, the par-five 18th, and then repeated the trio of birdies after replaying 18 for the second playoff hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On both occasions Kim had difficult eagle putts to snatch victory but was unable to convert either. The third playoff hole headed to the par-five fourth, and it was Vu who kept her nerve as the tension mounted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old from California looked to be in trouble after sending her second shot into a greenside bunker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a brilliant sand wedge left her with a short birdie putt, and after Thompson and Kim missed their birdie chances, she duly rolled in the six-footer to clinch the fifth LPGA title of her career. (AFP)

    DeChambeau edges McIlroy by one stroke to win US Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bryson DeChambeau celebrates with the U.S. Open trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757721_1_20240617082133.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau captured his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy by one stroke in a dramatic back-nine duel at Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old American, who also won the 2020 US Open, fired a one-over-par 71 to finish on six-under-par 274 while McIlroy shot 69 to stand on 275 after 72 holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, thwarted in a bid to end a 10-year major win drought, led by two strokes with five holes to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland made bogeys on three of the last four holes to help hand the trophy to DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a collapse mindful of Greg Norman's epic 1996 last-round loss to Nick Faldo at Pinehurst, McIlroy missed par putts from 2.5 feet at the par-3 17th and just inside four feet at the par-4 18th -- tension-packed misses for bogeys that left McIlroy one behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau found dirt and weeds left and a bunker at 18 but blasted his third shot to four feet and sank his pressure-packed putt for the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raising his arms in triumph, DeChambeau screamed and jumped for joy, then paid tribute to the late Payne Stewart, the 1999 US Open winner at Pinehurst who died only a few months later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's Payne right there, baby," DeChambeau said into a television camera, pointing to a pin of Stewart on his cap. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's Jude Bellingham celebrates scoring their first goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757720_1_20240617081811.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England got their quest for a first major tournament title in 58 years off to a winning start as Jude Bellingham's header was enough to beat Serbia 1-0, while the Netherlands grabbed a late 2-1 win over Poland on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Christian Eriksen enjoyed a fairytale return to the European Championship, three years after suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch, by scoring the opening goal, but Denmark were held 1-1 by Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England had been hyped as one of the favourites for the tournament as Gareth Southgate aims to finally steer a richly-talented generation to glory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they left plenty of room for improvement in a flat tournament debut in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham was the exception as the Real Madrid midfielder confirmed his status as one of the world's rising stars with a man-of-the-match display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first half showed why we can score goals against any team and the second half showed why we can keep clean sheets against any team," said Bellingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old became the first European player to grace three major tournaments before turning 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he capped a brilliant individual display with the only goal when he headed in Bukayo Saka's deflected cross on 13 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were forced to see out a nervy finale as Jordan Pickford turned over Dusan Vlahovic's dipping drive before Harry Kane headed away Veljko Birmancevic's goalbound shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the Netherlands, Wout Weghorst struck in the 83rd minute, just two minutes after coming on as a substitute, to secure an opening Group D victory against Poland, who were without the injured Robert Lewandowski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the Poland supporters whose voices echoed around the Volksparkstadion when Adam Buksa headed their team in front early on, but Cody Gakpo levelled an entertaining encounter before the half-hour mark with the aid of a deflection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo, Memphis Depay and Denzel Dumfries all went close as the missed chances piled up for the Oranje, and Ronald Koeman's men looked to be running out of ideas until Weghorst swooped to slot home a deserved winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksen collapsed during Denmark's opening game at the delayed Euro 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exactly 1,100 days on, the Manchester United midfielder put the Danes in front with a sweet strike in Stuttgart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do think this time my story at the Euros is very different from the last one," said Eriksen. (AFP)

    S Africa's Zuma vows to fight 'rigged' elections
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jacob Zuma, a stern expression on his face, sat quietly as his speech was read out. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757709_1_20240617044538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South African former president Jacob Zuma said on Sunday his new party would join an opposition alliance to coordinate resistance to the government, while maintaining its challenge to the general election results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The 2024 elections were rigged" the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela said, reading out a statement on behalf of the 82-year-old ex-leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have instructed our legal team to take any steps possible both inside of South Africa and internationally to ensure that justice is done."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he added: "At the right time we will call on our people to demonstrate their dissatisfaction against all these injustices peacefully, in the streets, in the court and even in parliament until our grievances are addressed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK also said it would join a newly formed parliamentary grouping that includes several mostly leftist opposition parties represented in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Called the "Progressive Caucus" it is currently led by the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which won 39 seats in the new parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma, a stern expression on his face, sat quietly as his speech was read out, occasionally answering questions from the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK came third in the election, winning 14.6 percent of the vote and 58 parliamentary seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the party boycotted the country's first parliamentary sitting where Zuma's long-term political foe Cyril Ramaphosa was re-elected as president for a second term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party announced it had launched a fresh court bid to dispute the "rigged" election results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had already gone to court to try to prevent the new parliament from convening, and lodged a separate complaint over alleged election irregularities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other parties have also complained to the country's electoral body and lodged legal complaints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa, who will be inaugurated on June 19, will lead what he calls a government of national unity after the May poll produced no outright winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national unity government includes the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and other smaller groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal got a frosty reception from the opposition parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndhlela for the MK denounced the new coalition as a "white-led unholy alliance" that "must be crushed before it finds its feet." He accused the ANC of going to "bed with the racists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EFF dismissed the idea of working with rivals holding radically different political views, such as the DA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma has been a bitter rival of Ramaphosa's ever since he was ousted by his own party, the African National Congress (ANC), under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018 and replaced by Rampaphosa. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer who tried to intercept a fleeing cow by hitting it with a vehicle in England has been removed from duty, police said in a statement on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The incident occurred on Friday evening after police were called to a sighting of a cow in a residential area of the small town of Staines-upon-Thames in southern England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surrey Police on Sunday said that the officer driving the car had been "removed from frontline duties pending the outcome of these investigations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp of Surrey Police said: "I fully appreciate the distress our handling of this incident has caused and will ensure that it is thoroughly and diligently investigated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published on social media and in the British press showed a police car hitting the animal twice. The cow ended up with its head and upper body trapped under the police car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can think of no reasonable need for this action. I've asked for a full, urgent explanation for this. It appears to be unnecessarily heavy handed," Home Secretary James Cleverly wrote on X, formally Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, police said that after several unsuccessful attempts to recover the cow and taking public safety into account, a decision was made to intercept the cow using the police vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10-month-old cow, christened "Beau Lucy," was examined by a vet and reunited with its owner who said the animal was "doing better." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German police shot and injured a man after he threatened passers-by and officers with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail ahead of a Euro 2024 match in Hamburg on Sunday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At around midday on Sunday (1000 GMT), a man threatened several passers-by and police officers with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail," police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police then shot and injured the attacker, who "may have been having a psychiatric crisis," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamburg was thronging with football fans at the time ahead of the Euro 2024 match between Poland and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, police said there was no indication of a link to the Euro 2024 clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man came out of a snack bar holding the weapons and approached passers-by and police at the scene "in a threatening manner," the police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he did not comply with a request to put them down, police shot at him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesman said he was shot in the leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was treated by first-aiders at the scene and then taken to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect has been identified as a 39-year-old German man, the police said, adding that his motive was not known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said earlier on X, formerly Twitter, that the incident had triggered a "major operation" in the city's St Pauli district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It happened near the Reeperbahn station, more than a kilometre away from the city's official football fan zone. (AFP)

    Israel announces daily Gaza 'pause' for aid deliveries

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gazans hold Eid al-Adha prayers by the ruins of the Al-Rahma mosque. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757699_1_20240617002227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military said on Sunday it would "pause" fighting around a south Gaza route daily to facilitate aid deliveries, following months of warnings of famine in the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement of a "local, tactical pause of military activity" during daylight hours in an area of Rafah came a day after eight Israeli soldiers were killed in a blast near the far-southern city and three more troops died elsewhere, in one of the heaviest losses for the army in its war against Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations welcomed the Israeli move, although "this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need," said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, calling for "further concrete measures" on aid needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Gazans "urgently need food, water, sanitation, shelter, and healthcare, with many living near piles of solid waste, heightening health risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be able to deliver aid safely throughout Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN agencies and aid groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm of dire shortages of food and other essentials in the Gaza Strip, exacerbated by overland access restrictions and the closure of the key Rafah crossing with Egypt since Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has long defended its efforts to let aid into Gaza including via its Kerem Shalom border near Rafah, blaming militants for looting supplies and humanitarian workers for failing to distribute them to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes will take place from 8:00 am (0500 GMT) until 7:00 pm (1600 GMT) every day until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Salah al-Din road and then northwards," a military statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A map released by the army showed the declared humanitarian route extending until Rafah's European Hospital, about 10 kilometres from Kerem Shalom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came as Muslims worldwide mark Eid al-Adha, but there is little to celebrate in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no joy. We have been robbed of it," said Malakiya Salman, a 57-year-old displaced woman, now living in a tent in Khan Younis city in the southern Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gazans, like Muslims the world over, would usually slaughter sheep for the holiday – whose Arabic name means "feast of the sacrifice" – and share the meat with the needy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents would also gift children new clothes and money in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses in Gaza's north and centre reported no fighting on Sunday morning, though there was some shelling and at least one strike in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military stressed in a statement there was "no cessation of hostilities in the southern Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the pause was already in effect and part of efforts to "increase the volumes of humanitarian aid" following discussions with the UN and other organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, which has been pressing close ally Israel as well as Hamas to accept a ceasefire plan laid out by President Joe Biden, on Friday imposed sanctions on an extremist Israeli group for blocking and attacking Gaza-bound aid convoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the eight soldiers killed on Saturday were hit by an explosion as they were travelling in an armoured vehicle near Rafah, where troops were engaged in fierce street battles against Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the blast was "apparently from an explosive device planted in the area or from the firing of an anti-tank missile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, two soldiers were killed in fighting in northern Gaza and another succumbed to wounds inflicted in recent fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses brought the Israeli military's overall toll to 309 deaths since it began its its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his condolences following "this terrible loss" and said that "despite the heavy and unsettling price, we must cling to the goals of the war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas following the Palestinian group's unprecedented October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.

  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,337 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of countries said on Sunday that Ukraine's "territorial integrity" should be respected in any peace deal to end the war, as they said "dialogue between all parties" would be necessary for a lasting settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a final communique issued at the end of a major two-day diplomatic summit in Switzerland, the vast majority of countries also backed a call for the full exchange of captured soldiers and return of deported Ukrainian children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not all attendees backed the document, with India, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates among those not included in a list of supporting states displayed on screens at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that reaching peace requires the involvement of and dialogue between all parties," the document stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "We reaffirm our commitment to ... the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognised borders."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 countries had gathered in the Swiss resort of Burgenstock for the summit, dedicated to discussing Kyiv's proposals for a route out of the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow was not invited and has rejected the summit as "absurd" and pointless.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv had worked hard to secure attendance from countries that maintain warm relations with Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final document also called for all prisoners of war to be released in a "complete exchange" and for all Ukrainian children who had been "deported and unlawfully displaced" to be returned to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv accuses Russia of abducting almost 20,000 children from parts of the east and south of the country that its forces took control of.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Working groups at the summit also addressed the issues of global food security and nuclear safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Food security must not be weaponised in any way," the declaration stated, adding that access to ports in the Black and Azov Seas was "critical" for global food supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the countries also called for Ukraine to have "full sovereign control" over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located in the south of Ukraine, the facility is Europe's largest nuclear energy site and has been controlled by Russian forces since early in the war. (AFP)

    At least 19 hajj pilgrims dead in Saudi Arabia

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 Jordanian and Iranian pilgrims have died while on the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, authorities from their countries said on Sunday, as temperatures soar in the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "14 Jordanian pilgrims died and 17 others were missing" during the performance of hajj rituals, Jordan's foreign ministry said in a statement, not specifying their cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand said "five Iranian pilgrims have lost their lives so far in Mecca and Medina during the hajj this year," also not saying how they died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hajj, one of the world's biggest religious gatherings, is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must perform it at least once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures have pushed well past 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) during the annual pilgrimage that around 1.8 million Muslims are taking part in this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the rituals are performed outdoors and on foot, creating challenges especially among the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not provided any information on fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the kingdom has implemented heat mitigation measures, including climate-controlled areas, distributes water, and offers advice to pilgrims on protecting themselves from the sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During last year's hajj at least 240 people – many from Indonesia – died, according to figures announced by various countries which also did not specify causes of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10,000 heat-related illnesses were recorded last year, 10 percent of them heat stroke, a Saudi official said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Saudi study said regional temperatures were rising 0.4 C each decade, and worsening heat may be outpacing mitigation measures. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of erectile dysfunction pills, anti-depressants and other psychotropic drugs have been seized in Hong Kong this month with four people arrested on suspicion of running a medication mail service without a permit, customs officers said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 1.4 million pills, found in a remote village house in Mui Wo and at a subdivided factory unit in San Po Kong, are believed to be worth around HK$80 million in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the hauls mostly comprised of generic drugs from India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's believed the pills were being posted to dozens of places around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior customs investigator, Hong Yan, said they were looking into whether the two cases are linked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that the two syndicates operate in a very similar fashion. They both rented a unit as a centre for packaging and storing the medicines," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They also hired foreigners to package and post the medicines overseas. Furthermore, inside the units, the ways the drugs were categorised and stored were very similar."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said two women arrested in Mui Wo at the start of the month had since been released on bail, while two women arrested in San Po Kong were still in detention.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifteen men and five women have been arrested on suspicion of loan sharking and illegal debt collection, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said that during an operation, officers seized HK$300,000 in cash, bank cards, phones, computers and debt collection notes, as well as cars and watches suspected to be the proceeds of crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said more than a million dollars was loaned to nine people in Sau Mau Ping in recent months, and a group threatened and harassed those who failed to repay the money on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our intelligence indicated that the syndicate used various illegal debt collecting methods, including splashing red paint to debtors’ flats, damaging the door locks and criminal intimidation to force the debtors to repay their loans,” said Inspector Leung Ho-ching.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police added that they have identified a bank account linked to the case that was allegedly used to launder at least HK$5.8 million.

    Tenants cautiously back idea of subdivided flat purge

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said a survey it has carried out suggests the majority of people living in poor housing support the government's goal of ridding the city of low-quality subdivided units, but they're also concerned about where they would move to if it happens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Caritas Community Development Service said it spoke to 231 tenants of subdivided flats and cubic apartments from December to April, and found that 70 percent think the government should regulate low-quality subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 60 percent said they worry they wouldn't be able to find an affordable home if such a move was taken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They think that if the government takes the action to regulate subdivided housing, it means that there would be fewer subdivided flats in the urban areas. So they may need to afford a higher rent, and they may not find suitable units," said Kelvin Lee, a social worker with the NGO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government's Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units has been asked to come up with proposals on minimum living standards for such homes, as well as how those that are substandard can be eradicated altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, officials announced that applications for Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing will open from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee said single non-elderly people are less likely to secure a place under a points system that prioritises families living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The social worker added that building more public housing is the long-term solution to the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to consider using the vacant land reserve to build more public housing, especially in the urban areas, since most of the low-income talents are living in those urban areas, which is near their jobs and schools for the children," Lee said.

 Hong Kong windsurfer Hayley Chan has won a bronze medal in the wing foil European Championships in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She defeated French windsurfer Anais Mai Desjardins by 11 points in the final to come third, with two Italian athletes above Chan on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan, 33, beat fellow SAR athlete Ngai Wai-yan in the previous round. Ngai finished fifth in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Windsurfing Association of Hong Kong, China said this was Chan's first go at the European Championships, having twice been an Asian champion. She's also a two-time Olympian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association said two others it sponsored in the race, Rafeek Kikabhoy and Chow Tsz-hei, finished 13th and 18th respectively in the men's race. Another Hongkonger, Era Lin, meanwhile, came 26th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes will return to the SAR after the competition to prepare for the wing foil world cup in August, the association said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Sunday said more than half of shop operators it spoke to in Kowloon City want to move back to the neighbourhood after a makeover designed to beautify the area and preserve its culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing project, covering three sections of Carpenter Road and Nga Tsin Wai Road, will see Kowloon City wet market relocated and some of its surrounding areas demolished to make way for more than 4,000 new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, wrote on his blog that the URA held 15 meetings with wet market food vendors and Thai restaurant operators to brief them on relocation and transitional arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They shared with the team that they have been doing business in the "Dragon City" district for many years and are attached to the district, hoping to pass on the friendship," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some operators also hope to pass on the regional characteristics to the next generation through the relocation arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said the authority will reserve some shops for these vendors after the area is rebuilt and offer concessionary rent for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA earlier said it hopes the new Kowloon City Market can be completed by 2030 while most of the other proposed facilities can be ready by 2037.

    Officials greet first overnight high-speed trains

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first overnight high-speed trains from Beijing and Shanghai to Hong Kong arrived on Sunday morning, with tourism minister Kevin Yeung saying passengers were generally positive about the “sleep and arrive” arrangement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung and MTR CEO Jacob Kam welcomed passengers at Hong Kong West Kowloon Station and handed out souvenirs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourism chief said passengers told him they thought it was good to be able to sleep on the train and arrive refreshed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe it provides an extra option. In the past, most travellers from Shanghai and Beijing would choose to take a plane. Even if they took high-speed trains, that would be during daytime,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now that the option of taking an overnight train is available, passengers can make better use of their time. They can sleep on the train and when they arrive in Hong Kong in the morning they can do the things they want. They have a whole day to travel.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger from Shanghai, who brought his son along to experience a sleeper train for the first time, said he was satisfied with the facilities, but his son had trouble sleeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The noise level is a bit high. Otherwise it's quite good. There's no problem for an individual to fall asleep. During the trip the train passed through some tunnels that generated a big noise," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kam said while demand for the first few trains was really positive, it is still too early to discuss the possibility of increasing the frequency of services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to consider the passenger needs and the needs for various destinations. Also we need to consider that the sleeper trains pass through various railway tracks and they require maintenance. We need to strive a balance between maintenance work and the passenger need,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the first Beijing-bound sleeper train from Hong Kong arrived in the capital on Sunday morning. Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, said he really enjoyed his meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I had grilled beef with king trumpet mushroom rice. The portion of the beef is quite large and there are many varieties of the side dishes. There are vegetables, meat and sauce, and the rice is also warm. Therefore I highly recommend it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he was not worried that the new services will encourage more tourists not to stay in a hotel when they visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four sleeper trains run every Friday to Monday night, with two travelling from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Beijing and two going in the opposite direction.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong officials on Sunday celebrated Father's Day by sharing stories about them and their children, as they wished all dads a good day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee posted a photo online of a card his son made him decades ago when he nominated him for a "top ten modern day father" award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he felt warm and proud to see it again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife had written a message on the card saying "although he is very busy with work, he spends time every week chit-chatting with me. He also encouraged me to take part in more community work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said it was unfortunate he couldn't attend the fathers' award ceremony at the time because of work, and nowadays he also loses time with his family because he is busy in the office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Lee thanked his family for supporting him so he can focus on work and make good policies for the people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he spent the weekend playing football with several fathers and their sons, saying many fathers are often too busy to play with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan wrote on his weekly blog that the government has been putting a lot of resources into sports facilities in recent years, from five-a-side football pitches to the Kai Tak Sports Park, which will be the biggest ever sports infrastructure project in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the park is due to open in the middle of next year and said it should hopefully bring business opportunities as well as spectacular sport and other performances for locals and tourists alike.

    At least nine hurt in Michigan shooting: police

<div class="itemFullText">
 A shooter has opened fire at a water park in the US state of Michigan, wounding nine or more people including at least one child, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The local sheriff's office said it potentially had the suspect contained near the scene of the shooting in Rochester Hills, a suburb of Detroit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears like the individual pulled up, exited a vehicle, approached the splash pad, opened fire. Reloaded, opened fire. Reloaded. Left. So it appears very random at this point," Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County told reporters, adding he believed the shooter had "no connectivity to the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said preliminary information indicated there were nine to 10 victims of varying ages, including one eight-year-old child. Several hospitals have received patients, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Glock handgun and empty magazines were recovered at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Bouchard, "we believe we have an individual who's a suspect contained nearby."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that assets including SWAT teams and armoured vehicles have been deployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she was "heartbroken" to learn of the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials," she said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun violence in the United States is common, and thousands of Americans are killed each year in shootings. Efforts at broad reforms to the nation's gun laws have been stymied for decades. (AFP)

    DeChambeau moves three shots clear at US Open
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1757636-20240616.htm

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bryson DeChambeau lines up a putt at the seventh hole. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757636_1_20240616093816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau brushed off hip issues to move three shots clear at the top of the US Open third round leaderboard on Saturday, setting up a potential mouth-watering showdown with world number three Rory McIlroy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On another steamy afternoon at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, DeChambeau recovered from an early bogey and troublesome hip that required treatment mid-round to return a three-under 67 to lead Frenchman Matthieu Pavon (69), Patrick Cantlay (70) and McIlroy (69) by three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sitting a further two back and five off the pace are Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (70) and young Swede Ludvig Aberg (73), who had held a one shot lead after the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Trying to stay in the moment, obviously hip wasn't feeling great but luckily I've got a good team and we're going to go figure that out after," said DeChambeau. "I just got two hips that are not fantastic just because of the speed training I do that's the consequences of it but I'll be ready tomorrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had it for a long time now. It's just something that popped up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau will be partnered with Pavon for Sunday's final round but it is McIlroy, paired with Cantlay, who he will share the spotlight with as the former-U.S. Open winners and two of golf's most intriguing figures grapple for the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, bidding to end a decade-long major drought, may be one of golf's most popular figures but the big-hitting DeChambeau has evolved into one of the most entertaining and has enjoyed the backing of huge crowds at Pinehurst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be some golf politics and bragging rights at stake on Sunday with 2020 U.S. Open winner DeChambeau now playing on the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour and McIlroy, long one of the most vocal critics of the renegade circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will mark the 10th time McIlroy has appeared in the top three going into the final round of a major while DeChambeau has played some of the best golf at the biggest events, finishing runner-up at last month's PGA Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking forward to another Sunday in the mix at a major," said McIlroy, who won the last of his four majors at the PGA Championship in 2014. "Awesome opportunity, really excited to be in the position I am in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is what we practice for, this is what we dream of, so really excited for the opportunity, going to go out there tomorrow and give it my all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau broke away from the leading pack with a birdie at the 10th but on his way to the 11th was stretched out on the ground having work done on his hip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any concerns about fitness were quickly dispelled when DeChambeau stepped onto the tee and hammered his longest drive of day at 359-yards before draining a 13-footer for back-to-back birdies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau extended his advantage to four with his third birdie in five holes at the 14th but just when it appeared he might run away from the field was pulled back with a double bogey at the 16th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old responded immediately, rolling in a 12-footer for his sixth birdie triggering wild cheers and chants of "USA, USA".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was amazing," gushed DeChambeau of the fan support. "Man, they riled me up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just gives me a spike in my adrenaline and allows me to focus more on delivering for the fans and for myself and for my family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just inspires me." (Reuters)

    England stay alive in T20 World Cup with rain-hit win

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Harry Brook smashes another six to keep England alive in the T20 World Cup. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757626_1_20240616070037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning champions England maintained their bid to reach the second round of the T20 World Cup with a 41-run victory in a must-win group game against Namibia in Antigua on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anything other than an England win would have seen Jos Buttler's men knocked out and they were left fearing an early exit when rain delayed the scheduled start by three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, in a match eventually reduced from 11 to 10 overs per side by a fresh downpour, collapsed to 13-2 after losing the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a stand of 56 between the Yorkshire duo of Harry Brook (47 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (31) revived England's innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namibia were left with a target of 126 under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for rain-interrupted matches. But the non-Test nation were never up with the required run-rate and finished on 84-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory took England level on points with Scotland in Group B but with a superior net run-rate – the tie-breaker for teams on equal points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, however, could still be knocked out should Scotland achieve a stunning upset win over already-qualified Australia in the final Group B fixture in St Lucia later on Saturday, or if that game ends in a no-result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Ruben Trumpelmann bowled England captain Buttler, one of the world's best white-ball batsman, for a four-ball duck as he nipped one back sharply off the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran all-rounder David Wiese then produced a magnificent slower ball to have Phil Salt, England's other opener, caught behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain stopped play with England 82-3 off eight overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the match resumed, Brook did the damage in an over from Namibia teenage paceman Jack Brassell, which cost 19 runs, before Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone struck three sixes between them in the last over from Trumpelmann (2-31).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The already-eliminated Namibia retired opener Nikolaas Davin out for 18 to allow the big-hitting Wiese to come in at 44-1 off six overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even with the 39-year-old Wiese – who holed out in the last over of his final international appearance – hitting two sixes and two fours in a 12-ball 27, Namibia finished well-short of their target. (AFP)

    Italy recover to beat Albania, Spain cruise

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nedim Bajrami celebrates scoring the fastest goal ever at a European Chaampionship. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757622_1_20240616064233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy recovered from conceding the fastest goal in the competition's history to get their defence of the European Championship title off to a winning start on Saturday as they came back to beat Albania 2-1 in front of a partisan crowd.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nedim Bajrami stunned the Italians and delighted a huge Albanian support in Dortmund as he smashed in the opener after just 23 seconds, his strike pulverising the previous record for the quickest goal at the Euros of 67 seconds by Dmitri Kirichenko of Russia in 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet Italy's response to falling behind was quick too, as Alessandro Bastoni headed the Azzurri level on 11 minutes and Nicolo Barella's glorious effort put them ahead just past the quarter-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From then on Luciano Spalletti's team looked much more assured, although they really should have won by a greater margin rather than face an anxious finale as Albania pushed for an equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their performance – the first 23 seconds apart – was largely encouraging before an enticing showdown with fellow heavyweights Spain in nearby Gelsenkirchen next Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy are in some ways an unknown quantity coming into this tournament, with the reigning champions having also missed the last two World Cups and failed to fully convince during qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five of Italy's line-up at kick-off here started the final of the last Euros three years ago, with a new-look team featuring Bologna centre-back Riccardo Calafiori winning just his third cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albania, though, are appearing at just their second major tournament having also gone to Euro 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The novelty of the experience for them helps explain why the home of Borussia Dortmund was a sea of excitable Albanian fans decked in red and black who made up the vast majority of the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They could hardly believe it when their team, coached by the Brazilian former Arsenal and Barcelona left-back Sylvinho, opened the scoring almost straight from kick-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's Federico Dimarco took a throw from the left-back position but played it loosely back into his own box. Bastoni was caught on the back foot, and Bajrami – who plays in Italy for Sassuolo – pounced to control and fire past Gianluigi Donnarumma at the goalkeeper's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar start to Italy's last European Championship match, when Luke Shaw put England ahead inside two minutes in the final at Wembley in 2021 before the Azzurri came back to win on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time they drew level when Dimarco and Lorenzo Pellegrini played a short corner routine on the left before the latter crossed for Inter Milan centre-back Bastoni to head in at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy had regained their composure and soon went in front on 16 minutes, a Jasir Asani clearance dropping straight to another Inter player in Barella, who made the cleanest of contacts at the edge of the area to send a first-time shot past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They should have added to their lead before the interval, with Davide Frattesi hitting the post after meeting a lovely reverse pass by Gianluca Scamacca in the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scamacca was then denied by Strakosha, while Fedrico Chiesa curled a shot just wide on the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy then sat back, but Albania did not manage another attempt on target and the second-lowest ranked nation in the competition could not find an equaliser despite their best efforts late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Rey Manaj came closest after getting in behind in the 90th minute, but he could not beat Donnarumma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Spain made a dream start to Euro 2024 as Alvaro Morata scored in a statement 3-0 victory over Croatia in Berlin, with Lamine Yamal becoming the youngest player in the competition's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time European champions have often been accused of being toothless in attack during recent major tournaments, but produced an eye-catching display at the Olympiastadion to cut apart a disappointing Croatia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morata broke the deadlock in the 29th minute with his seventh Euros goal, moving joint-third on the all-time list alongside Alan Shearer and Antoine Griezmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fabian Ruiz added a second shortly afterwards with a wonderful individual strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal made his mark with the assist for Dani Carvajal to effectively kill the game as a contest on the stroke of half-time, while Croatia striker Bruno Petkovic missed a late penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This repeat of last year's Nations League final, won by Spain on penalties after a 0-0 draw, suggests La Roja are capable of contending for a record-breaking fourth European Championship title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Cup semi-finalists Croatia, though, have it all to do if they are to reach the knockout phase for a fifth consecutive major tournament, with games against Albania and holders Italy to come in a difficult Group B.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luka Modric, so often their inspiration, was substituted midway through the second half by coach Zlatko Dalic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain boss Luis de la Fuente named an exciting starting XI, including wingers Nico Williams and Yamal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Barcelona starlet, 16 years and 338 days old, beat the previous record for youngest player at a Euros held by Polish international Kacper Kozlowski, who played at Euro 2020 at 17 years and 246 days old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia enjoyed the vast majority of support from the stands, with their fans holding up one huge banner during their national anthem, reading "When we get going, heaven and earth will burn".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Croatia started slowly, as Spain dominated possession in trademark fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain also showed their increasing versatility under De la Fuente with their first goal, as one excellent through ball from inside his own half by Ruiz sent Morata clean through and the captain made no mistake with a cool finish past a stranded Dominik Livakovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz put Spain in total control just three minutes later, jinking past two Croatia defenders inside the box before shooting through the legs of Josip Sutalo and into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia almost pulled one back immediately as the game started to echo the end-to-end nature of the two teams' thrilling last-16 clash at Euro 2020, won 5-3 by Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon got down quickly to keep out Marcelo Brozovic's shot and Lovro Majer could only find the side-netting from the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia continued to create chances, as Josko Gvardiol's cross-cum-shot narrowly avoided both Ante Budimir in the centre and the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But full-back Carvajal, who scored the opening goal in Real Madrid's Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund earlier this month, put the game to bed in first-half added time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal collected the ball after a corner was cleared and curled a delicious cross into the middle for Carvajal to stretch and stab home on the volley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia tried to press forward early in the second period but left spaces for Spain to exploit and Yamal was denied another record for youngest Euros scorer when Livakovic produced a fine save to turn away his low effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Cucurella, a controversial selection by De la Fuente at left-back, made a goal-saving block to prevent Josip Stanisic giving Croatia hope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Petkovic thought he had pulled one back late on when he tapped in after his penalty was saved by Simon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the goal was ruled out by VAR for encroachment by Ivan Perisic as Spain added a clean sheet to an almost perfect outing. (AFP)

 Some 250,000 people took to the streets across France on Saturday to protest the rise of the far right after their success in European polls prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call legislative elections, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police estimated 75,000 people had responded to a call from unions, associations and a new left-wing political coalition formed for the parliamentary elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CGT union put the figure at 640,000 protesters at a total of 182 rallies including 250,000 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Bayonne in the southwest to Nice in the southeast, from Vannes in the west to Reims in the east, demonstrators mobilised against the prospect of a victory for the far right in the legislative elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If that were to happen, National Rally (RN) party leader Jordan Bardella could become prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I would never see the far right come to power and now it could happen," said Florence David, 60, who took part in the Paris protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No need to vote RN to love France," was among the slogans used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marches took place mostly in calm, apart from a few brief episodes of tension in Rennes and Nantes in western France where a few dozen hard-left activists were pushed back by the police with tear gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, street infrastructure was damaged and a bank branch was targeted by hooded protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police there were also the target of bottles thrown to which they responded with tear gas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China have posted their third straight win in the FIVB Women’s Volleyball Nations League being held in Hong Kong, rallying past the world’s top-ranked side Turkey on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China lost the first two sets 21-25, 17-25 before staging their comeback, taking the next three sets 25-21, 25-23, 15-13 to win 3-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Cai Bin called it a team victory. China next play Poland on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese women’s volleyball team have already qualified for the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss by Turkey means Brazil have replaced them as the world’s No 1 team.

    Israel army says eight soldiers killed in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said eight soldiers were killed in Gaza on Saturday when the armoured vehicle they were in exploded, in one of the deadliest blows for the army since the war began in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Captain Wassem Mahmud, 23, and seven other soldiers "fell during operational activity in southern Gaza," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their families have been notified."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked if the soldiers died when the Namer armoured vehicle they were travelling in exploded, a military press desk officer said: "Yes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said the explosion struck near Gaza's far-southern city of Rafah, where troops are engaged in fierce street battles with Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses were among the heaviest for the military since it began its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-one soldiers were killed on January 22 when rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire hit a tank near two buildings where they were carrying out an operation, the military said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buildings exploded as troops had planted explosives in them after the structures had been identified as "terrorist infrastructure" in the area, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's deaths take to 306 the military's losses since October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,296 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Aberg chases win in US Open debut, Scheffler struggles
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ludvig Aberg could become the first golfer in 111 years to win the US Open on his debut. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757610_1_20240616003007.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ludvig Aberg, trying to become the first US Open debut winner since 1913, carried a one-stroke lead into Saturday's third round at Pinehurst, where top-ranked Scottie Scheffler was 11 strokes adrift.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's sixth-ranked Aberg stood on five-under 135 as he awaited a 3:35 p.m. (1935 GMT) start alongside 2020 US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a runner-up effort in last month's PGA Championship, DeChambeau was among eight of 12 LIV Golf starters among the 74 players who made the cut for the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also one stroke off the pace with DeChambeau on 136 were ninth-ranked American Patrick Cantlay and Belgium's Thomas Detry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland was another shot back on 137 with American Tony Finau and France's Matthieu Pavon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner takes US$4.3 million and the runner-up a hefty US$2.32 million from the record US$21.5 million purse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Aberg, runner-up at April's Masters in his major debut, could carry off a bit of history as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not since 20-year-old American amateur Francis Ouimet upset Britain's Harry Vardon and Ted Ray at The Country Club in his hometown of Brookline, Massachusetts, some 111 years ago has a player won the US Open on his debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Swede has had triumphs on the US PGA Tour and DP World Tour since turning professional a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A major reason for his lead at punishing Pinehurst, with its dome-shaped elevated greens and dirt and weeds waste areas, is that he leads all players in both driving accuracy at 93 percent and greens in regulation at 83 percent, mainly avoiding the course's two major danger zones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best any Swedish player has done in a US Open is fourth, a feat managed by Niclas Fasth, Robert Karlson and Henrik Stenson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scheffler, the hottest golfer entering the week and a huge favourite, was six-over and 11 strokes back after a bogey at the par-4 fourth, finding native area left off the tee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler made the cut on the number following a 74 on Friday but was 1-over after seven holes on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was the first player since Tom Watson in 1980 to win five US PGA Tour events before the US Open, taking the fifth last week at the Memorial, and has 12 top-10 finishes in 13 events this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The usually stoic and calm Scheffler, however, could feel the frustration at Pinehurst's unique challenge, flipping his putter in the air and letting it fall after one near miss on Friday and also slamming down his driver after a woefully errant tee shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay, in his best spot after 36 holes in 30 major starts, has a chance to move past Collin Morikawa for the final spot on the US team for the Paris Olympics but needs no worse than a two-way share of second to do it. Four other Americans must win to make the squad for France. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Kevin Campbell once said of Arsenal "to actually play for the team I supported was a dream come true." Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757612_1_20240616004648.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Premier League striker Kevin Campbell has died aged 54, his former clubs Arsenal and Everton announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who died after a short illness, holds the record for most Premier League goals, 83, by a player never to win an international cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Arsenal Football is devastated to hear of the death of our much-loved former player Kevin Campbell," said Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell joined the Gunners as a schoolboy in 1985, making his first-team debut in 1988. He went on to play 228 times for Arsenal scoring 59 goals and winning a league title, an FA Cup, a European Cup Winners Cup and a League Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To actually play for the team I supported was a dream come true," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 164 games for Everton he scored 51 goals, including nine in five games which saved them from relegation in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Everton Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of the Club's most popular and much-loved former strikers, Kevin Campbell," they said on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who also played for Leicester, Leyton Orient, Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff, said one of his favourite memories in football was scoring the winner in the 2000 Merseyside derby, Everton's last victory at Anfield for 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was at the Kop End and my view, which will live with me until the day I die, is the Blues in the Kop going crazy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2001, manager Walter Smith made Campbell Everton's first black captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He made me the first black captain of Everton, which is something that I'm so proud of," Campbell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell moved to West Brom in January 2005 and was part of their "great escape," as they became the first club bottom of the Premier League at Christmas to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His son, Tyrese Campbell, is a striker who has just been released by Championship side Stoke City after seven seasons at the club. (AFP)

    Switzerland sink Hungary to make strong start at Euros

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland made a flying start at Euro 2024 as Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer scored their first international goals in a 3-1 win against Hungary on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murat Yakin's side raced into a two-goal lead by half-time in Cologne to kick off their Group A campaign in impressive fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah opened the scoring in only his second international appearance after making his debut earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-born 27-year-old, who plays for Bulgarian club Ludogorets Razgrad, holds dual citizenship with Ghana and Switzerland, who will be relieved he opted to represent them on the evidence of this dynamic display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After providing the assist for Duah's opener, Bologna midfielder Aebischer netted his maiden Switzerland goal with an eye-catching long-range strike just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barnabas Varga's seventh goal in nine starts for Hungary set up a tense finale, but Breel Embolo struck in stoppage-time to seal the points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following reports of a rift between Yakin and his players over tactics, Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka insisted on Friday that the air had been cleared in time for the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent dinner with Yakin featuring "plenty of wine" healed the wounds and the Bayer Leverkusen midfielder showed his support for the manager with an influential performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland beat France on penalties in the last 16 at Euro 2020 before losing a shoot-out to Spain in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will hope to emulate that memorable run after enjoying a perfect start in a group that also includes hosts Germany, who thrashed Scotland 5-1 in the tournament opener on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland face Scotland in their second game on Wednesday, while Hungary play Germany the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary boss Marco Rossi had urged his side to embrace the pressure of being ranked as one of Europe's emerging forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But their dismal first half proved fatal, showing that comparisons to Hungary's 'Mighty Magyars', who finished as runners-up at the 1954 World Cup, were rather premature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland needed just 12 minutes to puncture Hungarian optimism in ruthless fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aebischer slipped a perfectly weighted pass through the heart of the Hungary defence, sending Duah through to plant a clinical low finish past Peter Gulacsi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah's celebrations were initially curtailed by an erroneous offside flag, but the decision was corrected by the VAR as Switzerland's players mobbed their unheralded hero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruben Vargas should have sent the roiling red sea of Switzerland fans into ecstasy again moments later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vargas intercepted Milos Kerkez's wayward pass on the edge of the area, but the winger was left holding his head in frustration after his shot cannoned off Gulacsi's shoulder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss were on a roll and Willi Orban wasted a golden opportunity to halt their momentum with a close-range header that was straight at Yann Sommer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crucial moment as Aebischer doubled Switzerland's lead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Hungary sat too deep, a flowing Swiss move climaxed with Aebischer curling a superb strike into the far corner from 25 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga gave Hungary a lifeline in the 66th minute, just moments after he had missed a sitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominik Szoboszlai's pin-point cross found Varga and his diving header whistled past Sommer from six yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary pushed hard for an equaliser, but Embolo came off the bench to chip a cool finish over Gulacsi in the final seconds. (AFP)

    Ukraine summit seeking peace plan opens in Switzerland

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling the summit the first step towards a just peace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757607_1_20240615232721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders were joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Switzerland on Saturday for a summit on peace in his country, but with Russia staying away it is seen as the first step in a long process.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Swiss hosts have sought to temper expectations at the two-day gathering, with an agenda laying the groundwork for a path to peace – with future summits envisioned, eventually involving Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky himself expressed high hopes for the outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see history being made here at the summit," he said on social media platform Telegram, as he greeted presidents and prime ministers arriving at the luxury Burgenstock resort high above Lake Lucerne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we are making the first step toward just peace based on the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law," he said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a combative speech on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the conference and demanded that Kyiv effectively surrender before any actual peace negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky branded Putin's demands a territorial "ultimatum" reminiscent of Nazi Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler, while Nato and the United States also immediately rejected the hardline conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conference, convening exactly 100 countries and global institutions, comes at a perilous moment for exhausted Ukrainians and outgunned soldiers, more than two years since Moscow launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50 heads of state and government figure among the attendees, including all of the G7 leaders who have been meeting in Italy – with one notable exception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden instead sent his Vice President Kamala Harris, who announced more than US$1.5 billion in new aid for Ukraine, mainly for its energy sector and in humanitarian assistance as she arrived in a US Army helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are attending, as is the European Union chief and the leaders of Colombia, Chile, Finland, Ghana, Kenya and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentinian President Javier Milei and the presidents of Ecuador and Fiji were among the early arrivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Brics allies Brazil and South Africa are meanwhile only sending an envoy, and India will be represented at the ministerial level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is absent, insisting it will not take part without Moscow's presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost a year of stalemate, Ukraine was forced to abandon dozens of frontline settlements this spring, with Russian troops holding a significant advantage in manpower and resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near Ukraine's embattled eastern front, hopes for any major breakthrough are nearly nil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to hope that it will bring some changes in the future. But, as experience shows, nothing comes of it," said Maksym, a tank commander the Donetsk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Kyiv, Victoria, a 36-year-old energy industry worker, said she was "exhausted" by the war and wanted to believe the summit would help end it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, she said, "I'm a realist in life, so I don't have high hopes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts have also warned against unrealistic expectations from the gathering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meaningful negotiations that could truly end the devastating war in Ukraine remain out of reach, as both Kyiv and Moscow stick to theories of victory that amount to outlasting the other," the International Crisis Group think tank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit aims to find paths towards a lasting peace for Ukraine based on international law and the United Nations Charter; a possible framework to achieve this goal; and a roadmap as to how both parties could come together in a future peace process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A plenary session involving all delegations will be held on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three topics will be discussed in detail in working groups: nuclear safety, freedom of navigation and food security, and humanitarian aspects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second summit is envisaged. Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Tuesday that Kyiv hoped Russia would attend and receive a "joint plan" presented by the other attendees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the Rand think tank, said of the Burgenstock summit: "Russia is clearly going out of its way to demonstrate its pique with it... That tells you something.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Avoiding the expansion of the pro-Ukraine coalition – they're concerned about this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since mid-May, Russian military progress has slowed and Zelensky hopes to swing the momentum further with the back-to-back G7 and peace summits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky arrived at Burgenstock on Friday evening after the G7 summit agreed to offer a new US$50-billion loan for Ukraine, using profits from the interest on frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A landmark 10-year security deal signed by Zelensky and Biden on Thursday will see the United States provide Ukraine with military aid and training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, the European Union's 27 member states agreed "in principle" on beginning accession negotiations with Ukraine. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic dazzled and the Dallas Mavericks dominated Boston 122-84 on Friday to fend off elimination in the NBA Finals, denying the Celtics a sweep in the best-of-seven championship series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Doncic scored 29 points and Kyrie Irving added 21 for the Mavs, who snapped the Celtics' 10-game playoff winning streak but still have a mountain to climb as they try to become the first team to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win an NBA playoff series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now down 3-1, Dallas will try to stop the Celtics celebrating an 18th title when they travel to Boston for game five on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We knew we have to get it, we can't lose no more," Doncic said. "As we always say, we're going to believe until the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic, roundly criticised after game three when he fouled out with more than four minutes left and could only watch as the Mavs' comeback bid fell short, was dialled in on the defensive end as Dallas held the Celtics to 36.2 percent shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston star Jayson Tatum scored 15 points and Jaylen Brown had just 10 as the Mavs posted the third-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tim Hardaway Jr added 15 points off the bench for Dallas and 20-year-old rookie Dereck Lively added 11 – incuding his first career three-pointer – as the Mavs topped 100 points for the first time in the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas handed Boston their first road defeat of these playoffs and ended their bid for the 10th 4-0 sweep in Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Doncic and Irving leading the way, Dallas out-scored Boston 22-12 in the paint in the first quarter to build a 34-21 lead – the Mavs' highest-scoring quarter of the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no let-up in the second, the Mavs dominating every facet of the game on the way to a 61-35 halftime lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic scored 25 points in the first half, Irving had 11 and their supporting cast stepped up, too, Lively electrifying the crowd at American Airlines Center with his three-pointer, followed by an alley-oop dunk on the next possession in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think our energy was way higher," Doncic said. "Everybody was locked in defensive end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics, harried at every turn, made 14 of their 41 three-point attempts. They were out-scored 60-26 in the paint and out-rebounded 52-31 – Dallas' dominance on the boards leading to a 16-2 edge in second-chance points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown went to the bench with 2:11 left in the first half after picking up his third foul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic, meanwhile, answered critics with an intense effort on both ends of the floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stripped by Jrue Holiday on a drive to the basket Doncic dived for the loose ball and swatted it to Irving, who played it back to him for a layup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fouled on the play, Doncic made the free throw to put Dallas up 43-25 midway through the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavs were up 92-57 when Doncic and Irving checked out of the game to a standing ovation with 1:29 left in the third quarter, Irving offering Doncic a congratulatory embrace on the bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters late in the third, their attention already turning to game five and their next chance to break out of a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA titles. (AFP)

    Premier Li urges 'shelving differences' with Australia

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757599_1_20240615211810.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang called on Saturday for "shelving differences" with Australia as he launched a visit centred on the promise of economic opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li offered the olive branch after landing in Adelaide for a four-day diplomatic trip, which comes after China lifted trade sanctions against a string of major Australian exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History has proven that mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation are the valuable experience in growing China-Australia relations, and must be carried forward," he said in a written arrival statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A more mature, stable and fruitful comprehensive strategic partnership will be a treasure shared by the people of both countries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li touched down in Adelaide at the start of his diplomatic mission across the resource-rich continent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the highest ranking Chinese official to visit Australia since 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has gradually removed trade sanctions on wine, timber, barley and beef exports imposed in 2020 during a diplomatic rift with a former conservative government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The measures cost Australian exporters an estimated Aus$20 billion (US$13 billion) a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economic relations between the two countries have eased since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government took power in 2022 and adopted a softer diplomatic approach to Beijing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a case of suspected mad honey poisoning, after a 35-year-old man became dizzy and started vomiting about half an hour after eating the honey on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The following day he went to the accident and emergency department at Kwong Wah Hospital and was admitted with low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. He is in stable condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mad honey poisoning is caused by ingestion of honey containing grayanotoxins derived from plants belonging to the Ericaceae family - including rhododendrons, a CHP spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enquiries show the patient had consumed honey mailed to Hong Kong by a friend from Nepal. Investigations are ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first high-speed sleeper train from Hong Kong to Beijing departed on Saturday evening, with the transport minister calling the new overnight services a "breakthrough".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, also said the administration would look to see whether it was possible to increase the number of sleeper trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now we get four days of sleeper services. But it depends on how it goes. And I would say that if it is welcomed by the general public, we'll push for more," he told reporters prior to departure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The train for Beijing left at 6.24 pm on Saturday, and passengers will arrive at their destination about half a day later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy and excited that I can take the first train to Beijing. I haven't been to Beijing for a long while. I'll be able to see the bustle and the prosperity of our nation's capital," a lady surnamed Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This train is really good. It is fast. I only need to sleep one night and then I will arrive when I wake up. It saves a lot of time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service was among the travel agencies allotted tickets for the trip. Its managing director, Chen Rui-dong, said all of its 35 tickets were quickly snapped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following the chief executive's announcement, the tickets were sold out in half a day. We hope that there will be more sleeper train services in future," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sleeper train bound for Shanghai was set to depart from Hong Kong at 7.49 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new regular services, which will have trains running between Friday and Monday, trips from Hong Kong's West Kowloon terminus will take about 12.5 hours to get to Beijing, and around 11 hours to Shanghai.

    Heavy rain fails to dampen dragon boat race enthusiasm

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of spectators on Saturday flocked to the Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade to watch the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in spite of the heavy rain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 competitors, representing over 170 teams from 12 countries or regions, are taking part in the two-day sporting event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Singaporean rower said he was enjoying the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a new experience for us because we don't normally race out in the sea. I think in Singapore, we normally train in the reservoir, so the water is much calmer. I think it's a totally new experience for us," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's very great, very lively. I think we do not have such big international competitions back in Singapore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mainland tourist, Mr Shao, said the showers hadn't dampened the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The weather is cool. It is nice to have the dragon boat races here, whether it be from the spectators' or rowers' point of view. Probably because the race venue is close to the city centre, there are many tourists here. I think everyone can feel that Hong Kong is promoting Chinese traditional culture," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The races were organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong, China Dragon Boat Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fireworks display over Victoria Harbour scheduled for 8 pm was cancelled in light of the three Amber Rainstorm Warning Signals issued by the Observatory on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian attacks on southern Russia's Belgorod region killed six people on Friday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's Emergencies Ministry said four bodies had been pulled from the rubble of a multi-floor apartment building hit by Ukrainian shelling in the border town of Shebekino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A ministry statement posted after midnight said 50 percent of the rubble from the site had been cleared. Pictures on the ministry's Telegram channel showed a crane clearing debris and the building's facade shattered, with one stairwell collapsed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a Ukrainian drone had struck a car in a village near Shebekino, killing the driver. He said a woman was killed in her home when it was struck by rocket fire in the village of Oktyabrsky, further west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has staged frequent attacks on Belgorod and other Russian border regions in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Vladimir Putin cited attacks on Belgorod as grounds for a cross-border incursion last month into Ukraine's Kharkiv region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian military said its troops seized about a dozen settlements, while Ukrainian officials say the advance has been contained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the Ukrainian side of the border, military officials in Sumy region said a Russian air strike on Friday killed one person in the town of Shostka, about 45 km inside Ukrainian territory.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 edged lower on Friday, ending a four-day run of record closing highs, but gains in Adobe and other technology shares limited the decline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 technology sector rose, with Adobe shares jumping after the company raised its annual revenue forecast on more demand for its artificial intelligence-powered software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also digesting economic data to gauge how soon the Federal Reserve might be able to cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index slipped to 65.6 in June, sharply lower than expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Fed policymakers dialed back their projections for three cuts this year to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main situation here is we've got an extended market," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York. "You've had a big rally this week, led by big-cap tech. Under the surface, we have a lot of areas acting weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent, to end at 5,432, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.14 percent, to 17,688. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14 percent, to 38,591.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russell small-cap index fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said he was relieved after data this week showed inflation in May had cooled, but he would still like to see "more months" of similar data before cutting interest rates.

 Clinical Germany thumped Scotland 5-1 in their Euro 2024 tournament opener on Friday with the host nation scoring three first-half goals and enjoying a man advantage after Ryan Porteous received a straight red card before the break.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Florian Wirtz opened the scoring in the 10th minute when he connected with a cross that goalkeeper Angus Gunn could only palm against the post and watch helplessly as it rolled into the net during a match in which Germany dominated possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-times European champions doubled their lead in the 19th minute at the Munich Football Arena after a series of passes ended with Kai Havertz picking out Jamal Musiala who took a touch in the area and fired into the roof of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It went from bad to worse for Scotland when Porteous was sent off for a foul on Ilkay Gundogan in the penalty area with Havertz converting from the spot to make it 3-0. Substitute Niclas Fuellkrug fired home a fourth late in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland did get on the scoresheet late in the match through an Antonio Rudiger own goal before Emre Can rounded out the scoring for the hosts. Germany next play Hungary in Group A while Scotland must regroup to take on Switzerland. (Reuters)

    Singles not ruled out of LPH, says Winnie Ho

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing secretary Winnie Ho has played down suggestions that people who are single will be less likely to secure a Light Public Housing unit under a points system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Applications for the first batch of the modular temporary housing flats in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long begin on June 24. Only those who have been on the waiting list for public rental housing for at least three years can apply, and they will remain on the public housing list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the points system, families living in poor conditions, households with infants and the elderly, and people with disabilities would be given extra marks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, the minister said single-person households still have a chance for a light public housing unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entire social structure is centred on the family. Families take care of elderly people and children. They often have greater burdens and face situations which are more complex. So it's designed with families in mind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individuals, who are single, can still apply for light public housing because they can still qualify in certain circumstances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the majority of flats designed for one or two people, Ho said the provision of different home sizes was based on an earlier study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two people could already be considered to be a family. There are also households that have a single parent with a child. They are two people and that's a small family," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to results from a study on subdivided flats in 2021, around 70 percent are households with one or two people. Households of three, four or more accounted for 30 percent. So based on this ratio, and because our measure is aimed at taking care of people living in such conditions, the design is based on the actual situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With regard to the recent government clamp down on better-off people taking advantage of public housing, the minister said 14 tenants, who had failed to return a declaration form to authorities, would be told to vacate their units. They were among the first batch of 88,000 public housing tenants required to make declarations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And for a second group of 250,000 tenants told to make declarations, Ho said more than 90 percent had returned their forms, while officials had repossessed around 1,400 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Ho said a task force on subdivided units would submit a report in August after collecting views on the matter. She said some had suggested such flats should be a minimum of seven to 10 square metres in size.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government remains committed to large-scale developments despite challenges brought about by the geopolitical and economic situation, a top adviser for Chief Executive John Lee has said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Wong, who heads the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, also said the city's leader hoped the administration would work more closely with the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't underestimate the challenges... but also, on balance, we are very optimistic and we obviously have faith in the future, which is why the government is committed to large-scale developments, for example, in San Tin, a science and tech city, and the Northern Metropolis," Wong told RTHK's Your Home Address programme on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are big developments that are saying that we have faith in our future. We trust that the future will bring further development to Hong Kong. So I think as long as there's a capable government that works closely with society, with the efficient market, then we can bring opportunities to a very special place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Wong was appointed the head of the policy unit, which serves as a think-tank for the Chief Executive in formulating policies by conducting research and gathering opinions.

    Rebound in Chinese lending less than expected in May

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New lending by Chinese banks was not as strong as expected in May. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757494_1_20240614211921.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New bank lending in China rebounded far less than expected in May, and some key money gauges hit record lows, suggesting the world's second-largest economy continued to face headwinds even as the central bank seeks to bolster confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese banks issued 950 billion yuan in new loans last month, compared to 730 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters' calculations based on the latest data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted loans would rise to 1.255 trillion yuan but would still be below the 1.36 trillion yuan issued in May last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China’s credit extension came in lower than expected in May, suggesting that the deleveraging in the households continues," said Zhou Hao, chief economist at Guotai Junan International.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhou said China's central bank may be reluctant to cut interest rates any time soon, as that could lead to further depreciation of the yuan as the US Federal Reserve seems in no hurry to start cutting its rates, which is buoying the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Balancing all the factors, we think that the PBOC would refrain from policy rate cuts for now but provide more targeted support via relending programmes over the foreseeable future," he said. (Reuters)

    G7 says UNRWA must work unhindered in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 G7 leaders said the UN Palestinian refugee agency must be allowed to work unhindered in Gaza, in the draft of an end-of-summit statement seen by AFP on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We agree it is critical that UNRWA and other UN organisations and agencies' distribution networks be fully able to deliver aid to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandate effectively," the Group of Seven nations said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They called for all parties to facilitate "rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need" in Gaza, particularly women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Securing full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access in all its forms -- consistent with international humanitarian law, and through all relevant land crossing points, including the Rafah crossing, through maritime delivery routes, including through Ashdod Port -- and throughout all of Gaza remains an absolute priority," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UNRWA, which coordinates nearly all aid to Gaza, has been in crisis since January, when Israel accused about a dozen of its 13,000 Gaza employees of being involved in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That prompted many governments, including top donor the United States, to suspend funding to the agency, threatening its efforts to deliver aid in Gaza, although several have since resumed payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An independent review of UNRWA, led by French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some "neutrality-related issues" but said Israel had yet to provide evidence for its main allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the draft statement, the G7 leaders repeated concern at the "unacceptable number of civilian casualties" in the Hamas-Israel war, now into its ninth month. They again endorse a truce and hostage release deal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday expressed strong dissatisfaction and rejected criticism from the United States and  other Western countries over Hong Kong's decision to revoke the passports of six people accused of national security crimes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said in a statement that people who threaten national security often flee to other countries and continue to pose a threat to national security in various ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People who endanger national security often abscond overseas to avoid criminal liability and continue to endanger national security through various means, such as colluding with forces outside Hong Kong to put pressure on the central government and the Hong Kong government, or setting up organisations to endanger national security outside Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The measures taken against the fugitives are aimed at combating, deterring and preventing such conduct and facilitating their return to Hong Kong to face law enforcement and judicial proceedings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said that the United States and other Western countries have made false and irresponsible statements to confuse the public.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis on Friday called for a ban on "lethal autonomous weapons", as he addressed the G7 leaders' summit in Italy on the perils of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In light of the tragedy that is armed conflict, it is urgent to reconsider the development and use of devices like the so-called 'lethal autonomous weapons' and ultimately ban their use," the pope said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis became the first pontiff to address the G7 group of industrialised nations as he called on countries and global bodies to push for stronger guardrails on AI given the boom in artificial intelligence and its applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leaders of the Group of Seven nations turned their attention to migration at the start of the second day of their summit Friday, seeking ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to AI, the gathering in a luxury resort in Italy’s southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, as well as China’s industrial policy and economic security. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday said a woman is in critical condition in intensive care with botulism after receiving botox injections at a beauty clinic in Zhuhai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre said the 57-year-old woman, who was in good health, received the jabs between April 27 and May 15. About three days after the final shot, her speech became slurred and she had difficulty swallowing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CHP said she was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on May 22 but was discharged, against medical advice, the same day. The following day she was admitted again to Queen Mary after her symptoms worsened and then discharged two days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On June 2, she was admitted to intensive care at Tseung Kwan O Hospital due to a shortage of breath, choking, and limb weakness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre says Botox, or botulinum toxin, injections should only be prescribed and performed by registered doctors. It said the case had been reported to mainland authorities.

 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak warned on Friday that a vote for Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party would hand electoral victory to Labour, after a poll put the right-wing group ahead of Sunak's Conservatives for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Farage is one of Britain's most recognisable politicians best known for his decades long - and eventually successful - crusade for Britain to leave the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His Reform UK party began life as the Brexit Party in 2018, during the tortuous negotiations on how Britain would leave the bloc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage's unexpected return to frontline politics has split support among right-of-centre voters, badly damaging Sunak's hopes of winning an election he was already predicted to lose to the opposition Labour Party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That impact was shown in a YouGov poll on Thursday which put Reform UK on 19 percent, up from 17 percent previously, and the Conservative Party unchanged on 18 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, led by Keir Starmer, topped the poll with 37 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this poll was replicated it would hand a blank cheque to Labour," Sunak said in Italy, where he is attending the G7 summit, according to remarks reported by British media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately a vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate makes it more likely that Keir Starmer is in No.10."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage said his party had made a "phenomenal" start to the campaign and was now the real opposition to Starmer's Labour. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Friday said he's confident transport facilities would be able to cope with crowds heading to and from the Kai Tak Sports Park, as there will be various modes of transport to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An inter-departmental working group held its first meeting on Friday, and Chan said the main facilities of the park would be completed by the end of this year, and would open to the public in the first half of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main stadium of the park can accommodate up to 50,000 spectators, and Chan said transport facilities, including the nearby Sung Wong Toi and Kai Tak MTR stations, would be able to cater all of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there are large-scale events, we will increase the frequency of MTR trains to boost passenger capacity. We will also arrange taxis and buses. People can also walk further to other stations, like Choi Hung MTR Station. We are confident that order will be maintained," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that authorities were planning test runs ahead of the park's opening, and they would simulate a crowd of people leaving the park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about noise complaints after a recent music festival, Chan said the main stadium of the sports park has a retractable roof, and authorities would conduct noise assessments to ensure it meets proper standards.

    Tesla approves Musk's multi-billion dollar pay deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to restore CEO Elon Musk's record pay package. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757465_1_20240614175814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's US$56 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The favorable vote doesn’t necessarily mean that Musk will get the all-stock compensation anytime soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The package is likely to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months as Tesla tries to overturn the Delaware judge's rejection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker's stock remains richly valued even after several years of weakness in shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shareholders at Tesla's annual general meeting on Thursday re-approved Musk's 2018 record-setting compensation that backers said was necessary to keep the billionaire focused on the car company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk had raised doubts about his future with Tesla this year, writing on X, the social media platform he owns, that he wanted a 25 percent stake in the company in order to stop him from taking his artificial intelligence development projects elsewhere. The higher stake was needed to control the use of AI, he has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's stock rose nearly three percent on Thursday ahead of the meeting after Musk posted on X that he had won shareholder approval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even after Thursday's gains, Tesla's shares have tumbled 27 percent this year, and its market value has been more than halved to US$582 billion from its November 2021 high as Tesla faces fierce competition in China from BYD and other EV makers selling less-expensive cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's shares received a badly needed boost after Musk said on April 23 that Tesla would release more affordable new models in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its quarterly revenue fell for the first time since 2020, when the pandemic hampered production and deliveries. (Agencies)

    Time for Hong Kong to diversify portfolio: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong must not put all its eggs in one basket and should step up efforts to explore new market opportunities, according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister acknowledged that despite high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, the SAR's economy was on target to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent for the full year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau felt there was a need for businesses to diversify their investment portfolio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are seeing many opportunities around, especially in new economies in central Asia, central Europe, eastern Europe," he told reporters at a press event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed he was planning an upcoming duty visit to Peru in November, while there are plans to set up government outposts in Egypt and Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be helping the motherland for inviting investment from all those new economies using Hong Kong as a gateway into the mainland," Yau added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event to promote Hong Kong's industries, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said a sprawling technology park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop is going ahead full steam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed that the first three buildings within the park would be completed later this year, and authorities were still deciding how to carve out 87 hectares of space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The park will be developed in two phases - the western side will provide around one million square metres of office space for different sectors such as artificial intelligence," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will also be accommodation and ancillary facilities for professionals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The I&T minister had previously said that dozens of tech enterprises had expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics sectors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong stocks ended the week with another loss on Friday as data showing inflation slowing in the United States was offset by the Federal Reserve lowering its outlook for interest rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index lost 0.94 percent, or 170 points, to finish at 17,941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.12 percent to 3,032, while the Shenzhen Composite on China's second exchange slipped 0.37 percent, to finish six points lower. (AFP)

    GBA has edge over San Francisco in finance: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub has provided a "competitive advantage" to the Greater Bay Area in financial services over its counterpart in San Francisco, according to the financial chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One distinctive feature of the SAR, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a media interview, was the opportunity for companies to list on the city's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have Hong Kong, in the Greater Bay Area, being an international financial centre. We can marry both technological innovation and financial services to prosper. And this is the distinction between Hong Kong and San Francisco," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you want to develop and grow the innovation and technology sector, you need a lot of capital... But also you need to have an [international financial centre], a listing platform."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite that, Chan said there were similarities between the two bay areas in southern China and California, with the two being "economic powerhouses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign investment to the Greater Bay Area, the financial chief said the SAR remained attractive and competitive amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given this geopolitical tension, the capital market would be more volatile. Certain funding, say for example, funding from the US, may reduce their allocation to this part of the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in our engagement with the investing sector in the US, they are still very keen in the Greater Bay Area and the development of China, because they believe this is the growing future. And using the Greater Bay Area is not just for the Chinese market, but also for the Asia market as a whole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said local authorities were working hard to reach out to the international community and host mega events to clear up misunderstandings about the city, while also bringing about more than HK$10 billion into the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief also said the number of arrivals this year had risen thanks to the expansion of the solo travel scheme, allowing mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis instead of in tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combined with a rise in consumption, hopes of lower interest rates in the near future, and the resumption of international flights, Hong Kong's economy is estimated to grow between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's property prices, which plunged by almost a quarter from its historic high in September 2021 to February this year, Chan said it's normal for housing costs to adjust amid high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed out that both home prices and the number of transactions had risen after the government scrapped all property-cooling measures in February.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he believed there were many opportunities to explore in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Hong Kong could contribute with its unique strengths as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking with the media on the issue, Lee said Hong Kong would achieve greater benefits through cooperation with mainland counterparts in terms of technology and talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology integration is important. We contribute what we have been good at, such as research, such as high quality education, and then we combine that with the high quality research and talent in the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a strength of attracting both international talent, as well as mainland talent, and Hong Kong has been nurturing local talent. So Hong Kong has again the advantage of having the beauty of three areas, local, mainland and international. And that I think is a unique strength of Hong Kong in developing talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the city's future role as a financial hub amid growing concerns about geopolitical tensions between East and West, Lee expressed confidence in the investment and market sentiment despite the uncertainty and added risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wise investors look at markets in the long term. They know at the end, the market is always right. Politics doesn't affect the market in the long term. It will have an effect, but smart investors will find a way to absorb that political consideration and make very wise decisions based on economic development and economic opportunities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added he accomplished two important tasks in the two years since he took office, including enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and completing the District Council elections.

 Premier Li Qiang said on Friday that Beijing is willing to make efforts to upgrade the China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Addressing a welcome banquet in Auckland held by various social communities on day two of his visit to New Zealand, Li also said the momentum of China's economic recovery has continued to strengthen and consolidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier said the upgrading of China's economic structure will bring new opportunities for global development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will always be open to enterprises from New Zealand and other countries, Li added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier earlier visited the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research, a government agency tasked with promoting the country's farming, food and beverage industries, before meetings and a dinner with business people, academics and diplomats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mark Piper, the chief executive of a top New Zealand government science institute, was among those meeting Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was talking about more research collaborations and more people exchanges, which is what we're really interested in," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was really big on collaboration, the value that New Zealand can bring to China and that China can bring to New Zealand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li is due to travel to Australia on Saturday. He'll also visit Malaysia as part of his three-nation trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

    Millions gather in Mecca for Hajj pilgrimage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Muslim worshippers pray around the Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757438_1_20240614154349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 1.5 million pilgrims from around the world have amassed in and around Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage in which the faithful circle the cube-shaped Kaaba in the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of pilgrims was still growing as more from inside Saudi Arabia joined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities expected the number of pilgrims to exceed two million this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which pushed the entire Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran and its proxies on the other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinians in Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip’s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian authorities said 4,200 pilgrims from the occupied West Bank arrived in Mecca for Hajj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities said 1,000 more from the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the war in Gaza also arrived to perform Hajj at the invitation of King Salman of Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,000 invitees were already outside Gaza — mostly in Egypt — before closure of the Rafah crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, involves a series of rituals in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia that take several days to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the five pillars of Islam, it must be performed at least once by all Muslims who have the means to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After travelling from all parts of the globe to Islam's holiest city, the pilgrims will first perform the "tawaf" -- circling seven times around the Kaaba.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will then head towards Mina, a valley surrounded by craggy mountains several kilometres outside Mecca, where they will spend the night in air-conditioned tents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The climax will come on Saturday with day-long prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilgrims in white garments have already been circling the Kaaba in large numbers for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some have waited for years for the chance to make the trip, with permits allocated by Saudi authorities on a quota basis for each country. (Agencies)

    Cigarettes ban won't affect tourism: Lo Chung-mau

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Friday brushed aside lawmakers' concerns that banning vaping and flavoured cigarettes would make Hong Kong a less attractive destination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government last week put forward 10 measures to cut the number of smokers in the city, including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Starry Lee said Hong Kong would be less competitive when compared with other international financial centres which allow smoking, such as London, while retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the ban would discourage travellers from visiting Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lo said people did not come to Hong Kong just to smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most tourists who come to Hong Kong are non-smokers. Non-smokers always outnumber smokers. When they come to Hong Kong, they don't come to Hong Kong just to smoke. They come to Hong Kong to identify business opportunities. They want to experience our culinary experiences, tourism experiences, and so on,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So when we have a tobacco-free, vibrant, and healthy Hong Kong, it’s always better to have a city that is [free] of smoke.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers also raised concerns about the limitations in enforcement, with election committee sector lawmaker Chan Pui-leung saying there were staff shortages at the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office, and the definition of a queue was ambiguous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, catering sector lawmaker Tommy Cheung said the government should allocate more resources to educate the youth about the dangers of smoking, rather than solely focusing on banning cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister explained that creating a tobacco-free Hong Kong would require more than just enforcement efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In fact, it's not just about relying on law enforcement, but also about using certain enforcement measures to establish a culture, a norm, so that everyone will know in which areas smoking is prohibited. It can also be said that everyone is a smoking control ambassador.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.

    ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757423_1_20240614141154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC has arrested 20 people in connection with an alleged vehicle-testing scam.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body accused staff of a designated private testing centre of accepting advantages from garage proprietors or middlemen, and helping private cars that did not meet the required standards to pass the exhaust emission test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those arrested were staff of a designated testing centre, owners of three garages in the New Territories, middlemen as well as contract workers of the Transport Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten private cars were also seized in the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the Transport Department’s requirements, all private cars manufactured for over six years must undergo an annual examination at designated test centres in order to renew their vehicle licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The genuine fee for the examination is HK$585. What was happening was that the owners were paying a one-stop shop price for all the service. That was between HK$2,000 and HK$3,000,” said ICAC principal investigator David Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the difference between those two prices is the benefits that were made for both parties in either the garage owner would get business from the customers or the testing centre staff would be receiving some of that in bribery money.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams said staff at the testing centre substituted the results of cars that they knew would fail with those that had already passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said about 20 cars were referred by the garages to pass the examination fraudulently every month, and it's still trying to find out how long the syndicate has been in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Transport Department said it was very concerned about the incident and would cooperate with the ICAC in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said vehicle testing at the centre has been suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would strengthen the management and supervision of vehicle testing centres as advised by the ICAC.

    On World Blood Donor Day, fresh appeal for donations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Red Cross on Friday held a blood donation drive to mark World Blood Donor Day, with transfusion centres set up around town.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chief executive and medical director of the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Dr Lee Cheuk-kwong, called on the public to donate blood with inventory being low in the past few weeks due to weather, adding that blood has a limited shelf life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whenever there is rain, particularly heavy rain, people may just stay at home or go to shopping malls instead of going out to donations, so this is one of the limiting factors. Also, in rainy days, some companies may not be able to work with us in arranging the blood donation drive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Blood donations are still needed for many types of medical treatment and at the moment there's no replacement, so we need people to come out for donations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He especially called on people with blood types O and A to come forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the service has been targeting young people, especially university students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past few years after the pandemic, we have resumed some programmes in the young donors recruitment, in particular in the university," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Visiting schools remains one of our main objectives in our current recruitment strategies. Only the problem for us is fewer classes and students in the secondary schools, with those eligible mostly in form four, five and six."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The service collected a total of 210,103 units of blood in 2023, with just over 124,000 donors. Both figures were up from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the donation process is straightforward and rewarding, adding that each donation saves three lives.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757394_1_20240614120446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government has rejected an annual report on the SAR by the European Commission, saying it had "unfounded and biased content" on issues such as safeguarding national security and human rights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the administration also urged the European Union (EU) to stop interfering in the territory's affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability by slandering the city's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the commission outlined the political and economic developments in the SAR in 2023, pointing to the city's national security law and relevant court trials, as well as district council elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These developments undermine trust in the rule of law in Hong Kong and affect Hong Kong’s standing as an international business hub," said commission vice-president Josep Borrell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the report also noted "hopeful signs of progress on the rights of LGBTI+ people in Hong Kong, mainly carried forward by the judiciary", as well as substantial commercial links between the SAR and the EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration stressed that the city's national security laws were "precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also better safeguards the fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents of the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and other people, including those doing business, in the city," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU must immediately act reasonably and sensibly, and stop smearing the laws safeguarding national security in the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aleksander Barkov and Sergei Bobrovsky led the way as the Florida Panthers moved within a victory of their first Stanley Cup title, holding on to beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 in Game 3 of the final Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Game 4 is on Sunday morning, Hong Kong time. The Panthers have not won a championship since coming into the NHL in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barkov set up a goal and scored another, while Bobrovsky made 32 saves. Sam Reinhart, Sam Bennett and Vladimir Tarasenko also scored, with the Panthers pouncing on turnovers and quieting a fired up Edmonton crowd until the Oilers mounted a third-period rally that fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will take a comeback done just four times in league playoff history and once in the final – back in 1942 – to bring the Cup back to Canada. (AP)

    G7 leaders pledge support for Ukraine

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a 10-year security agreement on Thursday that they hailed as a milestone in relations between their countries, but that alone was not enough to stop Zelenskyy from wondering how much longer he could count on America's support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy also said his country “urgently” needed additional air defence systems to protect Ukrainians and the nation's infrastructure from Russia's continued bombardment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders signed the agreement on the sidelines of the annual Group of Seven summit, and Biden said the goal "is to strengthen Ukraine's defence and deterrence capabilities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference that the signing made for a “truly historic day,” but he also wondered about the durability of support from the United States and other allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's president said the right question to ask is “for how long the unity in the world will remain?" and how it will be influenced by the outcome of elections this year in many of those countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the first day of their meeting in southern Italy, G7 nations agreed on a deal to provide US$50 billion of loans for Ukraine backed by interest from frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although many details still need to be worked out, G7 members and the European Union are expected to contribute to the loan, with cash to reach Kyiv by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very historic step we're taking today," said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. "It is also a clear signal to the Russian President (Vladimir Putin), that he can't just sit this out and hope that fiscal problems in a country that backs Ukraine will one day let him win this war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  G7 leaders are also expected to discuss China and immigration in their summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pope Francis is also putting in a historic appearance at the G7 meeting, discussing artificial intelligence and holding multiple bilateral meetings including with Biden, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a historic day. We will welcome the Holy Father. It is the first time for a pontiff at a G7. I am proud it will happen under the Italian presidency," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told reporters on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests were staged near the summit venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators voiced support for Palestinians and accused the G7 of failing to do more in environmental protection. (AP/Reuters)
