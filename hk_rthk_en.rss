<div class="itemFullText">
 Atlanta Braves star outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. is out for the remainder of the season after suffering a complete tear of the ACL in his left knee on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acuna, the reigning National League MVP, injured the knee in the first inning of Sunday afternoon's 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates. Despite telling reporters that he did not think he tore the ligament, Acuna underwent an MRI exam and the Braves announced the results late Sunday night.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 26-year-old will undergo surgery at a later date, the team said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acuna led off Sunday's game with a double to right-center field off Pirates left-hander Martin Perez. He made a move toward third base with Marcell Ozuna batting and fell awkwardly to the ground.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He remained on the ground for several minutes before slowly limping off the field. Jarred Kelenic replaced Acuna in the Atlanta lineup.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I saw the catcher throwing the ball back to the pitcher very slow," Acuna said through an interpreter. "I was timing that so I could steal third. But in that moment, he threw it hard. So I had to come back, and that's when I felt it."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Braves manager Brian Snitker called Acuna's injury "very concerning" before the results of his testing came in.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acuna tore the ACL in his right knee on July 10, 2021, and returned 9 1/2 months later early in the 2022 season. He also sprained his left ACL in May 2018 and was sidelined for just more than a month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acuna finishes his abbreviated seventh MLB season with a .250 batting average, four home runs and 15 RBIs in 49 games.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The first player in MLB history to accomplish a 40-home run, 70-steal season, Acuna is a career .289 hitter with 165 homers and 417 RBIs in 722 games. He's a four-time All-Star and was the unanimous NL MVP in 2023. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 66 points and Dallas surged home in a 116-107 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday that gave the Mavericks a 3-0 stranglehold on their NBA Western Conference final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The latest thriller in the series, this time in Dallas, came after the Mavs won games one and two in Minneapolis by a total of four points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a fourth quarter that saw the teams trade the lead seven times, the star Mavs duo spearheaded a closing 12-3 scoring run.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Mavericks will have their first chance to clinch the series when they host game four on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 No team has rallied from 3-0 down to win an NBA playoff series.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Doncic and Irving each finished with 33 points, Doncic adding seven rebounds and five assists and Irving producing 14 of his points in the fourth quarter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 P.J. Washington scored 16 points, draining a three-pointer that put Dallas up for good, 107-104, with 3:38 to play.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daniel Gafford blocked three shots for Dallas, including a monster rejection on Mike Conley in the final minute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 26 points, but had just four in the fourth quarter. Anthony Edwards missed all four of his attempts in the fourth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A bruising contest saw the Mavericks lose Dereck Lively early in the second quarter after the rookie reserve took a knee to the back of the head from a leaping Karl-Anthony Towns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The frightening moment brought Mavs coach Jason Kidd out to check on Lively, who had already taken a painful knee to the groin from Towns trying to guard him under the basket. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group rallied as much as 95 percent on Monday morning after the firm resumed trading following a share transfer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company, which is the EV unit of embattled property developer China Evergrande, on Sunday said 29 percent of its shares, or 3.14 billion, were expected to immediately change hands after liquidators reached a preliminary agreement with an unidentified buyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The deal, subject to due diligence, includes an option for the buyer to take an additional 29.5 percent of the shares, or about 3.2 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The market value of the total shares involved is about HK$2.41 billion, based on the HK$0.38 per share before the trading suspension on May 17.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agreement, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday, also includes a possible credit line to be arranged by the buyer to finance the company’s ongoing operations and the development of its electric vehicle businesses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares of the EV unit rallied to HK$0.74 per share shortly after its trading resumption.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EV maker is faced with a severe shortage of capital, with its Tianjin factory having ceased production at the beginning of the year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It has been struggling since its parent firm got sucked into a property crisis in China in 2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trading in the shares of Evergrande remains suspended.

    Divided views on future of waste charging scheme

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There are divided views on the way forward for a citywide waste charging scheme. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754835_1_20240527112150.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opinion remained split on the best way forward for a citywide waste charging scheme, with some lawmakers urging authorities to shelve the plan and green groups calling for a timeline.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sources said the government would shelve the pay-as-you-throw scheme scheduled to take effect from August 1, with lawmakers expected to discuss its fate during a Legco panel meeting on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told an RTHK programme that it was "irresponsible" to put the plan on the back-burner.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We believe this won't help solve the waste problem in Hong Kong. Government departments should take the lead in implementing the waste charging scheme," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Why not do it in phases first, instead of ignoring the issue and pretending that nothing's happened? This will waste a bill that's been on hold for 20 years, and Hong Kong will lose its chance to reduce waste."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But a legislator and industry representatives told an RTHK programme that they welcome the move because the city was simply not ready for the plan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's more appropriate to shelve [the scheme] indefinitely. We should look at it practically. We've come up with a date before, but it didn't happen because the conditions were not met," said DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lau added putting the plan on hold doesn't mean a stop in waste recycling and education work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Simon Wong who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that the catering industry was concerned about manpower shortages and rising operating costs if the scheme went as planned.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Five concern groups - including Civic Exchange, Green Power, Greenpeace, The Green Earth, and Greeners Action - wrote to the chief executive and asked for no more delay in the implementation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's star swimmer Siobhan Haughey snapped up three gold medals in the first leg of the Mare Nostrum Swim Tour in France.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Olympic medallist won her first gold on day one in the 100m breaststroke in the town of Canet-en-Roussillon, where she finished with a time of 1 minute, 7.01 seconds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Haughey then captured her second gold of the session with a stunning time of 1 minute, 55.39 seconds in the women's 200m freestyle, ultimately beating the pack by over three seconds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On day two, she sealed her third gold medal, in the 100m freestyle event in 52.55 seconds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR's Ian Ho, who like Haughey has qualified for the Paris Olympics this summer, won bronze in the men's 50m freestyle event with a time of 22.38 seconds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was only .01 seconds behind the silver medallist, Dylan Carter of Trinidad and Tobago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The next leg of the tour is due to take place from May 29 to May 30 in Barcelona.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Profits of China's major industrial firms increased 4.3 percent year on year in the first four months of the year, official data showed on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The growth rate was the same with that registered in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For April alone, profits were up 4 percent, versus a 3.5 percent slide in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Industrial firms with an annual main business revenue of at least 20 million yuan saw their combined profits reach 2.09 trillion yuan during the January-April period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The pickup in earnings followed export-led growth in factory output over the past month while retail sales unexpectedly slowed, underscoring uneven recovery.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Domestic effective demand remains insufficient while the external environment is still complicated and severe," said NBS statistician Wei Ning in a separate statement, noting that the foundation for improvement in industrial profits needs to be consolidated. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia will visit China this week, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The leaders will from May 28 to June 1 "pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among the delegation will be Bahrain's King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China continues its role a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and President Xi Jinping has called for an "international peace conference" to resolve the fighting. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are investigating the death on Sunday of a cyclist in a village near Tai Po who apparently lost control of her bicycle while riding downhill.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 30-year-old woman was riding down Tai Mei Tuk Road towards Tai Mei Tuk town centre at around 7pm when she rammed into a drop barrier.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was taken unconscious to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in Tai Po, where she was declared dead about an hour after the crash.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The New Territories North special traffic investigations team is looking into the case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tai Mei Tuk is a popular destination for cyclists and hikers, located on the edge of the Plover Clove reservoir and country park.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, officers in Kowloon West are continuing to look into the deaths of a motorcycle rider and his passenger in Mong Kok in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 22-year-old motorcyclist and a 24-year-old woman were on a motorbike that collided with a taxi at the junction of Argyle Street and Nathan Road.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The taxi driver, 27, suffered limb injuries along with his 38-year-old passenger. A 69-year-old man who was walking past the scene suffered facial injuries from flying fragments in the crash. All three men required hospital treatment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tornado-spawning storms swept across parts of the central United States, killing at least a dozen people and leaving a trail of destruction as forecasters warned of more severe weather over the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At least seven people, including children, were killed in Texas when a powerful tornado struck communities in the north central part of the state near the Oklahoma border on Saturday night, Ray Sappington, the sheriff of Cooke County, said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Two children, aged two and five, were among the victims, Sappington said. Numerous injuries were reported, Cooke County officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As the scale of the disaster came into full view on Sunday, officials were wrapping up search and rescue operations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The sheriff said some of the many trailer homes in the hardest-hit area were "completely gone" and others had suffered massive damage from the storm which Sappington estimated left a quarter-mile wide path of destruction for three to four miles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A tornado also crossed into Denton County, northwest of Dallas, on Saturday night, damaging homes and other property, and knocking down power lines. Officials said that "a number of individuals" with injuries were transported to area hospitals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hundreds of thousands of customers were without power across a large swath of the country, including in Arkansas, Missouri and Texas on Sunday, according to poweroutages.us.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials in Arkansas also reported several storm-related fatalities, including one in Benton County, two in Marion County and a 73-year-old woman in Baxter county. Responding authorities described roads closed and clogged with debris, downed trees and power lines, homes and businesses destroyed, as well as numerous injuries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Storms caused widespread damage and at least two fatalities in parts of Oklahoma, where officials activated an Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate efforts statewide.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Indiana, adverse weather delayed the start of the famed Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, or Indy 500, car race.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The latest bout of extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through a rural Iowa town, killing four people. (Reuters)

 North Korea has notified Japan of its plan to launch a rocket carrying a space satellite towards the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and shared a view that North Korea's satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would be in violation of UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The officials agreed to demand North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an emailed release. (Reuters)

    Saints alive! Southampton sink Leeds for EPL return

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton won promotion back to the Premier League by beating Leeds United 1-0 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, earning an immediate return to England’s top tier in a game considered the richest in world football.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Adam Armstrong was the match-winner as his first-half goal was enough to see off a Leeds side that struggled to muster a meaningful response, with substitute Daniel James coming closest when his shot hit the bar late in the second half.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Southampton join Championship winners Leicester City and runners-up Ipswich Town in the Premier League next season, the latter promoted after a 22-year absence from the top flight, while the Foxes, like Saints, went up at the first attempt.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Southampton got the decisive goal after 24 minutes when Armstrong latched onto a through ball by Will Smallbone and slid it past keeper Illan Meslier for his 24th goal of the season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Promotion means Saints are set to receive a windfall of at least US$178 million, according to analysis from Deloitte’s Sports Business Group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The rewards on offer resulted in a cagey affair with a lack of clear chances and Southampton would have been pleased to see Leeds substitute Italy winger Wilfried Gnonto and Championship Player of the Year Crysencio Summerville in the second half.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nine minutes of stoppage time gave Daniel Farke's trailing Yorkshire side hope and they huffed and puffed but failed to break down the excellent Saints defence. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc celebrated a boyhood dream come true on Sunday as the first home winner of Formula One's showcase Monaco Grand Prix since Louis Chiron triumphed in 1931.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was also the first time the 26-year-old had stood on the Monaco podium in six attempts and came after two standing starts from pole position in a race halted when first-lap collisions took out a fifth of the field.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished runner-up, 7.1 seconds behind after 78 laps without a chance to overtake on a street circuit that often produces processional races, and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was third.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It means a lot," said Leclerc, who screamed over the radio as he took a chequered flag waved by France soccer forward Kylian Mbappe while the crowd erupted and Prince Albert gave a royal thumbs up.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's the race that made me dream of becoming a Formula One driver one day."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Red Bull's championship leader and 2023 Monaco winner Max Verstappen started and finished sixth, the third time in eight races this season that the triple world champion has been beaten.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 McLaren's Lando Norris was fourth and George Russell fifth for Mercedes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with a bonus point for fastest lap, and Yuki Tsunoda eighth for Red Bull-owned RB.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alex Albon scored Williams's first points of the season in ninth and Pierre Gasly took the final one for Alpine despite a first-lap collision with team mate Esteban Ocon, whose race ended immediately. (Reuters)

    Major cyclone hits Bangaldesh as almost a million flee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People gather their belongings to head inland in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754785_1_20240526235020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An intense cyclone smashed into the low-lying coast of Bangladesh on Sunday, with nearly a million people fleeing inland for concrete storm shelters away from howling gales and crashing waves.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The severe Cyclone Remal has started crossing the Bangladesh coast," Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Azizur Rahman said, adding the raging storm could continue hammering the coast until at least the early hours of Monday morning.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have so far recorded maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometres per hour, but the wind speed may pick up more pace."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Forecasters predicted gusts of up to 130 kilometres per hour, with heavy rain and winds also lashing neighbouring India.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its densely populated coast has increased sharply, from one a year to as many as three, due to the impact of climate change.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to four metres above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous," Bangladeshi senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are terrified," said 35-year-old fisherman Yusuf Fakir at Kuakata, a town on the very southern tip of Bangladesh in the predicted route of the storm, speaking just before its arrival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At least 800,000 Bangladeshis fled their coastal villages, while more than 50,000 people in India also moved inland from the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea, government ministers and disaster officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We want to ensure that a single life is not lost," said Bankim Chandra Hazra, a senior minister in India's West Bengal state.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 India's Kolkata airport closed on Sunday, while the Indian navy readied two ships with aid and medical supplies for "immediate deployment". (AFP)

    30 killed in strike on Rafah; Hamas targets Tel Aviv

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli air strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded dozens in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah designated for the displaced, Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials said on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The strike took place in Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah, where thousands of people were taking shelter after many fled the eastern areas of the city where Israeli forces began a ground offensive over two weeks ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Palestinian health official said dozens of Palestinians were killed and wounded while Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, put the number of deaths at 30.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah was receiving an influx of casualties, and that other hospitals also were taking in a large number of patients.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There was no immediate comment from Israel. The final death toll was unclear as many wounded were in critical condition, medics said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the attack in Rafah as a "massacre", holding the United States responsible for aiding Israel with weapons and money.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The air strikes burnt the tents, the tents are melting and the people's bodies are also melting," said one of the residents who arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said eight projectiles were identified crossing from the area of Rafah, the southern tip of the Gaza Strip where Israel kept up operations despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop attacking the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A number of the projectiles were intercepted, it said. There were no reports of casualties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his war cabinet later on Sunday to discuss continued operations in Rafah. Israel argues that the UN court's ruling allows room for some military action there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Hamas al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets were launched in response to "Zionist massacres against civilians". (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 670 people are assumed to have died in Papua New Guinea's massive landslide, the UN migration agency estimated on Sunday as rescue efforts continued.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Media in the nation had previously estimated Friday's landslide had buried more than 300 people. But more than 48 hours later the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said the death toll may be more than double that, as the full extent of the destruction is still unclear and continuing dangerous conditions on the ground are hampering aid and rescue efforts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Only five bodies had been retrieved from the rubble so far.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agency based its death toll estimates on information provided by officials at Yambali Village in the Enga province, who say more than 150 houses were buried in Friday's landslide, Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the agency's mission in Papua New Guinea said in an email statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Land is still sliding, rocks are falling, ground soil is cracking due to constant increased pressure and ground water is running thus the area is posing an extreme risk for everyone," Aktoprak said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 250 houses nearby have been abandoned by the inhabitants, who had taken temporary shelter with their relatives and friends, and some 1,250 people have been displaced, the agency said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "People are using digging sticks, spades, large agricultural forks to remove the bodies buried under the soil," Aktoprak said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The IOM said an elementary school, small businesses and stalls, a guesthouse, and a petrol station were also buried.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The UN's Papua New Guinea office said five bodies were retrieved from an area where 50 to 60 homes had been destroyed, and a number of injured reported, including at least 20 women and children.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 IOM said the community in this village was relatively young and it's feared that the most fatalities would be children of 15 years or younger.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The geographic remoteness and the tough, hilly terrain is slowing rescue and aid efforts. (Reuters)

 An alliance of six NGOs supporting street sleepers on Sunday called on Hongkongers to show more compassion for the homeless.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Homeless Alliance said there is less negativity shown towards street sleepers nowadays, but there is still room for the public to better understand their plight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The alliance held a fair on Sunday and invited people to sit in a demonstration set-up of cardboards and umbrellas to experience homelessness.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There were also sharing sessions where current and former street sleepers shared their life stories.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A former homeless person, Siu-hing, said she was happy to tell people about herself.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I hope people will not look at homeless people with prejudice," she told RTHK. "I've had it rough."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chi-keung, who said he was a big spender before becoming homeless, said he hopes people can learn from his experience.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "People who become homeless all have their stories, I'm sharing mine so people will be alert," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Isaac Ho, who works for ImpactHK – one of the six NGOs in the alliance – said fair participants can also learn how to communicate with the underprivileged.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Don't miss the self-introduction when you approach them, let them know you're here as a human being to care for another human being," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He urged the government to devise policies to support those who’re homeless, including having a longer notice period before cleaning the streets, and arranging housing for them in the long run.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If we want to tackle [homelessness], we give them a home to live first. And then medical, social counseling, employment services can also be delivered to them. Sleeping in a more stable and safe environment is the foundation of change."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said officials have stepped up inspections of old buildings following a deadly blaze at a residential building in Jordan last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On April 10, a No.3 alarm fire which broke out in New Lucky House killed five people and injured around 40 others.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a TVB programme, Yeung said preliminary investigation showed that some of the fire doors were open, which might have led to heavy smoke in one of the staircases.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yeung said the Fire Services Department has since improved its inspection mechanism, with priority being given to old buildings and those for commercial use.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We use a risk-based inspection mechanism which decides how often a building should be checked each year based on how risky it is,” he explained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “After the fire in New Lucky House, we adjusted the mechanism to prioritise inspections of old buildings and commercial premises, hoping to eliminate fire hazards as soon as possible.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yeung said 2,000 inspections had been carried out and around 600 fire hazard abatement notices had been issued in the past month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The fire services director also noted that an amendment bill will be tabled to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.

    Govt to shelve waste charging scheme: sources

    <![CDATA[<img alt="DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan says he believes the government will continue to step up promotional efforts on waste reduction to boost the community’s understanding of the matter. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754752_1_20240526154606.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say the government will shelve its plan to introduce a citywide waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The arrangement was originally scheduled to come into effect from August 1, but sources say the government will inform the Legislative Council on Monday of its plan to put it on the back-burner indefinitely.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who's also chairman of Legco's Panel on Environmental Affairs, welcomed the news, saying this is not the right time to introduce the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said officials should consider a number of factors, such as the state of the city's economy and the availability of recycling services, before deciding when to bring back the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lau added that he believes the government will continue to step up education and promotional efforts on waste reduction to boost the community’s understanding of the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said he would be "very disappointed" if the scheme is to be shelved indefinitely.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said Hong Kong is facing a very serious waste crisis, and called on lawmakers not to overexaggerate the scheme's impact on the community.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Please do not blow up part of the community's negative response or comment. The effects of the financial burden mentioned by some of the political parties only affect some of the sectors of the community," he told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The government has already delayed the waste charging scheme twice in the past... the authorities should treat this law seriously and give the public the timeline for rolling out the scheme."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a trilateral summit with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. It's their first three-way talks in more than four years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries agreed to hold a summit every year starting in 2008 to boost regional cooperation, but the initiative has been disrupted by tensions and the Covid-19 pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Their last trilateral summit was in late 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials in Seoul said South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Li will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the ageing population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with Li and Kishida ahead of their three-way gathering on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kishida is also expected to meet separately with Li.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials and diplomats in Seoul warned not to expect breakthroughs on sensitive issues but said the summit could make progress in areas of practical cooperation like people-to-people exchanges and consular matters. (Reuters)

    Trump vows to free 'dark web' drug kingpin

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of US presidential candidate Donald Trump spar with opponents during the Libertarian Party's national convention in Washington. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754743_1_20240526140121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump appealed for support from the fringe Libertarian Party on Saturday, telling a rowdy crowd that if elected he would free from prison an American man who ran a website that sold millions of dollars in drugs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The announcement came at a contentious speech -- where the crowd often jeered and booed the ex-president -- at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, as he seeks support in the November US election against incumbent Joe Biden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If you vote for me, on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht," Trump said, in a line that brought the rowdy crowd over to his side as cheers erupted from the audience.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also vowed to put a libertarian in his cabinet.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2015, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of masterminding the Silk Road "dark web" marketplace, which sold US$200 million in drugs to customers across the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ulbricht, who ran Silk Road under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" and was also accused of commissioning five murders at a cost of US$650,000, was sentenced to two life sentences for narcotics distribution and criminal enterprise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His case has become a famous cause in libertarian circles, who have decried the conviction as government overreach and against the principles of free markets.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump has previously vowed to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While the promise to free Ulbricht brought cheers, Trump's speech was far from the usual lovefest he presides over at his rallies, which typically attract hardcore supporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The conservative was variously booed as he tried to make common cause with the libertarians in the audience, many of whom view his policies as outside their extremely limited scope of what the government should be able to do.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Libertarian Party should nominate Trump for president of the United States," he said to a mix of cheers and boos.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Only if you want to win. Maybe you don't want to win," Trump said as he at times sparred with the audience.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The speech came after Trump rolled the dice on Thursday by making a campaign stop in deeply Democratic New York, seeking to woo Black and Latino voters whose support for Biden has shown signs of faltering.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If you want to compete for untraditional votes, you have to take risks," Trump advisor Jason Miller told news outlet Semafor.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Libertarian Party routinely runs minor candidates that promote both popular limited-government ideas like marijuana legalization while simultaneously pushing fringe ideas like abolishing the federal tax collection agency or social security.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its candidates have never posed serious threats in presidential elections.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If they weren't interested in mixing it up by endorsing Trump, they were free to "keep getting your three percent every four years," he said. (AFP)

    Golf world rocked by death of Grayson Murray

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfer Grayson Murray, who won his second PGA Tour title at the Sony Open in January, died on Saturday at the age of 30, the tour said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray had withdrawn from the Charles Schwab Challenge with an unspecified illness during Friday's second round in Texas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We were devastated to learn - and are heartbroken to share - that PGA Tour player Grayson Murray passed away this morning. I am at a loss for words," PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The PGA Tour is a family, and when you lose a member of your family, you are never the same. We mourn Grayson and pray for comfort for his loved ones."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monahan said he had spoken with Murray's parents to offer condolences and they had "asked that we continue with tournament play.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They were adamant that Grayson would want us to do so. As difficult as it will be, we want to respect their wishes."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Tour did not specify a cause of death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray's second career title in Hawaii in January was an emotional affair, capping a stunning personal comeback from alcohol abuse and mental health issues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray, who had claimed his only prior tour title as a rookie at the 2017 Barbasol Championship, had also been slowed by a motor scooter accident in Bermuda in 2022.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After rolling in a 38-foot birdie putt to win a three-man playoff, Murray said he hoped his return to the winner's circle could provide inspiration for others.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If I can help one person that's all it takes," he said in Hawaii.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's not easy," Murray mused.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I wanted to give up a lot of times -- give up on myself, give up on the game of golf, give up on life at times," he said, adding that he hoped his legacy going forward would be to be "known as a good person."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray had been tabbed for stardom from a young age.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was just 16 when he made his first cut on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour and won three straight Junior World Championships from 2006-08.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A solid season on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2023 saw him return to the PGA Tour, and his Sony Open victory saw him reach a career high 46th in the world rankings. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico City, which is in the midst of a heatwave, recorded its highest-ever temperature on Saturday as thermostats hit 34.7 degrees Celsius, according to the National Meteorological Service (SMN).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The record high was recorded on Saturday afternoon at the Tacubaya observatory, the SMN said, after thermometers in the capital reached an earlier record of 34.3 degrees Celsius on May 9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico warned on Wednesday that in the next two weeks intensifying heat could bring new record temperatures to the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The country has recorded 48 deaths due to intense heatwaves hitting the country since March, the government said on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The eastern coastal state of Veracruz recorded the highest number of deaths, with 14, followed by Tabasco, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas with eight each.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, Mexico reported a record 419 heat-related deaths in the hot season, which runs from March to October, in a country of 129 million people. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of a community project to support carers on Sunday said nine carer spaces will be set up across the city to identify caregivers and address their plight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Patrick Nip, convenor of the Advisory Committee of the Jockey Club Carer Space Project, said Hong Kong’s ageing population is a growing cause for concern.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nip noted that some 240,000 people are providing long-term care for around 300,000 elderly citizens in the community.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a radio programme, Nip said it's important to remind carers to take care of their own mental health.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "How can we strengthen support for carers and remind them that they have their own needs too? Some don't see themselves as carers because they think it's their duty. Others might not be aware of their own mental state - even when they're on the verge of collapse. So I think an assessment is needed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The carer spaces, located in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Ma On Shan, Kwai Fong, Tsing Yi, Tai Wai, Shek Kip Mei, Sai Wan Ho and Sham Shui Po, will provide counselling and assessment services for carers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daytime respite services for the elderly will also be available at a cost of HK$30 for four hours, with exemptions for those facing financial difficulties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nip, a former government official, said the five-year project is expected to benefit around 27,000 carers and 15,000 care recipients.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the ultimate goal is to create a viable model for the administration to consider going forward.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Most importantly, we hope to innovate boldly and try to find a feasible model in this pilot project. It can be replicated on a large scale, so the government can take over and it can be sustained. This is our goal," he explained.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said talks he held during his trip to Paris showed that these visits were conducive to helping others better understand the SAR's development, and clearing up misunderstandings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing on his official blog, the minister said he had been promoting the SAR's advantages to political and business leaders in France, and they were highly interested in the city’s latest developments.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some meeting participants told us that it was very important for the SAR government to actively go out and contact friends from different sectors," he wrote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The financial chief said people he met during his French visit agreed that the SAR remains highly promising, with some describing the city as being as vibrant and charismatic as it was before the pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan added that he had been fostering exchanges between the two places in the business and cultural arenas, noting that he invited the organiser of a French tech conference, VivaTech, as well as the Théâtre National de Chaillot, to come to Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said he will be leaving for San Francisco on Monday to promote cooperation between China and the United States in dealing with climate change.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Although the current geopolitical situation is complicated, addressing climate change is the responsibility of the whole world. Countries must establish a stronger foundation for cooperation and smoother communication channels, so that the world can have a greater chance of success in moving towards zero carbon."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan said Hong Kong is sparing no efforts in becoming an international hub of green technology and finance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He noted that he and other representatives will be sharing the SAR's knowledge and experience in developing a sustainable future in the Bay to Bay Dialogue and the US-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action.

 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung has congratulated Hong Kong rowing athlete Chiu Hin-chun on winning a gold medal in Lightweight Men's Single Sculls in the 2024 World Rowing Cup II Lucerne, Switzerland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 29-year-old led the 2,000-metre race all the way and finished it in just over 7 minutes. Coming in second was Baptiste Savaete from France.

 "Chiu Hin-chun reaped a gold medal with his outstanding performance in the competition. He also wrote a new page in Hong Kong’s rowing history for being the first Hong Kong rowing athlete to gain a gold medal at an international competition,” Yeung said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are proud of his striving spirit.”

    US rapper Nicki Minaj freed after Netherlands arrest

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans celebrate Nicky Minaj's release from custody in Amsterdam. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754715_1_20240526064212.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Nicki Minaj was detained at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on suspicion of possessing soft drugs before being released with a fine, Dutch media reported on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The singer was due to perform a show in Britain later on Saturday and posted images on social media of her being questioned by officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police confirmed that they had detained a 41-year-old American woman but declined to confirm directly that it was Minaj, as per their usual policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We never confirm the identity of a person in custody but I can confirm we have arrested a 41-year-old woman suspected of trying to export soft drugs to another country," said Robert Kapel, a military police spokesman.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kapel later said the suspect had been released after the payment of a "reasonable" fine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's no reason for us to keep her in custody any longer. We have all the information for our file. Case closed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The rapper posted on X that authorities told her they had found cannabis in her luggage, which she said belonged to her security personnel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Keep in mind they took my bags without consent. My security has already advised them those pre-rolls belong to him," she wrote on X, referring to marijuana joints.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Now they said I have to go five mins away to make a statement about my security to the police precinct," she said. "It's to try to make me late so that they can write negative stories."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her concert in Manchester scheduled for Saturday night had to be postponed. Promoter Live Nation said the performance will be rescheduled and tickets will be honoured.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A common misconception outside the Netherlands is that dope is legal in the country, home to world-famous coffee shops (which actually sell pot) that are a huge draw for cannabis smokers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The consumption of small quantities of cannabis is technically illegal but police choose not to enforce the law as part of a "tolerance" policy in place since the 1970s.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Transporting the drugs to another country is illegal. (AFP/AP)

    Celtic beat Rangers to complete double

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Adam Idah scored a 90th-minute winner as Celtic beat Glasgow rivals Rangers 1-0 on Saturday to lift the Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A scrappy game was decided by an error as Jack Butland fumbled Paulo Bernardo's effort and Idah pounced for his ninth goal of a loan spell from Norwich.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I said I'd come here to try and score as many goals as I could, I didn't think I'd score a goal like this in front of all these fans. It's an amazing feeling," said Idah, who only made the move to Glasgow in January.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's hard to put into words. Anyone here can see what it means to the fans, to the players. I've always supported Celtic, it's amazing!"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rangers thought they had taken the lead earlier in the second half when Abdallah Sima turned home a corner at the far post.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But after a VAR review, Celtic goalkeeper Joe Hart was handed a reprieve in the final match of his career as the former England international had been pushed by Nico Raskin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Celtic were far from their best but maintained their unbeaten record in five meetings against Rangers this season, which has also secured them direct qualification for next season's Champions League by winning the Scottish Premiership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Victory also continued Brendan Rodgers' remarkable Scottish Cup record across two spells in charge of the Hoops.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rodgers has never lost a Scottish Cup tie in 17 matches and takes his trophy haul as a Celtic boss to nine in three-and-a-half seasons.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Celtic's win also has historical significance as they move level with Rangers' total of 118 trophies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The head-to-head between the clubs is also now level after 441 meetings with 169 wins each and 103 draws. (AFP)

    Russian strikes on Kharkiv DIY store kill 4 people

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Saturday bombed a hardware superstore in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, killing at least four people and wounding 38, Ukraine officials said, in an attack condemned as "vile" by President Volodymyr Zelensky.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov said "unfortunately there are already four dead" and "38 wounded" after two guided Russian bombs hit the store.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Two of those killed "were men who worked in the hypermarket," Synegubov said earlier in a video posted on Telegram.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thick black smoke billowed from the gutted building of the Epitsentr DIY superstore in the northeastern outskirts of the city, as firefighters sprayed water on a blaze sparked by the strikes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Still wearing her uniform, Lyubov, a cleaner at the hypermarket told how she escaped the building.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It happened all of a sudden. We didn't understand at first, everything went dark and everything started falling on our heads," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It was good that my phone lit up, thanks to the flashlight I found where to go, but in front of us everything was burning already."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Epitsentr chain sells household and DIY goods.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As of now, we know that more than 200 people could have been inside the hypermarket," Zelensky said on Telegram, condemning the daylight attack on an "obviously civilian" target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia's TASS state news agency cited a security source as claiming that a missile strike destroyed a "military store and command post" inside the shopping centre.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The regional governor said there was "no contact with some of the staff" and "according to our information, visitors could still be in the building."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just a few dozen kilometres from the border and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles. (AFP)

    Barca avenge Lyon defeats to win third Women's CL

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bonmati celebrates after her deflected shot gives Barca the lead. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754706_1_20240526032142.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas struck to earn Barcelona their third women's Champions League trophy, securing a 2-0 triumph over record eight-time winners Lyon on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The defending champions had never beaten the French giants, losing in the 2019 and 2022 finals against them, but finally succeeded in Bilbao to compete a spectacular quadruple this season in coach Jonatan Giraldez's last match in charge.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bonmati pounced after 63 minutes and substitute Putellas finished the job in stoppage time to avenge Barcelona's prior defeats by Sonia Bompastor's side.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Securing their third Champions League trophy from five final appearances across the last six seasons, Barcelona demonstrated that they are the new powerhouse of the women's game.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Barca stars insisted this time they were capable of beating Lyon, adding experience and mental strength to their undoubted talent, and so it proved at a packed San Mames.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Backed by the vast majority of a 51,000 record crowd at a women's Champions League final, Bonmati and her side completed one of the few outstanding challenges remaining to them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Giraldez started Mariona Caldentey in attack and moved Fridolina Rolfo to left-back, dropping Ona Batlle to the bench alongside two-time Ballon d'Or winner Putellas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lyon left Ada Hegerberg on the bench too, with the all-time top scorer in the competition's history struggling for form after injury.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lucy Bronze deflected a ball onto her own crossbar and Lyon's towering captain Wendie Renard hit the outside of the post as Barcelona suffered a couple of early jitters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After going four goals down by half-time in the 2019 final and three down in 2022, this time the Catalans dug deep to hold it together at the back.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They threatened increasingly at the other end. Patri Guijarro, who scored twice in last year's final against Wolfsburg, broke in behind for their first big chance after half an hour.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Christiane Endler saved her effort from an angle and Selma Bacha cleared the ball off the line after it rebounded back towards goal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Caroline Graham Hansen, in sparkling form this season, gave left-back Bacha a torrid time and had 11-time finalist Renard uncertainly backpedalling fearfully near the end of the first half, but dragged her shot wide.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Barcelona made their quality count in the 63rd minute when Bonmati sent them ahead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Ballon d'Or winner had been quiet but arrived just at the right time to collect Caldentey's clever pass and burst into the area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bonmati's low shot deflected off Vanessa Gilles and flew over the helpless Endler, for her sixth goal of the tournament and the most crucial.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Champions League top goalscorer Kadidiatou Diani curled agonisingly over for Lyon as Bompastor's side tried to fight back. Hegerberg headed over as Lyon's chances ebbed away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Eventually Putellas, on as a late substitute, settled the game by rifling into the top corner late on to get Barcelona's celebrations started early. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Al-Ain thrashed 10-man Yokohama F Marinos 5-1 in the second leg of the Asian Champions League final on Saturday to lift the continental title for the first time in 21 years with a 6-3 aggregate win over the Japanese side.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The United Arab Emirates team overturned a 2-1 first-leg deficit, with Soufiane Rahimi and Kodjo Laba both scoring twice and Kaku also on target against a Marinos team for whom Yan Matheus scored and goalkeeper William Popp was sent off.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Al-Ain, who last won the title in 2003, levelled the aggregate score in the eighth minute, Rahimi slotting home after latching onto Yahia Nader's clever back heel and, by the 33rd minute, the home side had taken the lead in the tie.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rahimi was involved again, the Moroccan brought down by Shinnosuke Hatanaka to allow Paraguayan playmaker Kaku to step up and score from the penalty spot.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seven minutes later, however, Marinos struck when Khalid Eisa was unable to do enough to palm Matheus' low shot to safety and the aggregate score was level again.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marinos's task became more complicated deep into first half injury time when Popp was sent off for bringing down Rahimi as the Moroccan raced towards goal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rahimi then hit Al-Ain's crucial third in the 67th minute as he capitalised on the inability of the Marinos defence to clear, beating substitute goalkeeper Fuma Shirasaka with a left-foot shot inside his near post.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Substitute Laba struck twice after his late introduction – in the 91st and 95th minutes – following more poor defending to put the seal on a remarkable win. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 24 people were killed, most of them children, when a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in India on Saturday, officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Footage posted on social media showed a ferocious blaze engulfing a temporary structure, with black smoke pouring into the sky.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prabhav Joshi, the district collector of Rajkot, in the western state of Gujarat, said that 24 people had died in the inferno, "mostly children," and another half-dozen were hospitalised.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The police have detained four persons associated with the game zone for questioning," he said. "We are trying to get more details about the owners of the facility."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 300 people were in the two-storey structure at the TRP amusement and theme park when the blaze broke out as it was a summer holiday weekend, Rajkot fire officer Ilesh Kher told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "People got trapped as a temporary structure at the facility collapsed near the entrance, making it difficult for the people to come out," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The flames spread rapidly because of its flammable material, he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Pictures from the scene showed a corrugated metal structure largely in ruins.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gujarat is the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who posted on X: "Extremely distressed by the fire mishap in Rajkot. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. Prayers for the injured."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It took nearly an hour to douse the fire, with about a dozen ambulances carrying the injured to hospital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fire department officials said a short-circuit was suspected as the cause and police at the site said the bodies of the dead were heavily burned, making identification difficult.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erik ten Hag made a convincing case to be spared the sack as Manchester United upset Manchester City to take the FA Cup with a shock 2-1 victory in Saturday's final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag was reportedly set to be dismissed regardless of the result at Wembley after a troubled campaign that even the United manager described as "terrible" this week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But United's hierarchy might be having second thoughts after Ten Hag's tactical masterclass ruined City's history bid.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City were hot favourites to win a second successive Premier League and FA Cup double.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yet Ten Hag found a way to neutralise Pep Guardiola's side as first half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo put United on course to win the FA Cup for the first time in eight years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jeremy Doku squeezed an 87th minute strike past Andre Onana's weak attempted save but it was too late to rescue City.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Having ended a turbulent season on a high note, if Ten Hag's two-year reign does end, his exit would provoke memories of fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal's Old Trafford departure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Van Gaal was fired just two days after United's FA Cup final victory against Crystal Palace in 2016.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag will hope a more apt comparison is Alex Ferguson's 1990 FA Cup final win against Palace, which kick-started his remarkable run after calls for his sacking earlier that season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ferguson was in attendance as a match labelled Ten Hag's funeral turned into a triumph for the much-maligned Dutchman.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United shareholder Jim Ratcliffe, who has control of football operations at Old Trafford, was also watching from the stands alongside co-owners Joel and Avie Glazer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Linked with Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Gareth Southgate, among others, there is still plenty for Ratcliffe to ponder after United finished eighth in the Premier League this season – their lowest final position since 1990 – and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag believes a lengthy injury list was the root of the problems and can point to the two trophies he has won in three cup final appearances with United as proof of what he can do when his team are at full strength.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag ended United's six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last year and has now avenged their 2-1 loss to City in the FA Cup final 12 months ago despite finishing 31 points behind the champions this term.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United will also qualify for the Europa League, avoiding a first season without European action since 2014-15.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They benefitted from an unusually tepid City performance as their double bid fell flat in their first domestic defeat since losing at Aston Villa in the league 171 days ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last weekend, City became the first team to win the Premier League in four consecutive seasons.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Guardiola's men looked hungover after the celebrations that followed their sixth title in seven years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City were furious when their strong penalty appeal was rejected inside the first minute after Lisandro Martinez's shove sent Erling Haaland sprawling.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Content to sit deep with all 11 men behind the ball, United stifled City impressively and gleefully accepted their gift-wrapped opener in the 30th minute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Diogo Dalot's punt forward should have been dealt with by Josko Gvardiol, but the left-back hesitated as he looked for an offside flag.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gvardiol headed the ball over City keeper Stefan Ortega, who had rashly rushed off his line, leaving Garnacho with the simple task of tapping into the empty net as Ten Hag clenched his fist in celebration.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Garnacho, 19, was the first teenager to score in the FA Cup final since Cristiano Ronaldo for United against Millwall 20 years ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Just nine minutes later, the 19-year-old Mainoo punished more sloppy City defending.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Garnacho advanced unchecked down the right wing and found Fernandes, whose superb first-time pass reached the unmarked Mainoo for a clinical close-range finish.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City pushed harder after the interval but although Doku's shot slipped through Onana's grasp to set up a tense finale, it wasn't enough to deny United.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As the final seconds ticked away, Ten Hag stood in the sunshine nervously waiting to celebrate a dramatic win that could earn an unexpected stay of execution or serve as his final fling. (AFP)

    Nasa launches ground-breaking climate change satellite

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754695_1_20240525224751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tiny NASA satellite was launched on Saturday from New Zealand with the mission of improving climate change prediction by measuring heat escaping from Earth's poles for the first time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This new information – and we've never had it before – will improve our ability to model what's happening in the poles, what's happening in climate," Nasa's earth sciences research director Karen St Germain told a recent news conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The satellite, which is the size of a shoe box, was launched by an Electron rocket, built by a company called Rocket Lab, which lifted off from Mahia in the north of New Zealand. The overall mission is called Prefire.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company is later to launch a similar satellite of its own.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They will serve to take infrared measurements far above the Arctic and Antarctic so as to measure directly the heat that the poles release into space.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is critical because it actually helps to balance the excess heat that's received in the tropical regions and really regulate the earth's temperature," said Tristan L'Ecuyer, a mission researcher affiliated with the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "And the process of getting the heat from the tropical regions to the polar regions is actually what drives all of our weather around the planet," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With Prefire, Nasa aims to understand how clouds, humidity or the melting of ice into water affects this heat loss from the poles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Until now the models that climate change scientists used to gauge heat loss were based on theories rather than real observations, said L'Ecuyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hopefully we'll be able to improve our ability to simulate what sea level rise might look like in the future and also how the polar climate change is going to affect the weather systems around the planet," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Small satellites like this one are a low-cost way to answer very specific scientific questions, said St Germain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Larger satellites can be thought of as "generalists" and the small ones as "specialists," she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "NASA needs both," said St Germain. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of the time-travelling robot cat Doraemon on Saturday got a sneak preview of a forthcoming exhibition, as crowds gathered along Victoria Harbour for the world's first-ever drone show devoted to the beloved Japanese animated character.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The display lasted for more than 10 minutes with large crowds filling the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some people that RTHK spoke to said that the drone show was exciting, while others thought it was a little too short.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Saurabh Agarwal said he really enjoyed the accompanying sound and picture performance with his friends.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It was fantastic. We waited for more than an hour, and it was worth the wait. We actually missed the last show for drones," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This time we just came early to get a good place. This was fantastic and it was the first time I see drones in Hong Kong so I was very excited."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I really enjoyed it. It was brilliant. The drones performed brilliantly. I don't know anything about the cartoon character, but I really enjoyed the show," said Debra Gergson, who is visiting Hong Kong on vacation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Puneet Brar said she wished the show could have been longer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We really enjoyed the show and the graphics. It was an amazing production. I wish it was a little longer because I was enjoying myself a lot," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I thought it was really special and unique. You just can't see a drone show everyday."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier in the morning, visitors got to see dozens of huge models from the series at Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park in Sai Ying Pun.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A woman, surnamed Chan, was among those who went to see the Doraemon figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is so cute. The character is part of the childhood memories of many people, so it's very attractive," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It would be nice to have a longer exhibition or displays around different parts of Hong Kong... so that adults and kids can all come and take photos."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Free Doraemon balloons were also handed out in several busy districts in Hong Kong, including Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Causeway Bay and Central, with most of them distributed in about two hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The full exhibition, the first stop on a global tour and also listed on the government's "mega events calendar," gets under way on July 13 and runs until August 4, featuring a special animated short film.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 S K Lam from the event organiser said the film depicts one of the characters, Gian, mostly known for being an aggressive bully in the series, holding a concert in Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The film will be part of the paid exhibition, but fans can also visit large-scale figures of Doraemon for free at the Avenue of Stars.

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754689_1_20240525213215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli official said on Saturday the government had an "intention" to renew "this week" talks aimed at reaching a hostage release deal in Gaza, after a meeting in Paris between US and Israeli officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There is an intention to renew the talks this week and there is an agreement," the official said, on condition of anonymity.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Israeli official did not elaborate on the agreement, but Israeli media reported that Mossad chief David Barnea had agreed during meetings in Paris with mediators CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani on a new framework for the stalled negotiations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken also spoke with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz about new efforts to achieve a ceasefire and reopen the Rafah border crossing, Washington said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Talks aimed at reaching a hostage release and truce deal in the Gaza Strip ground to a halt this month after Israel launched a military operation in the territory's far-southern city of Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a based on Israeli official figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,903 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Uvalde families sue 'Call of Duty' gamemaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Floral tributes are placed outside the school in Uvalde after the 2022 shooting. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754667_1_20240525151710.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Families of the victims of the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, filed two lawsuits on Friday against Instagram's parent company Meta, Activision Blizzard and its parent Microsoft and the gunmaker Daniel Defense, claiming they cooperated to market dangerous weapons to impressionable teens such as the Uvalde shooter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Together, the wrongful death complaints argue that Daniel Defense – a Georgia-based gun manufacturer – used Instagram and Activision's video game Call of Duty to market its assault-style rifles to teenage boys, while Meta and Microsoft facilitated the strategy with lax oversight and no regard for the consequences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meta, Microsoft and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, a lobbying group representing the video game industry, said many other countries have similar levels of video game playing but less gun violence than the United States.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," the group said in a statement. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In one of the deadliest school shootings in history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when an 18-year-old gunman armed with a Daniel Defense rifle entered Robb Elementary School and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The complaints were filed on the two-year anniversary of the massacre by Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the same law firm that reached a US$73 million settlement with rifle manufacturer Remington in 2022 on behalf of families of children killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The first lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Meta's Instagram of giving gun manufacturers "an unsupervised channel to speak directly to minors, in their homes, at school, even in the middle of the night," with only token oversight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The complaint also alleges that Activision's popular warfare game Call of Duty "creates a vividly realistic and addicting theatre of violence in which teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease," using real-life weapons as models for the game's firearms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The second lawsuit, filed in Uvalde County District Court, accuses Daniel Defense of deliberately aiming its ads at adolescent boys in an effort to secure lifelong customers. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rogue emu was spotted pounding the streets of Tin Shui Wai on Saturday morning, shocking residents and rapidly going viral on social media.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Emus are normally found in the Australian outback, rather than Hong Kong public housing estates, but video widely shared online showed one of the flightless birds exploring different parts of the town in the northern New Territories.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Aside from the estate, the emu was spotted running up and down busy roads, at one point forcing a lorry driver to slam on the breaks to avoid a collision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After calls from people who saw the runaway at the junction of Tin Sau Road and Tin Ying Road, inspectors from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals moved in.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They were joined in the search by police officers and officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About three hours later, the emu found its way into the nearby wetlands park, where it was caught, uninjured, and handed over to the AFCD for safekeeping.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials say they've so far been unable to contact the farm the emu came from.

    Wide range of mega events a must for HK: minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wide range of mega events a must for HK: minister" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754651_1_20240525115010.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should not limit the kind of mega events it stages, culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Saturday, dismissing concerns that an abundance of shows and exhibitions could diminish their appeal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR has more than 100 mega events scheduled for the latter half of this year, from sporting contests to summits, but lawmaker Doreen Kong earlier said she's worried that too many big events would lead to a loss of focus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on an RTHK programme, Yeung said diversity was important to cater to different audiences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "For tourists, they may be travelling to Hong Kong for a week to participate in a mega event they are interested in...But in Hong Kong, it does seem that 200 mega events are a lot, with all sorts of shows and activities," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We hope that Hong Kong is a diverse place with many mega events, and different people who come here can find what they want to take part in. We also want to let everyone know that Hong Kong is capable and has hosted various types of mega events."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This year's mega events are expected to draw 1.7 million visitors, out of a predicted 46 million total arrivals. But the minister stressed that mega events were not the only away to attract tourists.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We do not solely rely on one aspect to attract people. We already have a number of projects, for example, existing tourist hotspots and in-depth tours. The estimated figure also do not include the number of people attending concerts," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So we shouldn't only look at the mega events on the roster. It's more about the atmosphere of the city after holding mega events, and making the city more attractive."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yeung also said the administration was in talks with the filmmakers behind the hit local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" about turning its set into a tourist site. The film attracted a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and has sparked international interest in its setting: the long-demolished Kowloon Walled City.

 But the minister also acknowledged the possibility of the filmmakers requiring the sets again to produce a prequel or sequel to the martial arts film.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Increasing penalties alone will not be enough to deal with the problem of property owners ignoring fire safety orders, a lawmaker said on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tony Tse made the comments after the government said this week that it intended to submit an amendment bill to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who ignore such instructions. It follows the deaths of five people in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan, a building subject to a series of fire safety notices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials are proposing to raise the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tony Tse, who represents the architectural, surveying, planning and landscape sectors, said legislation alone was not the answer and that owners should be informed that they are responsible for carrying out maintenance and repair work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “[For] those who have little knowledge or no knowledge about this area, we should all offer some sort of assistance. That could be coming from the government, or some professional institutions, as well as some volunteering persons who have knowledge about it," Tse said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Election Committee lawmaker Andrew Lam said that while it's "inevitable" that stricter penalties for non-compliance would be introduced, the government should strengthen inter-departmental cooperation to tackle such issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The group behind a 2019 protest song that's subject to a court injunction said on Friday evening that the distributor had now decided to remove it from all platforms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On social media, the group behind "Glory to Hong Kong" said it has expressed opposition to the decision, saying it hoped to have the song reinstated as soon as possible.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The group said the song had been removed from iTunes and Apple Music in various regions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Court of Appeal earlier granted a government request for a temporary injunction against anyone playing or performing the song with seditious intent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, has since restricted the viewing of 32 links related to the song in Hong Kong.

    Alec Baldwin set to face trial over movie shooting

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico judge on Friday rejected Alec Baldwin's bid to dismiss an involuntary manslaughter charge for the 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, opening the way for an unprecedented trial of a Hollywood actor for an on-set death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Baldwin's lawyers argued at a May 17 hearing that a grand jury indictment of the actor was "a sham" as prosecutors failed to tell jurors they could question defence witnesses and stopped them hearing evidence helpful to the actor's case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among her arguments in a court filing, district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said she did not find prosecutorial bad faith in the grand jury, nor error in jury instructions and prosecutors adequately advised jurors regarding a letter from Baldwin's legal team listing defence jurors they could call.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The court finds no error in the actions taken by the prosecutor vis-a-vi the reading of the evidence letter," Marlowe Sommer said in the filing
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The actor now faces a July 10 trial.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hutchins was shot with a live round after Baldwin pointed a gun at her as she set up a camera shot on a movie set near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The "30 Rock" actor maintains he did not pull the trigger, an assertion that has become central to the case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Much of the differences between prosecution and defence positions are factual disputes and that is the type of case juries are meant to decide, said business and entertainment trial litigator Tre Lovell.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At trial, Baldwin’s legal team must convince Santa Fe jurors there was a cascading failure in set firearms safety before the weapon was put in Baldwin’s hand,
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey has argued in court filings that Baldwin broke firearm safety rules by pointing the gun at Hutchins, cocking it and pulling the trigger.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sommer sentenced "Rust" armorer Hannah Gutierrez to 18 months prison in April after a Santa Fe jury found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter for loading the live round into the reproduction Colt Single Action Army revolver Baldwin was using. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 "Black Dog," about a man released from prison who returns home to his remote town in China to rid it of stray dogs before the Olympics, only to befriend one of them, won the Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" competition on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Eddie Peng, who stars as Lang in the film by director Guan Hu, attended the ceremony at Cannes along with greyhound Xin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was the second prize in one day for Xin, who donned the Palm Dog red collar after being picked for the Grand Jury Prize at a separate ceremony celebrating canine performances.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The "Un Certain Regard" jury prize went to the French film "The Story of Souleymane," director Boris Lojkine's feature about a Guinean immigrant's struggle to survive in Paris.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The best director prize was given to both Italy's Roberto Minervini for "The Damned" and Zambian-Welsh auteur Rungano Nyoni for "On Becoming a Guinea Fowl," while "Norah," by Saudi Arabian director Tawfik Alzaidi, received a special mention.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Canadian filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan headed this year's five-strong jury for the competition focused on arthouse films that runs parallel to the main competition, the Palme d'Or.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There were 18 films in total competing for the prize. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Algernon Yau, left, says Hong Kong businesses can do more to attract investors from the Middle East and Asean countries. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754529_1_20240524143042.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau says claims that Hong Kong was no longer the Pearl of the Orient and its status has been overtaken by Singapore were absolutely not true, citing the SAR’s unique advantage of its proximity to the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think it’s not true at all. Hong Kong has the advantage over the others because we have the back-up of the motherland. We are a super connector and a value adder,” Yau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The secretary for commerce and economic development said Hong Kong is positioned to capture business opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, which has a population of 86 million with GDP of US$1.3 trillion. The size of the GBA economy is comparable to that of South Korea or some northern European countries, Yau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Using Hong Kong as a gateway going into the Greater Bay Area is our advantage,” Yau told RTHK’s Your Home Address programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also highlighted that Hong Kong is the only common law city in China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The rule of law, free low of capital, good infrastructure and professional services… are all available in Hong Kong which are very competitive to any other economy in the world,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To attract more foreign businesses to operate in Hong Kong, Yau said, “We need to change”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister hailed a business trip led by the Chief Executive John Lee to the Middle East and Asean countries last year, adding that Hong Kong businesses need to look at how to accommodate new investors coming from those parts of the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The whole world is changing, the situation is evolving and we have to look at new opportunities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Without changing, we won’t be able to entertain the new investors, visitors or tourists coming from the Middle East especially,” the secretary said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yau also revealed that Hong Kong will be hosting a Belt and Road summit in September as part of a month-long Belt and Road festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister, whose policy portfolio also covers broadcasting, said he is trying to foster a more dynamic environment for the industry. He said there are more programmes on RTHK about education and culture on the mainland.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained lost ground on Friday to trade higher ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend, with renewed enthusiasm for generative AI-linked companies pushing Nvidia's share price.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent to 16,920, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,304.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones stabilised after tumbling on Thursday to close almost unchanged at 39,069.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While stocks often rise ahead of the Memorial day weekend, Friday's buoyant trading day also had Nvidia's recent streak to thank, said Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company, which sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in many generative AI products, saw its share price rise 2.6 percent on Friday, leaving it up more than 15 percent this week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We know that expectations were very high, and yet they seem to meet or exceed them on more than one level," he said. "So whether we like it or not, artificial intelligence now is an important factor when it comes to the stock market sentiment."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "And to the extent that Nvidia's numbers were able to meet or beat expectations that's supportive for the market," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Other tech companies that saw their share price jump on Friday include Advanced Micro Devices, which closed up 3.7 percent, and Intel, which finished 2.1 percent higher. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States on Friday announced a fresh tranche of military aid for Ukraine, including ammunition, missiles, mines and artillery rounds as Russia presses its assault on the Kharkiv region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ukraine has been battling back in Kharkiv since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The United States is announcing today a significant new drawdown of weapons and equipment for Ukraine to support the brave Ukrainian people as they defend their country," said Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This 275 million dollar package, which is part of our efforts to help Ukraine repel Russia's assault near Kharkiv, contains urgently needed capabilities."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last month, US lawmakers passed a long-delayed US$61 billion military aid deal for Kyiv after months of squabbling in Congress as Ukrainian forces suffered setbacks on the battlefield due to ammunition and funding shortages.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since then, President Joe Biden has ordered five tranches of military aid to be sent to Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Assistance from previous packages has already made it to the front lines, and we will move this new assistance as quickly as possible," Blinken said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Strikes on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, killed at least seven people on Thursday, local authorities said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 11,000 people in the wider region have been evacuated since Russia began its new offensive, according to local governor Oleg Synegubov. (AFP)

    SpaceX mega rocket Starship's next launch on June 5

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The last test took place on March 14, when Starship flew halfway around the planet. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754608_1_20240525004618.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starship, the world's most powerful rocket, is set for its next test flight on June 5, SpaceX announced on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The launch window from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas opens at 7:00 am local time (1200 GMT), pending regulatory approval.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It will be the fourth test for the sleek mega rocket, which is vital to Nasa's plans for landing astronauts on the Moon later this decade, and to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's hopes of eventually colonising Mars.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Three previous attempts have ended in the Starship's destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy," SpaceX said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Super Heavy is the booster, while Starship refers to both the upper stage and the two stages combined.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The flight path will be similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly halfway around the globe before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This time around, SpaceX hopes to achieve a soft splashdown for the booster stage in the Gulf of Mexico, and a "controlled entry" for the upper stage.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Designed to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 121 metres tall with both stages combined – 27 metres taller than the Statue of Liberty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, almost double that of the world's second most powerful rocket, Nasa's Space Launch System – though the latter is now certified, while Starship is still a prototype.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 SpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for Nasa and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for Nasa's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the lander vehicle. (AFP)

 The United Nations warned on Friday that escalating fighting in conflict-torn Myanmar's Rakhine State had forced around 45,000 minority Rohingya to flee, amid allegations of killings and burnings of property.

 "Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced in recent days by the fighting in Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships," UN rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told reporters in Geneva.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "An estimated 45,000 Rohingya have reportedly fled to an area on the Naf River near the border with Bangladesh, seeking protection," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Clashes have rocked Rakhine since the Arakan Army (AA) attacked forces of the ruling junta in November, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since a military coup in 2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The AA says it is fighting for more autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine population in the state, which is also home to around 600,000 members of the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Rakhine in 2017 during a crackdown by the military that is now the subject of a United Nations genocide court case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Over a million Rohingya are already in Bangladesh, having fled past purges," Throssell pointed out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UN rights chief Volker Turk was urging Bangladesh and other countries "to provide effective protection to those seeking it, in line with international law, and to ensure international solidarity with Bangladesh in hosting Rohingya refugees in Myanmar", she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Novak Djokovic fell to 44th-ranked Czech Tomas Machac, 6-4, 0-6, 6-1, in the semi-finals in Geneva on Friday ahead of his French Open title defence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Djokovic, 37, took a wild card to the Swiss clay-court tournament in a bid to reverse an alarming dip in form ahead of Roland Garros where the 24-time Grand Slam champion has won three times.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have no reaction right now, I just fought for every ball," said 23-year-old Machac.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "When you play against Novak you just hope. You just try to play your best and see what it looks like."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Djokovic, bidding to reach his first final of the season, received a medical timeout at the end of the first set.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Serb will head to Roland Garros where he faces Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the first round having won no titles this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Machac, competing in his maiden tour-level semi-final, rallied from a break down in the first set and after failing to win a game in the second powered back in the third set.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm looking forward to playing in a final for the first time," said Machac who will face two-time champion Casper Ruud or Italian Flavio Cobolli in the title match on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ruud, the world number seven, was the runner-up in the last two French Open finals, including a defeat to Djokovic last year. (AFP)

    World Court orders Israel to stop Rafah offensive

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754601_1_20240524214259.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Judges at the top United Nations court ordered Israel on Friday to halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Reading out a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or World Court, the body's president Nawaf Salam said provisional measures ordered by the court in March did not fully address the situation in the besieged Palestinian enclave, and conditions had been met for a new emergency order.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive" in Rafah, he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The court backed a South African request to order Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a week after Pretoria called for the measure in a case accusing Israel of genocide.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel has repeatedly dismissed the case's accusations of genocide as baseless, arguing in court that its operations in Gaza are self-defence and targeted at Hamas militants who attacked Israel on October 7.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An Israeli government spokesman said "no power on Earth would stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel launched its assault on the southern city of Rafah this month, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee a city that had become a refuge to around half of the population's 2.3 million people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While the ruling by the ICJ is a blow to Israel's international standing, the court does not have a police force to enforce its orders. In another case on its docket, Russia has so far ignored a 2022 order by the court to halt its military campaign in Ukraine.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers universities in the United States defended their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force, telling a US House committee on Thursday that they defused the danger without ceding ground to protesters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We had to get the encampment down,” Northwestern's Michael Schill said. “The police solution was not going to be available to us to keep people safe, and also may not be the wisest solution as we’ve seen at other campuses across the country.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Schill and Jonathan Holloway of Rutgers were called before the House Education and the Workforce Committee as part of a series of hearings examining how colleges have responded to allegations of antisemitism.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Also testifying was Gene Block, chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, which has come under scrutiny for a delayed police response to violence between pro-Palestinian protesters and counter-protesters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The committee’s inquiry expanded to large, public universities, UCLA and Rutgers, after earlier hearings largely focused on private, Ivy League colleges.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Philadelphia, protesters packed up their belongings and left a pro-Palestinian encampment at Drexel University after the school announced a decision to have police clear the encampment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 University President John Fry said in a statement that he decided to have campus police and public safety officers join Philadelphia police in clearing the encampment as peacefully as possible.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 News outlets reported that police gave protesters a warning to clear the encampment and the protesters left.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of students in graduation robes walked out of the Harvard University commencement chanting “Free, free Palestine” after weeks of protests on campus and a day after the school announced that 13 students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk” during Thursday’s commencement, referring to allowing those 13 students to get their diplomas along with fellow graduates. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese dog whose photo inspired a generation of oddball online jokes and the US$23-billion Dogecoin cryptocurrency died on Friday, her owner said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She quietly passed away as if asleep while I caressed her," Atsuko Sato wrote on her blog, thanking the fans of her shiba inu called Kabosu – the face of the "Doge" meme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Kabo-chan was the happiest dog in the world. And I was the happiest owner," Sato wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a rescue dog, Kabosu's real birthday was unknown but Sato estimated her age at 18, past the average lifespan for a shiba inu, with her birthday celebrated in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2010, two years after adopting Kabosu from a puppy mill where she would otherwise have been put down, Sato took a picture of her pet crossing her paws on the sofa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She posted that image – with the fluffy shiba inu giving the camera a beguiling look – on her blog, from where it spread to online forum Reddit and became a meme that bounced from college bedrooms to office e-mail chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The memes typically used goofy broken English to reveal the inner thoughts of Kabosu and other shiba inu "doge" – pronounced like pizza "dough" but with a "j" at the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The picture also later became an NFT digital artwork that sold for US$4 million and inspired Dogecoin, which was started as a joke by two software engineers and is now the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency with a market capitalisation of US$23 billion. (AFP)

    US sanctions will have no impact on DoJ: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said any US sanctions aimed at Hong Kong judges and officials will have no impact on the Department of Justice.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam's comment came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on a number of SAR officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Blinken said this was in response to what he described as "an intensifying crackdown on rights and freedoms" in Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on his return from an official visit to the Middle East, Lam reiterated his opposition to any such sanctions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As we have reiterated many times, these actions and statements violate fundamental principles of international law. Secondly, these remarks or expressions will absolutely not affect me personally or the work of our Department of Justice. They will not have the slightest impact whatsoever," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The justice chief also said he explained Hong Kong's common law system to the business sector in the Middle East during his five-day trip there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam said there are many opportunities for cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, as the SAR can help connect investors and businesspeople there to China and the rest of the world.

    Lawmakers differ on pushing or shelving waste charging

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday were divided on the way forward for the planned citywide waste charging scheme, with one believing the policy should not go to waste.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a paper to the Legislative Council, the administration said people who took part in a trial believed the measure was causing a nuisance to the public and complained the designated bags would be too expensive.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Legislator Tik Chi-yuen, from the Third Side, said the city should continue pushing for the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We have sufficient conditions to continue with the plan. It doesn't matter what the policy will be called, whether it's a second phase of the trial, or operating it in different modes," Tik told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We should introduce this scheme to places with management capabilities, including public housing, subsidised housing, large-scale private residential estates, as well as premises of the government and the public sector."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But DAB lawmaker, Edward Lau, said the government should shelve the waste charging scheme "indefinitely". He said introducing the policy on schedule would cause chaos.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The government should hold off on introducing the scheme and look into areas that should be improved. That's because many issues were reflected in the report and it's impossible to fail to deal with them," Lau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Only when conditions permit and the timing is right, then the government can bring it back to Legco for discussions."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kwok Wai-keung from the Federation of Trade Unions said it could be worth amending the time frame in which to roll out the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Other than strengthening our recycling facilities, we hope the government can provide a detailed timetable. If we are going to carry out works on waste charging and reduction, the government should say how many stages should there be," Kwok said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said there should be a test run for everyone to take part in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army on Friday continued joint drills surrounding Taiwan Island.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Integrated operations inside and outside the island chain are being conducted to test the command's capabilities to jointly take control of battlefield and launch joint strikes, and to seize control of crucial areas, according to Li Xi, spokesperson for the theatre command.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A coast guard fleet conducted law-enforcement drills in the waters east of the island.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said the drills focused on subjects including verification and identification as well as warning and expulsion to test the capabilities of joint maritime patrol and emergency response.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China said the two-day military exercises, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, were launched to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and strongly punish separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end and China will never waver in its resolve to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday said a number of people who trialled the pay-as-you-throw scheme think the government should hold off on rolling out the plan to everyone in August, believing the measure was causing a nuisance to the public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But in a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Environment and Ecology Bureau gave no indication of what would be next for the municipal solid waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials began trialling the scheme at 14 locations from April, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said the bags were used 70 percent of the time at shopping malls participating in the test run, but there were fewer residents who used them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The average usage rate [of designated bags] at public and private housing buildings ranged from only about 20 percent to more than 50 percent, and only around 20 percent at 'three-nil' buildings," the paper said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A "three-nil" building is one which does not have an owners' corporation or any form of residents' organisation, nor does it employ a property management company to manage the building.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials said many residents thought charging for disposed waste was causing a nuisance and complained the bags would be too expensive, while voicing concerns that littering would happen more often once the measure took effect.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some also believed it was difficult to understand how to dispose of items larger than the designated bags, the bureau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "[Residents polled] suggested to scrap waste charging or let society fully understand and prepare for it, thus it is not appropriate to introduce the scheme as scheduled on August 1," the paper said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau noted that frontline cleaning staff had seen their workload increase from handling trash that was not thrown out properly.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some expressed a concern about conflicts with residents when the policy was introduced or even breaking the law unknowingly, with certain individuals planning to quit because of the scheme, officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For restaurants, shops and care homes, they pointed to a rise in operating costs and recommended improving the design of larger garbage bags.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The administration said certain locations, such as residential blocks, care homes, restaurants and government premises, saw a 10 to 20 percent decrease in the amount of garbage disposed during the test run.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added there was a rise in the type and amount of recyclables collected.
