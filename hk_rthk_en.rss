    Part of DSE Chinese history exam optional from 2026

Part of DSE Chinese history exam optional from 2026
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751644_1_L_20240503160736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Friday said students taking Chinese History in the DSE exams will be allowed to skip part of the test from 2026.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the new arrangement, pupils can choose to take only a compulsory test that covers Chinese historical events ranging from the ancient Xia dynasty to the mid-19th century, or they can also sit a paper that focuses on the political, religious, social and other aspects of different periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students only sitting the compulsory paper will be able to get a grade 5 at most, while those who sit the two papers can get up to 5**.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said students will not need to disclose to the exam authority if they are skipping a test, so they will not be labelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it has not consulted the sector extensively on the move because the syllabus and assessment method are not being changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they want to give students more choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to allow more students who are interested to take Chinese history, or let students study the subject according to their ability," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course teachers will need to think about how to allocate lesson time and take care of students of different ability levels. I believe this won't be difficult as we implement the change and teachers become experienced."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teachers will need to have a teaching plan ready when the new academic year starts in September for form five students who plan to only take the mandatory test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Hon-kuen who heads Education Convergence, a body consisting of teachers and principals, said it will not be hard to cater to two groups of students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the students can study in the library while others spend more time in the classroom. Or, if the teachers and principals are more dedicated, they can break the students into two groups and teach them separately," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Wai-hung, a senior Chinese history teacher at Fukien Secondary School (Siu Sai Wan), said it may be difficult to split students into two groups when there are not many taking the subject.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said Hong Kong has just experienced the warmest April on record, with the hottest day reaching almost 32 degrees Celsius.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The monthly mean temperature was 26.4 degrees – 3.4 degrees higher than usual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said the hot weather was down to a warmer than normal sea surface temperature and unusually strong southerly air flows over the northern part of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Affected by an anticyclone aloft and the subsequent southerly airstream, it was generally fine and hot during the day from April 11 to 17. With plenty of sunshine, the temperatures at the observatory rose to a maximum of 31.9 degrees on the afternoon of April 13, the highest of the month,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster added that the SAR was also a lot wetter than usual last month, with total rainfall of 257.1 millimetres – almost 70 percent more than usual.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said less than half of households participating in a trial run of a pay-as-you-throw scheme have been using the designated bags for rubbish disposal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said between 20 and 50 percent of households have been making use of the bags since they were given them last month, with the rate even lower in buildings that aren't run by management companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the department said most of the care homes, restaurants and government buildings taking part in the trial scheme have adopted the designated bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said they are aware that some businesses have seen their operational costs rise due to using the bags and officials will report these concerns to lawmakers on May 27.

    Orangutan seen apparently treating wound

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A male Sumatran orangutan named Rakus is seen two months after wound self-treatment using a medicinal plant. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751628_1_L_20240503133421.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists have observed an orangutan applying medicinal herbs to a face wound in an apparently successful attempt to heal an injury, the first time such behaviour has been recorded.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Primates have previously been seen eating plants or rubbing them on themselves in behaviour scientists theorised was intended to ward off disease or discomfort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the apparent treatment seen by researchers in Indonesia in 2022, and reported in the journal Nature Scientific Reports on Thursday, is the first time a wild animal has been seen applying medicinal plants to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists were tracking a male orangutan nicknamed Rakus at the Gunung Leuser National Park in Indonesia's Aceh province when they noticed an open wound on his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three days later, they spotted him chewing the leaves of a vine called Fibraurea tinctoria, which is known for its medicinal properties and has long been used in local traditional medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The orangutan "began chewing the leaves without swallowing them and using his fingers to apply the plant juice from his mouth directly onto his facial wound," said the study by Indonesian and German scientists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When flies began to land on the site, Rakus "smeared the entire wound with the plant pulp until the red flesh was fully covered with the green leaf material."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next day, Rakus was seen eating the vine's leaves again, and a week later his wound had closed up, subsequently healing without any sign of infection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study describes the behaviour as the "first systematically documented case of active wound treatment with a plant species known to contain biologically active substances by a wild animal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said it was impossible to be sure the behaviour was intentional, but the fact that the juice and leaves were applied repeatedly and only to the wound suggests Rakus was trying to treat his injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They speculate the orangutan could have stumbled across the treatment, perhaps by first chewing the plant and then finding the juice offered pain relief when accidently touching it to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orangutans are known to learn skills from each other through observation, but the scientists said they had no record of similar behaviour in 21 years and 28,000 observation hours in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rakus however had moved to the region from elsewhere, raising the possibility he learned the medical technique from a different community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observation adds to a growing body of evidence about the way primates use plants to keep healthy, including swallowing whole leaves that have anti-parasitic properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in Indonesia, orangutans have been seen rubbing the chewed leaves of a different plant into their skin, possibly to harness its anti-inflammatory properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in 2022, scientists reported on chimpanzees in Gabon that were seen apparently applying insects to wounds. (AFP)

Data of 17,000 public housing tenants leaked

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The data of around 17,000 people who were required to undergo Covid tests at the peak of the pandemic has been exposed online, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has warned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the department said names, phone numbers, identity card numbers and addresses of residents were collected during lockdown operations between March and July in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The information was stored on an online server accessible to authorised staff using a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on April 30 this year, EMSD was told by the city's privacy watchdog that some information was accessible without the need for a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents of 14 public housing blocks are affected including those living in Yan Ching House of Kai Ching Estate in Kai Tak, Oi Ming House of Yau Oi Estate in Tuen Mun and Fu Leung House of Fu Cheong Estate in Sham Shui Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said it will launch an investigation but has not received any complaints so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think the situation is serious. We will initiate an investigation according to our normal procedures. We also suggest that the relevant department inform the affected individuals as soon as possible, given the relatively large number of people impacted," Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EMSD apologised for the incident, adding that it will notify the households affected by mail and "there is no evidence that relevant data has been published so far".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The matter has been reported to the police, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Security Bureau.

 The Chang'e-6 lunar probe is scheduled to be launched between 5pm and 6pm on Friday, with the preferred launch window targeted at 5.27pm, said the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's mysterious far side, the first endeavour of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Indiana Pacers powered into the second round of the NBA playoffs on Thursday, thrashing the depleted Milwaukee Bucks 120-98 to win their Eastern Conference series 4-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unable to close out the Bucks on Tuesday, the Pacers got their uptempo offence flowing again, relentlessly pulling away after trailing by seven points in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton delivered a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists, but it was reserve guard Obi Toppin leading the Pacers scoring with a career playoff high 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TJ McConnell added 20 points off the bench along with nine assists and four steals as the Pacers reserves contributed a whopping 50 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of the perseverance," Haliburton said of Toppin and McConnell. "Obviously neither of them had a really good game last game -- none of us did. We just responded the right way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana led by 12 at halftime, and after the Bucks cut the deficit to seven on a Brook Lopez layup with 1:05 left in the third the Pacers authored an 11-0 scoring run and romped away in the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight-time All-Star Damian Lillard returned from a two-game injury absence and led the Bucks with 28 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lopez and Bobby Portis scored 20 points apiece, but with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by the calf injury suffered late in the regular season the Bucks couldn't find an answer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks, who won the title in 2021, lost in the first round for the second straight season after falling to Miami last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers hadn't won a playoff series since 2014, when they reached the Eastern Conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Eastern Conference semi-finals Indiana will take on either the second-seeded New York Knicks or the Philadelphia 76ers, who clashed later Thursday in Philadelphia with the Sixers trying to stave off elimination. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pinpoint headed goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Nicolas Jackson earned Chelsea a 2-0 victory over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Thursday, dealing a blow to Spurs' hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former academy defender Chalobah diverted the ball expertly into the top corner from a Conor Gallagher free kick 35 metres out in the 24th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Chelsea a deserved lead after sustained pressure from the home side with chances for Mykhailo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke. Spurs defender Micky van de Ven kept his side in the match, with last-ditch tackles in the area and a clearance off the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham's Australian coach Ange Postecoglou looked furious in the dugout throughout the first 45 minutes and his side came out of the second half with greater verve and determination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But efforts by Son Heung-min and Pedro Porro were blocked and saved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senegal's Jackson calmed home nerves against the run of play in the 72nd minute when he was on hand to head home after a free kick from Chelsea top scorer Cole Palmer hit the bar and bounced down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three points, taking them to eighth, were vital for the push by Chelsea, under former Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino, towards a Europa League place after a disappointing season but left Tottenham seven points adrift of the top four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are in a good place," Pochettino said. "We have amazing professionals working on set-pieces. The team really showed in the way we wanted to build this way to play."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described the first half as fantastic. "Then you have to contain and suffer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou took responsibility for the defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like we've lost a bit of belief and conviction in our football and that is on me to change that," he said. "We were nowhere near good enough. That is on me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham have a poor record against their southwest London rivals. They lost the home fixture last November 4-1 and have won only one of their last 10 meetings. (Reuters)

    Sabalenka sets up Swiatek rematch in Madrid Open final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sabalenka had lost three of her last four clashes against Rybakina. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751599_1_L_20240503092119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Madrid Open champion Aryna Sabalenka produced a brilliant comeback from a set and a break down to beat Elena Rybakina and reach the final on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Belarusian second seed triumphed 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 [7/5] and will face world number one Iga Swiatek on Saturday in a rematch of last year's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinical Swiatek earlier eased past American Madison Keys with a comfortable 6-1, 6-3 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw third seed Daniil Medvedev retired injured from his quarter-final clash with Jiri Lehecka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka, 25, sealed her victory with a typically powerful serve that Rybakina could not control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitter had lost three of her last four clashes against the 24-year-old but emerged triumphant as they met on clay for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek has a 6-3 record against Sabalenka but in their only match in the Spanish capital, the latter triumphed in three sets a year ago to claim the title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominant on clay, Swiatek barely put a foot wrong against Keys, making just eight unforced errors in the match to leave the 29-year-old American with virtually no chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Medvedev struggled through to the end of the first set against Lehecka with an apparent upper thigh problem, losing it 6-4 before retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech progressed to his first Masters 1000 semi-final, where he will face Felix Auger Aliassime, who received a walkover after top seed Jannik Sinner withdrew Wednesday with a hip problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taylor Fritz will face Andrey Rublev in the other semi-final on Friday, after the Russian ousted home favourite Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Boris Johnson caught out by his own photo ID law

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751579_1_L_20240503051510.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British prime minister Boris Johnson, who introduced a contentious requirement for voters to show photo ID while voting, was turned away from a polling station on Thursday for forgetting to bring his.
 <br>
  <br/>
  British media reported that Johnson, who quit in 2022 following a scandal-ridden premiership, was initially turned away at a polling station in Oxfordshire, southern England, while trying to vote in local elections taking place across England on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said Johnson had voted Conservative but did not deny that the ex-PM had initially failed to produce photo ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As prime minister, Johnson's government introduced the ID requirement in 2022 to crack down on possible voter fraud but it was heavily criticised for the potential to disenfranchise parts of the electorate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously, voters only needed to give their name and address to be able to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it's unreasonable to ask first-time voters to produce some evidence of identity," Johnson had said of the new rules in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, in the first vote where the new rules were implemented, around 14,000 people in England were denied a vote in local elections after being unable to provide ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident is the latest in what has been a colourful political career for Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As London mayor he was once left dangling in the air when he got stranded on a zip wire, and as prime minister he was once pictured appearing to retreat into a large refrigerator while being pursued by a camera crew for an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poll by YouGov showed 14 percent of Britons were still unaware, in the days prior to Thursday's elections, of the voter ID requirement. (Reuters)

    Apple beats Q1 expectations, announces share buyback
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Apple has announced its biggest ever share buyback. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751578_1_L_20240503051021.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday reported a smaller than expected decline in quarterly revenue, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company expects a return to sales growth in the current quarter as it invests in AI features to be unveiled in the coming months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apple increased its cash dividend by 4 percent and authorised an additional programme to buy back US$110 billion of its stock. The buyback is the largest in the company's history, according to Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Apple surged roughly 7 percent in extended trade after the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple said fiscal second-quarter revenue fell 4 percent to US$90.8 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of US$90.01 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Apple's current quarter, which ends in June, Cook said the iPhone maker expects "to grow low-single digits" in overall revenue. Wall Street expects 1.33 percent revenue growth to US$82.89 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple faces a raft of challenges across its business. Smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics have introduced competing devices aimed at hosting artificial-intelligence chatbots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the regulatory front, Apple's services business, which contains its lucrative App Store and was one of the few areas of growth in the fiscal second quarter, is under pressure from a new law in Europe. In the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market and driving up prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the fiscal second quarter, IPhone sales fell 10.5 percent to US$45.96 billion, compared with analyst expectations of US$46 billion. Apple executives said in February that the year-ago fiscal second quarter had benefited from a US$5 billion surge in iPhone sales as the company caught up from supply-chain snarls during pandemic lockdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling 10 percent this year. (Reuters)

    Dovish Fed talk helps Wall Street rally

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Thursday as investors weighed the Federal Reserve's more dovish-than-expected interest rate guidance on Wednesday against a plethora of mixed earnings and economic data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three indexes ended in positive territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way, advancing 1.5 percent with a healthy boost from chip stocks after Qualcomm reported quarterly sales and profit above analysts' expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets continued to parse Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assurances on Wednesday that the central bank's next policy move will be to lower its key policy rate, after it left rates unchanged at the end of its monthly meeting. However, he noted that recent strong inflation readings have suggested that first of these rate cuts could be a long time in coming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The takeaway from yesterday is that the Fed's bias is still a downward, hold steady or cut rates," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist at Murphy & Silvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're not willing to raise rates from here. They'll keep rates steady, and any sign of economic weakness or lower inflation, they are going to be ready to jump on it and cut."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data released on Thursday included muted jobless claims, a drop in planned layoffs, a surge in quarterly labour costs and a sharp deceleration in productivity, all of which throws focus on Friday's closely watched April employment report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed has been consistent in saying they're going to be data dependent," said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. "We went into this year thinking there could be more cuts, earlier. "The data hasn't supported that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, Qualcomm advanced 9.8 percent following its earnings beat. Shares of used car platform Carvana surged 33.8 percent on its upbeat profit forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But disappointing profit guidance sent DoorDash's stock down 10.3 percent. Etsy shares slid 15.0 percent after the online marketplace missed Wall Street expectations for first-quarter gross merchandise sales and profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peloton dropped 2.5 percent after the fitness equipment maker's CEO stepped down and the company announced a 15 percent cut to its global workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.85 percent, to 38,226. The S&P 500 gained 0.91 percent, at 5,064 and the Nasdaq Composite added  1.51 percent, at 15,841. (Reuters)

 Thousands of demonstrators blocked a key intersection in Georgia's capital of Tbilisi on Thursday, as protests against a law on "foreign agents" in the country continue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The protesters blocked Heroes' Square through which moves most of the traffic between the city's neighbourhoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia's parliament on Wednesday approved the second reading of a bill on "foreign agents" that has been criticised as Kremlin-inspired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, has sparked a political crisis in the South Caucasus country. (Reuters)

    Trump says he may not accept result in key state

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump says he will only accept results that are honest. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751569_1_L_20240503012422.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump said he may not accept the 2024 election results in Wisconsin, a key battleground state in his matchup with US President Joe Biden, leaving open the possibility of post-election turmoil.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Wednesday, Trump said that if he doesn’t believe the result in November's election was legitimate, “you have to fight for the right of the country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump added, “If everything’s honest, I will absolutely accept the results.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential candidate's comments came on the heels of an interview this week with Time magazine in which Trump did not rule out the possibility of political violence around the election, saying “it depends on the fairness” of the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Journal Sentinel interview, Trump reiterated his claim that he won Wisconsin – a Midwestern state he lost to Biden, a Democrat, by about 21,000 votes in 2020 – and that the election was tainted by fraud. Trump's campaign unsuccessfully sought to disqualify almost 240,000 ballots cast for Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump won Wisconsin over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, and his rematch this year with Biden is expected to be tight. He held campaign rallies on Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan, another battleground state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said in the newspaper interview he won’t hesitate to raise doubts about the election if he’s convinced something is amiss with the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd be doing a disservice to the country if I said otherwise," Trump said. "But no, I expect an honest election and we expect to win maybe very big." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden broke his silence on campus unrest over the war in Gaza on Thursday, saying Americans have the right to demonstrate but not to unleash violence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There is a right to protest, but not a right to cause chaos," Biden said in remarks at the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With television images of campus unrest that have swept the country in recent days playing out on news networks, Biden has faced criticism of his handling of the situation. He had been leaving it largely up to his spokespeople to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democratic president, seeking re-election in November, has walked a careful line of denouncing antisemitism while supporting young Americans' right to protest and trying to limit longer-term political damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said both sides had a point, that peaceful dissent was critical to a democracy but that violence would not be tolerated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelling of classes and graduations -none of this is a peaceful protest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the United States was not an authoritarian nation that silences critics but that "order must prevail."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Dissent is essential to democracy but dissent must never lead to disorder or denying the rights of others so students can't finish the semester and college education," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, asked whether state governors should call in National Guard troops to restore order if necessary, replied "no."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to a reporter's question, Biden said the campus protests had not forced him to reconsider his policies in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student protesters are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and demanding schools divest from companies that support Israel's government. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of helmeted police swarmed the site of a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of California at Los Angeles early on Thursday, arresting demonstrators and dismantling their encampment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pre-dawn police crackdown at UCLA marked the latest flashpoint in mounting tensions on US college campuses, where protests over Israel's war in Gaza have led to student clashes with each other and with law enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to moving in, police urged demonstrators in repeated loudspeaker announcements to clear the protest zone, which occupied a central plaza about the size of a football field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After massing around the campus for hours, officers eventually moved through the area in lines holding batons as protesters - some in white helmets - linked arms, attempting to block their advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live TV footage showed officers taking down tents and removing the encampment, while arrested protesters sat with their hands restrained behind their backs with zip-ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students have rallied or set up tent encampments at dozens of universities in recent days, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and demanding schools divest from companies that support Israel's government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many colleges, including Columbia University in New York City, have called in police to quell the protests. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they believe a suspected burglar, who died after being found unconscious at Lantau's Sea Ranch, had fallen from height.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the mainland man, who's 37, crossed the border on a two-way permit on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They suspect he was part of a gang of three burgling homes at the isolated resort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents from five homes reported that their place had been broken into, with HK$7,000 and some cigarettes missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said two of the suspects had returned to the mainland on Wednesday, and they would seek help from their mainland counterparts if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they found a trail of blood from one of the blocks at the resort, adding the deceased had a blow to his head, with his jaw and teeth broken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An autopsy would be conducted to establish the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers added they had received four reports of burglary at Sea Ranch since last December, and investigations were ongoing. No arrests have been made over those cases so far.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's securities regulator says it has started an insider dealing prosecution against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751549_1_L_20240502212148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    RTHK launches new programmes in May

RTHK launches new programmes in May
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751535_1_L_20240502190409.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a series of new programmes from May, covering topics from news and current affairs to youth, family, and community activities, as well as education and culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new programmes will be broadcast across RTHK's eight channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony on Thursday, RTHK’s assistant director, Vincent Lee, said RTHK is committed to innovative production, nurturing new talent, and recruiting skilled individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that over 80 new employees joined the public broadcaster following multiple rounds of civil service recruitment conducted in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that pure audio content was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the public and the broadcaster would utilise more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to visualise radio programmes and distribute content across different platforms to reach a wider audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, he said RTHK’s productions would deepen its connection with the mainland to tell good stories of Hong Kong and China - as 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK would also provide comprehensive coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the 2025 National Games, through television, radio, and new media platforms, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK's director of broadcasting Eddie Cheung, vice chairman of the Board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority Bernard Chan and chairman of RTHK Board of Advisors Lam Tai-fai also attended the ceremony.

    HK logs 'better-than-expected' growth in Q1

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's economy grew 2.7 percent year on year in the first three months of 2024, according to official advanced estimates. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751525_1_L_20240502181916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s economy grew at a better-than-expected rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter, partially boosted by the steady rise in exports of goods and services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, that growth was lower compared with the 4.3 percent figure seen in the last quarter of 2023, according to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the city’s finance chief indicated that first quarter growth would be in line with the projected full-year growth range at between 2.5 and 3.5 percent for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Simon Lee, honorary fellow at Chinese University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Business, said the number was better than expected, but noted the momentum might not be sustainable in the coming quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My original estimate [for the first quarter] was about one to two percent growth. But the 2.7 percent growth also came on a relatively low base in the first quarter last year when the borders just opened and economic activities were just reactivated,” Lee told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see that it’s quite remarkable in terms of exports and imports of goods and services [in the first quarter]… but if you look at local consumption… quite a number of local people went elsewhere for spending and this will have a significant effect on the GDP growth.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[Although] exports tend to do well at the end of the year, there are also variable factors, such as the economic situation on the mainland and geopolitical issues, so I am still quite cautious on the full-year growth,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee warned Hong Kong could see growth slow to about one or two percent in the coming quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysing the major economic components, the growth of private consumption, capital formation, as well as the imports of goods and services all slowed during the three-month period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, exports of goods increased by 6.7 percent year on year, significantly higher compared with the 2.8 percent growth seen in the final quarter of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports of services rose by a notable 8.1 percent year on year in the quarter, although the pace was much slower compared with the 21.2 percent growth seen in Q4 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, exports of services should be supported by further revival of inbound tourism alongside the continued recovery of handling capacity and the government's efforts to promote a mega event economy,” a government spokesperson commented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Domestically, rising household income and the government's initiatives to boost sentiment should help private consumption, but the changing consumption pattern of residents may pose challenges. [And] a longer period of tight financial conditions may have some dampening effects on economic confidence and activities,” the spokesperson added.

    Inland Revenue expects 12% rise in tax collection

Inland Revenue expects 12% rise in tax collection
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751510_1_L_20240502164437.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Inland Revenue Department on Thursday said it expects a 12 percent increase in the amount of tax it collects this year, following a drop last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures show the department collected HK$342 billion in the last tax year, which was HK$18.2 billion or about five percent lower than in 2022-23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said it expects tax revenue to rise to HK$382 billion this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said stamp duty revenue is likely to hit HK$71 billion this year, following a 30 percent decrease to HK$49.1 billion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commissioner of Inland Revenue Tam Tai-pang noted that the city's "spicy" property cooling measures were scrapped in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The year 2023-24 had seen a significant drop in property market transactions... and that contributed largely to a significant drop in the stamp duty collections for the year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that after the abolition of all the demand-side management measures for residential properties, there's a notable increase in property transactions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it has sent out about 2.44 million tax returns for individuals for the 2023-24 financial year. People have until June 3 to post them back, or until July 3 if the returns are filed via e-Tax.

Waste-charging trial to continue this month: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the pay-as-you-throw trial would continue this month as planned, despite feedback that cleaners and participants are having a hard time with the scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government selected 14 buildings and premises to test the waste-charging scheme, which began last month, with participants using designated garbage bags and tags to dispose of their rubbish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had earlier delayed the scheme's full rollout from April to August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Warner Cheuk, said that there were still many problems with the trial, and that there must be "public consensus and favourable conditions" to roll out the scheme smoothly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said officials were aware the scheme had increased the workload of cleaners and that some participants found it troublesome, adding the government would carefully look into these matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they would faithfully report these issues to lawmakers at a meeting planned before the end of this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The waste charging scheme really affects the whole population," the minister said after attending an event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How can we implement it so that everyone can accept it, and people won’t find it too much of a disruption, so the scheme can run smoothly -- these are all things we need to think about."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said a six-month grace period for restaurants to continue giving out single-use plastic utensils should be long enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From April 22, eateries had to switch to alternative utensils, but they can still give out plastic containers for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said those who had yet to switch had told officials they were trying to clear their plastic stock, or were waiting for the alternatives to arrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials would visit smaller eateries in the coming months to see if they need any help.

    Jeremiah Manele named as new Solomon Islands PM

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The new Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands steps out of Parliament House to meet the press. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751503_1_L_20240502160742.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Solomon Islands lawmakers selected Jeremiah Manele as their new prime minister on Thursday, elevating the former foreign minister who had pledged to continue the Pacific Island nation's international policy that drew it closer to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Governor General Sir David Vunagi announced outside parliament house that Manele won 31 votes to opposition leader Matthew Wales' 18 votes in the 50-seat parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A national election last month saw incumbent Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's government lose half of its seats but failed to deliver a majority to any political party. The government and opposition parties lobbied intensively for weeks to win support from independents ahead of the vote for prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police boosted security in the capital Honiara as newly elected lawmakers arrived at parliament on Thursday to vote in a secret ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election was closely watched by China, the US and neighbouring Australia because of the potential impact on regional security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he looked forward to working closely with Manele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australia and Solomon Islands are close friends and our futures are connected," he wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's embassy said in a Facebook post it looked forward to working with Manele to develop "China-Solomon Islands relations". (Reuters)

Consumer Council criticised over privacy breach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung on Thursday criticised the Consumer Council over a data breach last year, saying the watchdog contravened the Personal Data Ordinance with its deficiencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An attack by hackers resulted in the leak of personal data on more than 450 individuals, including staff members and people who filed complaints with the council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung's office said the council started allowing staff to connect to its server using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when work-from-home arrangements were introduced during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the council failed to enable multi-factor authentication for the remote access and a hacker group obtained the credentials of a user account before deploying ransomware in the council's servers and endpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chung said the council had not taken all practicable steps to protect personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protection given by this multi-factor authentication would be enhanced to over 99 percent if this feature is enabled," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung added that two weeks passed before the council realised there had been a breach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cybersecurity solution was supposed to send an email alert to the council once it detected any cybersecurity attack. However, in this case, after the incident the council discovered that the cybersecurity solution was not properly configured," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That was why even though it detected the attack in question, it did not send any email alert to the council for this particular incident, and that was why the council only discovered the cyberattack on September 20 [last year]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has served an enforcement notice on the council and has ordered it to submit proof within two months that it has adopted improvement measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the council said it attaches great importance to cybersecurity and has adopted various measures since the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The measures include] enabling multi-factor authentication for remote data access via VPN, conducting a comprehensive review of the cybersecurity solutions' functions and appropriate settings, and further strengthening internal training to enhance staff's awareness and behaviour on cybersecurity," it said in a statement.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Thursday urged the government to improve the quality of public housing as supply catches up with demand.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation said it expects the average waiting time for a public flat to fall from the current 5.8 years to 4.6 years by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s vice president, Ryan Ip, said 35,000 units are expected to be completed each year in the next five years, exceeding the government's long-term target of 30,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The total completion of public housing in the next 10 years, no matter which scenarios, it can fulfil the government's own targets. So, with this overall background, then we can sort of move from quantity to the quality side," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, first of all, we advocate for a steadily increasing of the size of housing units of public housing in the next five to 10 years.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for private housing, Ip said the supply will remain stable even though the government saw a record six failed land tenders last year.

    Shoppers delight amid weak yen

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A weak yen spells good news for Hong Kong holidaymakers in Japan but experts say that could hurt inbound tourism. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751467_1_L_20240502122135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the ongoing slump in the yen which sank to a new 34-year low earlier this week, Japan has seen an influx of Hongkongers taking advantage of the weaker currency and snapping up everything from designer goods to daily necessities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the yen fell to 160 to the US dollar before recovering. The Japanese currency was down some 10 percent since the start of the year and 30 percent from three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Hong Kong travellers have been visiting Japan since the end of the pandemic, and the trend is not about to end anytime soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The yen is very cheap right now, so it’s a great time to go shopping here,” said Maggie Kwong, a Hong Kong banking professional who went to Tokyo for her second trip to Japan this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, I went to buy a pair of running shoes... Usually the shoes would cost around HK$1,000, but I was able to buy it for just under HK$500 for the same pair of shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So definitely, the fact that the yen has weakened has given me more motivation to come visit Japan and to spend more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, told RTHK that the number of Hongkongers travelling to Japan was up 20 percent in both March and April compared with a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said a weaker yen does not necessarily mean cheaper tours, citing higher demand not only from Hong Kong but also around the world, especially North America, with a record three million foreign holidaymakers in Japan in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huen also said Japanese people who opted to travel domestically instead of overseas added to demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, he said Hongkongers find prices to be attractive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A ramen index also suggested that a ramen in Japan now costs about HK$50, versus the about HK$120 to HK$150 in Central in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been speculation that Tokyo has intervened to prop up the currency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An actual intervention would be authorities directly selling US dollars and buying the yen in the foreign exchange markets to support the yen, but the impact from such an intervention will be rather short-lived because the foreign exchange reserves that the Japanese government holds are limited,” Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will not change the yen’s weakness in the long term, before the US Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates later this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the yen to remain at about 150 to 160 against the greenback for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This will give travellers from Hong Kong an advantage to visit Japan, but it will make the Hong Kong inbound tourism recovery even slower due to the linked exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar,” Cheung noted.

'Labour Day tourist figures as expected'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751468_1_L_20240502113052.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, on Thursday said tourist figures for the first day of the mainland's Golden Week holiday were in line with expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said arrivals in the SAR exceeded 460,000 on May 1, including around 180,000 from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some tourists complained on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu that bad weather marred a fireworks show over Victoria Harbour on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui told an RTHK programme that he thinks the visitor numbers would have been even higher if the weather had been better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, some people joked that they didn't just see the fireworks but smoke as well. I believe this is to do with the weather. But I think visitors who came to Hong Kong were generally satisfied. It's very common to say a few words on social media platforms," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing his views, wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said items such as jewellery and cosmetics were popular among tourists on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiu added that he hopes the government will continue to improve publicity for mega events and support airlines to beef up their flight capacity.

    Death toll from Guangdong road collapse rises to 48

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a highway collapse in Guangdong province increased to 48 on Thursday, as President Xi Jinping called for the utmost efforts to save lives and eliminate dangers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Heavy rains caused a stretch of road running from Meizhou city towards Dabu county to cave in at around 2.10am on Wednesday, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vehicles careened into the nearly 18-metre-long gash in the tarmac and plummeted down the steep slope below. The highway collapse had trapped over 20 vehicles, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media called the road collapse a "natural geological disaster" caused by the "impact of persistent heavy rain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 500 people have been dispatched to help with the rescue operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported that Xi is highly concerned about the incident and gave important instructions on the rescue and relief work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said efforts should be made to repair the damaged roads and restore traffic order as soon as possible, and that all regions and relevant departments must strengthen monitoring and early warning, and ensure the safety of people's lives and property as well as overall social stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, massive downpours in a different part of the province sparked floods that claimed four lives and forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a tornado killed five people when it ripped through Guangzhou last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With rainfall expected to intensify throughout May, the government has warned of possible further disasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Multiparty discussions and evaluations indicate that strong convection and heavy precipitation may increase in China in May," Xinhua cited the emergency management ministry as saying. (Agencies)

    HKMA again leaves key interest rate unchanged

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday again kept its key interest rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, saying “high rates may last for some time”.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move by the city’s de facto central bank came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve which earlier kept its target rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, citing “hotter-than-expected” price pressures as well as growth reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, HKMA said the Fed “has not yet gained enough confidence about the US inflation trajectory to start cutting interest rates”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The high interest rate environment may last for some time,” it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said the city’s financial and monetary markets are operating in a smooth and orderly manner, but warned that the interbank offered rate (Hibor) may remain high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC took the lead among the city's banks in leaving its prime lending rate unchanged at 5.875 percent, while keeping interest rates on Hong Kong dollar savings accounts steady.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the one-month Hibor rate, which is used to price the majority of local mortgages, slightly rose to 4.34 percent, a three-week high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-month Hibor rate, which reflects banks’ funding costs, also rose slightly to a three-week high, at 4.58 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA and the Fed have kept their key lending rates unchanged since last July, after increasing them 11 times since March 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics crushed the Miami Heat 118-84 to complete an emphatic 4-1 series victory Wednesday and book their place in the second round of the NBA playoffs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The postseason top seeds – upset by Miami in last year's Eastern Conference finals – avenged that loss in spectacular fashion with a one-sided wire-to-wire rout at the TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored 25 points apiece to lead Boston, who barely noticed the absence of the injured Kristaps Porzingis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics threw down the gauntlet in the first quarter, racking up a whopping 41 points to open up a commanding 18-point advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They extended that lead to 22 points by half-time, and kept up the pressure in the third quarter to lead 98-66 heading into the final frame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla could afford to rest his frontline players for the fourth with the game effectively won against an injury-hit Miami team missing Jimmy Butler and Jaime Jaquez Jr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston will now face either the fourth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers or fifth seeds Orlando in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. Cleveland lead that series 3-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics advance into the next series brimming with confidence after ruthlessly taking care of eighth-seeded Miami in five games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White's 25-point haul included five three-pointers while Jayson Tatum added 16 points including 12 rebounds with three assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam Hauser added 17 points off the bench while Jrue Holiday also cracked double figures with 10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bam Adebayo led Miami's scoring with 23 points, with Tyler Herro finishing with 15 and Caleb Martin 10. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten cricket pitches have completed their journey up the East Coast of the United States from Florida to New York state and are being installed in a new stadium built for next month's T20 World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "drop in pitches" have been prepared in Florida since December and were recently transported by 20 trailer trucks to the venue in Long Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surfaces, which will soon be used for games including the highly-anticipated clash between cricket giants India and Pakistan, were developed by Australian Damian Hough, curator of the Adelaide Oval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winter conditions in New York meant that the grass needed to be grown in the warmer climate of Florida before being transported and installed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hough said the journey from the base in Boynton Beach, Florida, to Nassau County in New York state, took over 24 hours, with regular stops for checks and hydration of the grass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The temporary 34,000 capacity stadium at Eisenhower Park has already been built with stands and hospitality areas already in place and the outfield has been put in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hough said the surface is likely to be typical of the kind used for T20 matches, where fans expect to see big shots from the batsmen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our ambition is to produce pitches along the lines where they're good quality pitches, minimal spin, minimal seam and ball coming onto the bat and let the players play the shot," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first World Cup game at the venue will feature Sri Lanka v South Africa on June 3 but organisers are planning some test events before then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the material for the stands has been taken from Formula One motor racing and will be dismantled after the end of the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the international standard playing surface will remain in place with the possibility of it being used for local cricket. (AFP)

    MLB suspensions after Brewers-Rays brawl

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Milwaukee pitchers Abner Uribe and Freddy Peralta and Brewers manager Pat Murphy were suspended along with Tampa Bay outfielder Jose Siri by Major League Baseball Wednesday for their roles in a brawl.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uribe was suspended for six games and Peralta for five, with both players launching an appeal to shorten the punishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Rays said Siri would appeal his three-game suspension while Murphy served the first game of his two-game ban on Wednesday, when the Brewers beat the Rays 7-1 in Milwaukee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were ejected from the Brewers' 8-2 victory over the Rays on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With one out in the sixth inning, an errant fastball from Peralta hit Siri – who had homered earlier – in the left thigh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That led to Peralta, and an incensed Murphy being ejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Siri came to the plate in the eighth he hit a ground ball that was tossed to pitcher Abner Uribe covering first base – where the two traded swings that brought players racing from both dugouts. Siri and Uribe were ejected after order was restored.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could tell that something was being said," plate umpire Chris Guccione said. "We tried to get in there to break them up, but it happened so fast that it blew up." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ronnie O'Sullivan's bid to capture a record eighth world snooker title came crashing down on Wednesday when he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Stuart Bingham.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bingham, the 2015 champion, came through 13-10 and will face Welsh qualifier Jak Jones for a place in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jones stunned former champion Judd Trump 13-9 in his quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a little cry in my dressing room, I was fearing the worst," said Bingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know how I've held myself together."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bingham, who has lost his place in the world's top 16, pulled away from an increasingly agitated O'Sullivan, reeling off the final three frames to seal a nerve-jangling win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm actually really happy to be honest, it's just the way it goes sometimes," O'Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like I'm actually getting through the ball, which is more important to me at this stage. It's been a worrying couple of years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not the win I'd have liked to have had, but that's snooker. That's the way it goes. Good luck to Stuart." (AFP)

    Advantage Dortmund over PSG in Champions League

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Niclas Fuellkrug gave Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League semi-final first leg on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seeking a return to the final for the first time since 2013, the 1997 winners were dogged and determined, outmuscling their heavily favoured opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug, playing in his first Champions League season at the age of 31, collected a lofted pass from centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck in the 36th minute and blasted a low shot into the left corner of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG, led by Kylian Mbappe, hit the post twice in quick succession early in the second-half but could not break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dortmund, who had already lost and drawn against PSG this season in the group stage, can continue to dream of a return to Wembley 11 years after their last Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the setback, however, PSG will remain confident of overturning the deficit at home next week against a side they thoroughly outclassed at their home venue in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dortmund manager Edin Terzic said pre-match PSG were "built to win the Champions League" since the Qatari takeover a decade ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nowhere was the contrast between the two clubs greater than PSG's global superstar Mbappe, playing in his last season for his hometown club, and journeyman Dortmund striker Fuellkrug, who was playing second-division football this time two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory, along with Tuesday's 2-2 draw between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the other semi-final, guarantees Germany rather than England or France an extra Champions League place for next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That has already secured Dortmund's place in the competition next season (AFP)

    Alcaraz crashes, Sinner hobbles out of Madrid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz exits the Madrid Open at the hands of Andrey Rublev. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751439_1_L_20240502080854.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz saw his title defence and 14-match winning streak in Madrid come to an end at the hands of Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals on Wednesday while top-seeded Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament citing a right hip injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rublev upset home favourite Alcaraz 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz missed the clay-court tournaments in Monte Carlo and Barcelona last month due to a forearm injury and needed a third-set tiebreak to squeeze past last year's finalist Jan-Lennard Struff in the fourth round on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He couldn't hold off an inspired Rublev though, his quest to become the first man to win three consecutive titles in Madrid coming to a crashing halt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner was due to face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals on Thursday but revealed he has been battling through a hip issue this week in the Spanish capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My hip has been bothering me this week and has slowly been getting more painful. Taking the advice from the doctors we decided it's best to not play further and make it worse," wrote Sinner in a statement on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner is due to play on home ground at the Italian Open in Rome next week before heading for an assault on the French Open, the season's second major, which starts in Paris on May 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elena Rybakina battled back from 2-5 down in the deciding set and saved two match points to overcome Yulia Putintseva 4-6, 7-6 [7/4], 7-5 and reach the semi-finals of the WTA event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A late-match collapse from Putintseva, who smashed her racquet and left it on court after the match, helped Rybakina advance to her sixth semi-final of the season, where she will face defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sabalenka picked up a 10th consecutive victory in Madrid with a 6-1, 6-4 win against 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka is 5-3 lifetime against Rybakina but lost three of their last four meetings, most recently in the Brisbane final in January. Their Madrid semi-final will be their first encounter on clay. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Wednesday, concluding a volatile session after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates flat and signaled rate hikes were not probable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Major equities had shot higher after Fed Chair Jerome Powell called further rate hikes unlikely, but those gains largely faded in the final moments of the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at 37,903, up 0.2 percent from Tuesday, but down almost 450 points from its session peak.

Bogota cuts ties with Israel over 'genocide' in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on Wednesday his country will sever diplomatic ties with Israel, whose leader he described as "genocidal" over its war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow (Thursday) diplomatic relations with the state of Israel will be severed... for having a genocidal president," Petro, a harsh critic of the war against Hamas, told a May Day rally in Bogota, referring to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's foreign minister on Wednesday said Petro's decision to cut diplomatic ties amounted to handing a "reward" to Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Petro has taken a critical stance on the Gaza assault that followed an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 -- which resulted in the deaths of some 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In October, just days after the start of the war, Israel said it was "halting security exports" to Colombia after Petro accused Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of using language about the people of Gaza similar to what the "Nazis said of the Jews."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel accused Petro of "expressing support for the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists, fueling anti-Semitism," and summoned Colombia's ambassador.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, one of the main providers of arms to Colombia's military, then said it was "halting security exports" to the South American country as the diplomatic feud escalated. (AFP)

    New flu trend detection model for better vaccines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CUHK Faculty of Medicine's research team developed a computational model to forest viral genetic evolution. Photo: CUHK Faculty of Medicine" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751406_1_L_20240502004550.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese University researcher said a new computing model could help the authorities make better choices in selecting the strain of flu they vaccinate people against.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health officials have to choose which vaccine to order ahead of each flu season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Wang, who developed the new model, known as beth-1, with colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine, said it could predict how the virus would change in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the model would give authorities early warnings of emerging virus variants, particularly for the H3N2 virus, the H1N1 virus and the influenza B virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This information is particularly important for the WHO (World Health Organisation) because each year or each season, the next season's influenza vaccine strain should be determined earlier, that is almost nine to 12 months ahead of the target season. A prediction model can provide critical information to inform the decision makers of the optimal vaccine strain to select," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For pharmaceutical companies, the forecasting model is also very useful because the manufacturing of the influenza vaccine has a really compact timeline. So earlier prediction can give more time and the buffer for the manufacturers to prepare the vaccine development and manufacturing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that their research team has already been working closely with institutions in the mainland to conduct animal experiments for manufacturing more effective vaccines using the beth-1 model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did the prospective validation using mice model. That is, we predict the next season, the future season's representative viral strain, and then use this strain to make the vaccine to immunize the mice, and we also immunize another group of mice using the current vaccines," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And after a few months, when the target season comes, we collect the circulating viruses from the Prince of Wales Hospital, and then use this circulating virus to challenge the immunized mice, and compare how strongly antibody response in these two groups of mice. The outcome is that our model-predicted strain generates significantly higher, or non-inferior neutralization titer, antibody response against the circulating viruses."

 Turkish police on Wednesday fired tear gas and rubber bullets and detained more than 200 protesters after authorities banned May 1 rallies at Istanbul's historic Taksim Square.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 police were deployed across Istanbul, blocking even small sidestreets with metal barriers in an attempt to prevent protesters gathering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police clashed with demonstrators near city hall in the Sarachane district, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to stop protesters breaching barricades, AFP reporters said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "210 people were detained in Istanbul after failure to heed our warnings and attempting to walk to the Taksim Square and attack our police officers on May 1 Labour and Solidarity Day," Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tall metal barriers were put up around the square, where authorities have banned rallies since 2013, when it was the focus of demonstrations against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have demonstrated our will to celebrate May Day at Taksim Square. We have legal grounds," Arzu Cerkezoglu, secretary general of the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey (DISK) told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taksim is an important symbol for us. Taksim means May Day, Taksim means labour," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, Turkey's top constitutional court ruled that the closure of Taksim Square for protests was a violation of rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The square was a rallying ground for May Day celebrations until 1977, when at least 34 people were killed during demonstrations. Authorities opened it up again in 2010, but it was shut again after the 2013 protests. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Wednesday said a trial has shown that there are still many problems with the government's long-delayed waste charging programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pay-as-you-throw scheme was tested at 14 locations from last month, covering homes, shops and restaurants, but only about half of the households participated by using designated bags to dispose of trash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk said a working group had been meeting every week to discuss the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial observations, there are many problems. We think that if we introduce the waste charging scheme, we must have a consensus and support from Hong Kong people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's because this policy directly affects the seven million people in Hong Kong. There must be favourable conditions in various areas in order to roll the scheme out smoothly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials had earlier said it remained to be seen whether a full rollout would go ahead on August 1 as planned.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said an 8pm pyrotechnic display over Victoria Harbour will go ahead as planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show had been in doubt because of inclement weather, but the board says forecasts show it's fine to go ahead, warning people attending to bring rain gear and check the conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's good news for tourists in town for the Labour Day holiday who had been anxiously checking the weather ahead of the fireworks show, which is the first in a series planned to mark holidays and festivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who is making a three-day trip from Zhejiang province, said it is her first time in Hong Kong and she really wants to see the fireworks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really want to see it...I think the scene will be fascinating. I've watched similar shows on the mainland, but I think that may be different in Hong Kong," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some mainland tourists said they would not be staying overnight because of the high prices for hotels during the holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will go back to Shenzhen at night, but we may come again on Friday. The price of a hotel room in Shenzhen is just a third of that in Hong Kong. That's a huge difference," a tourist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said as of 4pm, there were about 237,000 tourist arrivals, and that includes nearly 140,000 mainland tourists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 24 people died after part of a highway collapsed due to heavy rains in Guangdong province on Wednesday, state media said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency said that a stretch of road between Meizhou city and Dabu county caved in at around 2.10am. The incident caused 20 vehicles to become trapped and involved a total of 54 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of 3pm, "24 people have been confirmed dead, and 30 are receiving all-out emergency care in hospital", Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news agency also said the incident did not involve any large vehicles or vehicles transporting hazardous chemicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An aerial photograph published by broadcaster CCTV showed wrecked vehicles lying in a deep muddy pit where the highway once ran, while dozens of emergency vehicles and cranes congregated along the intact section of the road, which bisects a steep, wooded slope. It reported that a nearly 18-metre stretch of road had fallen away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have dispatched around 500 people to the site to help with the rescue operation. They are drawn from departments handling public security, emergency response, firefighting and mining rescue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident is the latest in a string of disasters attributed to extreme weather events in Guangdong in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Massive downpours last month sparked floods in a different part of the province that claimed the lives of four people and forced the evacuation of over 100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a swirling tornado killed five people when it ripped through Guangzhou last week. (AFP)

    Hong Kong Observatory verifying reports of hail

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Posts from several social media platforms said that hail was falling in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory is verifying social media posts which apparently showed hail falling in Hong Kong as the city was hit with storms overnight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During an amber warning issued at about 9.30pm on Tuesday, posts from several social media platforms reported that hail was falling in Yuen Long. One video on Instagram showed residents there running for cover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said it is verifying the social media posts, and noted that there were reports of hail fall from Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last year, there were also hail reports in March and April,” Betty Mak, a scientific officer at the Observatory, told RTHK, noting that there is nothing unusual for it to hail this time of year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We’ll consider all the data and observations including the stability of the atmosphere and analysis of radar images and hail reports from nearby areas or locally to assess."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Members of the public should consider bringing rain gear when going out,” Mak added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster also said lightning struck the east of the territory more than 6,400 times between 10pm and 10am. “Violent gusts” of over 100km per hour were also recorded in Cheung Chau early on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a concert that was being held in Central was forced to stop midway when the amber signal came into effect on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And several flights were affected by the weather, with some being delayed or rerouted to land in other airports in the Pearl River Delta area.

    'More weight on GDP growth needed for minimum wage'

'More weight on GDP growth needed for minimum wage'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751345_1_L_20240501111023.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Wednesday said authorities should give more weight to the growth of the SAR's economy in a new formula for calculating the minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Executive Council on Tuesday approved recommendations to review the minimum wage every year instead of every two years, and under the new mechanism, the minimum wage would not be reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new formula will take into account the consumer price index and 20 percent of the difference between the previous year’s GDP figure and economic growth in the past decade, with a cap of one percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTU chairman Kingsley Wong welcomed the change, but he said the hourly minimum wage would only increase by about HK$1 every year under the new mechanism, which is not ideal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Grassroots workers should also be able to share the results of economic prosperity. It's too low to only include [20 percent of the GDP growth difference]. This is what the mechanism is short of," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that employers, employees, officials and scholars should review the mechanism, for example, in every five years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said calculations should include 30 percent of the GDP growth difference instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said the catering sector will not see a huge increase in operating costs because of the new mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the labour shortage situation, the hourly wage for the catering sector is a lot higher than the minimum wage... For temporary positions, restaurants mostly have to pay workers at least HK$50 to HK$60 per hour, and some Chinese restaurants even pay their frontline staff HK$80 or more," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, labour secretary Chris Sun brushed aside concerns that the new mechanism would undermine Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, he said the government has considered many factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to ensure that the wage won't be too low, while minimising the loss of low-paid jobs. We also have to consider the competitiveness of the city at the same time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can't see how the modified minimum wage mechanism would affect the competitiveness of Hong Kong and the business sector," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, meanwhile, said on social media that the changes could protect grassroots workers. He expressed the hope that officials could work with various sectors to build a "reasonable, fair and safe" environment for workers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, on Wednesday conducted maiden sea trials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fujian, the most advanced aircraft carrier yet, left Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard at about 8am to conduct trials to test the reliability and stability of its propulsion and electrical systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First shown to the public in June 2022, the Fujian was entirely designed and built domestically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft carrier is larger and technologically more advanced than the Shandong, commissioned in 2019, and the Liaoning, which China bought second-hand from Ukraine and refitted domestically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since its launch in June 2022, the Fujian has completed its mooring trials, outfitting work and equipment adjustments. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751343_1_L_20240501105700.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nation's human rights chief has voiced concern over heavy-handed steps to remove protesters from university campuses in the United States where pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been taking place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statement comes as dozens of helmeted police on Tuesday night marched onto Columbia University in New York City – the epicentre of the student protests – and began evicting a building that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian student protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to society – particularly when there is sharp disagreement on major issues,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It continued by saying that many of the protests have been held without incident and that at a number of locations, they have been dispersed or dismantled by security forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of students have been arrested, while others face charges or academic sanctions, the statement said, adding that enforcement actions by universities or law enforcement to restrict such expression "need to be carefully scrutinised".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement continued by quoting Türk as saying: “I am concerned that some of [the] law enforcement actions across a series of universities appear disproportionate in their impacts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations – the most sweeping and prolonged unrest to rock US college campuses since the Vietnam war protests of the 1960s and 70s – have posed a challenge to university administrators trying to balance free speech rights with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unrest has swept through US higher education institutions like wildfire, with many student protesters erecting tent encampments on campuses from coast to coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage of police in riot gear summoned at various colleges has been viewed around the world. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changpeng Zhao, the former chief executive of Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Once considered the most powerful crypto industry figure, Zhao, known as "CZ," is the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle was significantly shorter than the three years sought by prosecutors, and below the maximum one and a half years recommended under federal guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also much lighter than the 25 years behind bars that Sam Bankman-Fried received in March for stealing US$8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, prosecutors cheered the outcome of what had been a years-long investigation into Binance and Zhao, a billionaire who had been living beyond US reach in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an epic day,” US Attorney Tessa Gorman told reporters outside the courthouse. “Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before handing down the sentence, Jones faulted Zhao for making Binance's growth and profitability a higher priority than complying with US laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you failed at that opportunity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhao, 47, did not visibly react upon hearing his sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'Crime pays' is the message sent today," Dennis Kelleher, head of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in an email, noting Zhao will still get to keep his vast wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors said Binance employed a "Wild West" model that welcomed criminals, and did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm sorry," Zhao told the judge before being sentenced. (Reuters)

    Georgia police break up 'foreign agents' law protest

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police use water cannon to disperse protesters in Tbilisi. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751328_1_L_20240501090726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgian security forces used water cannon, tear gas and stun grenades against protesters outside parliament late on Tuesday, sharply escalating a crackdown after lawmakers debated a "foreign agents" bill which is viewed by the opposition and Western nations as authoritarian and Russian-inspired.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses said they saw some police officers physically attack protesters, who threw eggs and bottles at them, before using tear gas, water cannon and stun grenades to force demonstrators from the area outside the parliament building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Levan Khabeishvili, the leader of Georgia's largest opposition party, the United National Movement, posted a picture on X with his face bloodied and sporting a black eye. A party official said Khabeishvili was beaten by police after disappearing from central Tbilisi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After being dispersed from parliament, around two thousand protesters continued to block Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue, barricading it with cafe tables and rubbish bins. Some shouted "Slaves" and "Russians" at police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, riot police used pepper spray and batons to clear some protesters who were trying to prevent lawmakers from leaving the back entrance of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili,  whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said in a post on X the crackdown had been "totally unwarranted, unprovoked and out of proportion," and that the protests had been peaceful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill has heightened divisions in the southern Caucasus country, setting the ruling Georgian Dream party against a protest movement backed by opposition groups, civil society, celebrities and the figurehead president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, which is controlled by the Georgian Dream and its allies, is likely to approve the bill, which must pass two more readings before becoming law. Lawmakers ended Tuesday's session without a vote and the debate will resume on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, a government-organised rally in support of the bill was attended by tens of thousands of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At that rally, former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who founded Georgian Dream, told attendees that a "global party of war" had hijacked the EU and Nato and that it was bent on using those institutions to undermine Georgian sovereignty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as "foreign agents". Georgian critics have labelled the bill "the Russian law", comparing it to Moscow's "foreign agent" legislation, which has been used to crack down on dissent there. (Reuters)

    Vinicius on the spot to keep Real-Bayern tie level

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vinicius Jr celebrates after slotting home his winning penalty. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751327_1_L_20240501085033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr scored twice, including a late penalty, to snatch a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich in an entertaining Champions League semi-final, first leg on Tuesday, leaving the tie wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Brazilian, who put Real in front after 24 minutes, has now scored in the semi-finals for a third successive season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bayern, with only the Champions League title left to fight for, had scored twice in four minutes early in the second half through a Leroy Sane strike and Harry Kane penalty to turn the game around before Vinicius' spot kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always want to win but we know that this competition is like that, you can't give away balls because teams score the chances they have," Vinicius Jr said. "We have to keep our heads calm, rest until next week and we know that we and the fans are going to leave everything at the Santiago Bernabeu to qualify."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now it's time for a magical night at home to win and secure our place in the final," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Facing each other for a record eighth time at this stage of the competition, it was Bayern who got off to a strong start, racking up half a dozen attempts on goal by the 15th minute with Sane and Kane coming close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real needed only one chance to score though, stunning the home crowd against the run of play when Kroos sliced open the Bayern defence with a through ball and Vinicius Jr chased it down to beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kroos almost added another himself in the 51st but his curled shot was palmed wide by Neuer. Instead, it was Bayern who scored two minutes later with a solo effort and shot from Sane that eluded goalkeeper Andriy Lunin for a deserved equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their comeback was complete in the 57th when Jamal Musiala was brought down in the area by Lucas Vazquez and Kane sent Lunin the wrong way from the spot to put the home side ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real, chasing a 15th European Cup, levelled in the 83rd with Vinicius' penalty, after Rodrygo was felled by a clumsy challenge from Kim Min-jae, to set up a mouth-watering return leg in Madrid next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything we're fighting for is in this competition," said Kane. "We've just got to find a way to get it done. Real Madrid away is going to be tough but we've got to go there with full belief and go for the win."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners will face either Borussia Dortmund or Paris St Germain, who meet in the second semi-final on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Tuesday following disappointing economic data as US Treasury yields pushed higher ahead of a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since July 2022, missing expectations amid rising anxiety over the jobs market and future financial conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts also cited an uptick in US Treasury yields following data showing a jump in US employee compensation costs in the first quarter. The rise came as the Fed kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting.

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 percent to 37,815.

  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent to 5,035, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 2.0 percent to 15,657. (AFP)

    Alcaraz holds off Struff to reach Madrid quarter-final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz of Spain is in action during the 2024 ATP Tour Madrid Open tennis tournament at Caja Magica in Madrid, Spain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751305_1_L_20240501024942.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Second seed Carlos Alcaraz extended his Madrid Open winning streak to a record-equalling 14 with a hard-fought victory over familiar foe Jan-Lennard Struff to move into the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of last year's final at the Caja Magica, Alcaraz snapped Struff's six-match winning streak with a 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/4) result to squeeze through to a last-eight clash with seventh seed Andrey Rublev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Jannik Sinner has been dealing with a hip problem but managed to overcome Karen Khachanov 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 to reach his fourth Masters 1000 quarter-final in as many events this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, who missed Monte Carlo and Barcelona with a forearm injury, saved eight out of 10 break points and saw four match points come and go before he completed the two-hour 52-minute win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How much I've missed this! Quarters next," wrote the former world number one on the camera lens after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, who is now 24-0 on Spanish clay since the start of the 2022 season, is bidding to become the first player to win three consecutive Madrid titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After blowing a 2-0 lead in the second set, Alcaraz opened up a 3-1 advantage in the tiebreak, only to lose the next five points and go on to surrender the set to Struff, who came into the tournament on the back of a maiden ATP title run in Munich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break of serve in the fourth game of the decider gave Alcaraz the score cushion he needed but the two-time Grand Slam champion was broken while serving for the victory from 40-0 up at 5-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Struff saved four match points and the contest fittingly went to a deciding tiebreak. Alcaraz let a 3-0 lead slip, but he got his hands on more match points by landing an inch-perfect lob and he closed on his fifth opportunity of the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This match reminds me of last year's. It was a great fight," said Alcaraz after matching Rafael Nadal's record winning streak in Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult for me to deal with my emotions, to handle difficult moments. Serving for the match, it was really difficult for me to get broken after being 40-0 up, but I'm really happy that at the end it didn't affect me and my mentality and I kept fighting." (AFP)

    Israel PM warns of Rafah attack 'with or without' deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Palestinian woman stands at the entrance of a tent in an area housing displaced people in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751299_1_L_20240501001655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Tuesday to launch a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip's far-southern city of Rafah "with or without" a truce deal being agreed with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hawkish premier issued the warning despite strong concerns raised by top ally Washington and hours before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to arrive in Israel on his latest Middle East crisis tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu promised "total victory" and said stopping the war "before achieving all of its goals is out of the question".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal," he told families of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu's comments came as Hamas was weighing the latest plan for a truce proposed in Cairo talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators that had raised cautious hopes for an end to the fighting after nearly seven months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian militant group said it was considering a plan for a 40-day ceasefire and the exchange of scores of hostages for larger numbers of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington has heightened pressure on all sides to reach a ceasefire - a message pushed by Blinken, who was on his seventh regional tour since the war broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As diplomacy continued, Israel kept up its bombardment that has flattened swathes of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An AFP correspondent reported air strikes on Gaza City, Khan Yunis and Rafah, while Israel said "fighter jets struck a number of terror targets in central Gaza".
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday evening that hail could affect the SAR after it was reported in the Pearl River Delta.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hail was reported in Macau as authorities there called on residents to stay indoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Hong Kong, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 9:30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster called on people to be alert and seek safe shelter, as violent gusts reaching 110 kilometres per hour affect the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department called on employers to avoid assigning workers to carry out electrical work, and protect the safety of those engaged in such tasks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by the rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent electric shock as the air would be more humid," said a spokesperson from the department.

    Negative equity cases at their highest in two decades

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.

    'New changes to minimum wage fair for businesses'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association says the new way of calculating the minimum wage is fair for businesses. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751243_1_L_20240430180505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker and a representative of small and medium-sized firms on Tuesday welcomed the new way of calculating Hong Kong's minimum wage, which now takes into account the city's economic development and consumer prices.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Danny Lau, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the shake-up is fair for business operators and workers, but it is unreasonable there is no chance of the minimum wage being reduced if times get tough for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing that we worry is you can only [increase it], you cannot decrease the minimum wage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new changes, the minimum wage would not be reduced but frozen even if the formula produces a negative number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if it would put pressure on bosses in small and medium-sized firms when the economy is not doing well, Priscilla Wong, who chairs the Minimum Wage Commission, said a balance needs to be struck.

  “These are the people with the lowest ability to bargain, the least bargaining power. And as a society, we are hoping that their wages do not go through vertically down and go down to the point that we lose our wage floor,” she told a media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing welcomed the new mechanism, but he told RTHK the administration should give greater weight to GDP in the calculations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the proportion that [accounts for] the growth in GDP can be more. This means if we have a large growth of the GDP and then we can have an increase in minimum wages level, that's very important because it allows our grassroots workers to share the fruit of economic development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Party's catering sector lawmaker, Tommy Cheung, earlier said the minimum wage could hurt the SAR's competitiveness, calling on authorities to scrap it altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But labour minister Chris Sun dismissed the suggestion, saying the new changes ensure there is room for low-paid workers to maintain their purchasing power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design of the formula is to make sure that while we remain competitive, we have to also take care of the needs of those at the very low level. We're just talking about a small number of workers. And as a society, we should help them to make sure that at the very low level, we have enough room for them to be able to earn.”

 The China Manned Space Agency has declared the Shenzhou-17 mission a complete success as its three crew members returned to Earth on Tuesday afternoon after their six-month mission in space.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agency said astronauts Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin were in good health conditions as they emerged from the spacecraft's return capsule that touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Hongbo, commander of the Shenzhou-17 mission and the first to step out of the capsule, thanked everyone for their support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel so proud of my country," he said. "Every time the spacecraft flew over the motherland, I always searched for my homeland with a sense of longing and pride."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Shengjie described it as a dream come true, and said he can't wait for the next mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me, the six-month mission is a learning journey for me, and also a journey for exploration. I learned a lot; there is a vast universe and there's no end for me to continue to explore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Tuesday, the Shenzhou-17 separated from the country's space station combination and started its journey back to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the separation, the Shenzhou-17 crew – with the assistance of the ground staff – completed various tasks such as setting the status of the space station combination and carried out handover work with the Shenzhou-18 crew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Hongbo has now accumulated a total of 279 days in space over the course of two missions, Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-17, setting a new record for the longest spaceflight by a Chinese astronaut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhou-17 crew were launched to the Tiangong space station last October. The Shenzhou-18 was launched last week. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)
