<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday advised people to opt for boiled tap water instead of bottled water.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During hot summer days, people tend to lose water more easily, and staying hydrated becomes crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consumer watchdog tested 30 bottled water brands, including mineral water and distilled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings revealed that tap water contained a higher mineral content than mineralised purified water and distilled water with added minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also discovered that the price of tap water was around 2,700 times lower than that of bottled water, as a litre of tap water costs around $0.00262 while distilled and purified drinking water costs HK$7.02 per litre on average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said tap water is a more eco-friendly and affordable option for consumers, compared to bottled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously our tap water, after you boiled it, it is much more economical, much more friendly, especially from an environmental protection point of view. Every bottle when you produce, you know, you're polluting the environment. Every bottle that you consumed, you are creating harm to the current environment as well as the next generation,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that all bottled water it tested passed its safety tests.

    Indoor playhouses urged to ensure facilities are safe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Consumer Council says indoor playhouse operators should ensure their terms and conditions are clearly stated. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761629_1_20240715115159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The consumer watchdog on Monday called on indoor playhouse operators to ensure the design and layout of their facilities are safe, and to clearly list out terms and conditions to avoid disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council said it had received a complaint about a child suffering a forearm dislocation and a wrist fracture from a fall while navigating a rope tunnel at a playhouse, and that a request for a refund and compensation was initially met with "ambiguous responses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The venue involved only proposed compensation of HK$3,000 after the watchdog stepped in, but the child's parent had yet to accept the offer and was considering legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The council would like to remind the industry that indoor playhouses must follow stringent safety standards in terms of game design and venue layout. They should also properly assess and mitigate any safety risks and provide sufficient safety measures to participants to ensure a positive experience for both parents and children," the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complaints included a toddler playgroup centre providing unclear terms and conditions to use complimentary playtime offered alongside a course enrolment, and another members-only indoor playhouse resetting a customer's account balance to zero without prior notice upon the expiry of the one-year membership period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terms and conditions of use should be clearly stated, and flexible pricing policies are recommended to manage expectations and minimise disputes between traders and users," the watchdog said.

    China's economy slows in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by 5 percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to a 2 percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery. (Agencies)

    Police meet with retail trade to address theft
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police meet with retail trade to address theft" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761617_1_20240715115137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they recently met with some 40 retail industry representatives to work on ways to prevent theft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the force recorded around 37,000 cases of theft between January and May this year, which represented a three percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them, there were 3,678 cases of shoplifting, a 12 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities arrested 1,750 people in total, of which around 150 of them were caught on suspicion of making repeated attempts at shoplifting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was suspected to have shoplifted five times during the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most common age group to commit shoplifting were those between 41 and 50 years of age, followed by those aged between 51 and 60 years. Police said there was no distinction between gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mong Kok, Tsuen Wan and Tseung Kwan O were the areas that recorded the largest numbers of shoplifting cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Common shoplifted items included pharmaceutical products, shampoo and razors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine and chocolate were the main targets from November to January each year, while fruit and ice cream were most popular during summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largest case involved two bottles of wine priced at around HK$130,000. The force said there was no fixed price range of stolen products, as shoplifters mainly act out of a sudden urge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They don't steal the items for the values of them. They don't need the items, they don't need the money," police clinical psychologist Michael Fung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In one study, more than 48 percent of them committed shoplifting because of their personal loss, psychological loss in recent times. It could be losing their spouse, their loved ones, their job, or mobility or health. That somehow triggered their depression or negative feelings, negative mood, [and] they need to find a way to cope with that.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police have offered security suggestions for the retail sector, such as allocating more staff to assist customers, arranging for security guards in plain-clothes to patrol shop floors, and upgrading surveillance cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police noted that shoplifters look the same as ordinary customers, but there are a few ways to identify potential thieves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, [shoplifters] wear extraordinarily big clothing during very hot seasons, as it is easy for them to put stolen property into their clothes and just walk out, or bringing extraordinarily big bags that are empty at first... these might be hints they want to do something,” chief inspector Kelly Choi, who works on crime prevention, said.

    HKUMed adopts generative AI literacy into curriculum

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The HKU faculty of medicine will offer a generative AI literary series as a course to facilitate and enhance teaching and learning, through various multimedia methods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department has developed a simulation education system called KASES to imitate real-life patient scenarios and an app that helps classify X-rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of their disciplines or year of study, students can use these virtual systems with information compiled and validated by professors to practice the process of clinical reasoning and history taking. This particularly benefits first-year medical students who are not yet able to attend clinicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical Associate Professor and Director of Educational Technology Dr Gary Lau explained the need for AI literacy in the medical field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our future healthcare professionals must understand not only the potentials of generative AI but also the ethical issues, potential legal aspects, and professional considerations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While AI offers new opportunities for learning, Lau stressed the importance of not becoming over dependent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Teaching can not be purely replaced by AI. It will enhance our teaching, but the interaction of our students with real life patients is highly invaluable and cannot be replaced."

    'Treat DSE results day as a learning opportunity'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Students will be receiving their DSE results on July 17. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761605_1_20240715100208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A clinical psychologist said students who do not receive an ideal grade on their DSE exams should not feel discouraged, and instead treat the experience as a learning opportunity to build resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students will be receiving their results on Wednesday and Dr Martina Cheung, from Castle Peak Hospital, said results day is a chance for students to build stress-coping techniques in the face of a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that students can use the "MANGO" technique to train their psychological muscle in accepting undesirable results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said the M stands for meaning and purpose in which students can treat the experience as a learning opportunity, while A, for acceptance, encourages students to accept the results rather than to question it. She said the N for nurture pushes students to take care of their bodies and practise mindfulness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "G is for gratitude and generosity because some research show that if a person can have gratitude, it's better for their mood so they can think about what they can feel grateful, and also it's important to be generous to others because by helping others, one can focus on others rather than themselves. The research shows that it can reduce the anxiety and also the depressive symptoms," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last one is optimism. By having some positive visualisation of the future, it can improve the mood of the students and also when a person has better mood, they can have broader perspective and also can have better creativity to think about how to solve the problems."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung stressed that parents should ask how their child would like to be supported during these times, and give them the space and freedom to process the results.

    'Cool it down,' Biden says after assassination attempt

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden sought to calm a divided nation after his rival Donald Trump survived an assassination bid, saying in a rare Oval Office address on Sunday it was time to lower the temperature of America's hostile politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "You know, the political record in this country has gotten very heated. It's time to cool it down," Biden said in the televised speech, just the third he has given from behind the historic Resolute Desk during his presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the country reeled from images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, Biden added that US politics "must never be a literal battlefield, a, God forbid, a killing field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old Democrat said that both sides had a responsibility to ease the situation ahead of a deeply divided election that would now be a "time of testing" for the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators said that they were still probing the motives of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot dead by snipers at the event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday after firing multiple shots with a legally-bought semi-automatic rifle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former president Trump said on social media on Sunday that Americans should not allow "evil to win," adding it was "more important than ever that we stand United." (AFP)

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun is looking to take part in his second Olympics next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clinched gold in men's single sculls in the lightweight category of the World Rowing Cup in May, which involved athletes weighing no more than 72.5 kilogrammes. Now, he's taking on a whole new challenge by participating in the open category in the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu told RTHK he's adopting a new strategy that he believes will better prepare him against the "real giants".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The civil defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said Sunday that 15 people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering war displaced where the Israeli military said it had targeted "terrorists".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike on the UN-run Abu Araban site in central Gaza's Nuseirat camp was the fifth on a school-turned-shelter in eight days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Abu Araban school was housing "thousands of displaced people," civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said, adding that most of the dead were women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools in Nuseirat were the target for two of the earlier school strikes as Israel keeps up its offensive against Hamas Palestinian militants who triggered the war with their October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its air force "struck a number of terrorists who were operating in the area of UNRWA's Abu Araban school building in Nuseirat".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the building had "served as a hideout" and base for "attacks" on Israeli troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says Hamas uses schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure for military purposes. Hamas denies the accusation. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina captain Lionel Messi hopes forward Angel Di Maria ends his international career with a goal in Sunday's Copa America final against Colombia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Di Maria, 36, announced in November his plans to retire from internationals after representing his country for 15 years and Messi wants him to get his name on the scoresheet as he did against Brazil to clinch the continental title in 2021 and against France as they won the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe he'll score another goal in the final like he did in all the previous ones he's played in. It would be extraordinary," Messi said in an interview with Direct TV Sports, adding that the team still hopes he will reverse his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always tell him that if everything goes well, we have playoff games coming up. Nevertheless, 'Fideo' (Di Maria) has made up his mind and there's nothing that can change it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Di Maria has scored 31 goals in 144 appearances for Argentina, having played in six Copa Americas and four World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also struck the winner in Argentina's 1-0 victory over Nigeria to win Olympic gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. (Reuters)

    Kenya police say 8 bodies found in Nairobi dumpsite

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Onlookers gather at the dumpsite where six bodies were found in the landfill in Mukuru slum, Nairobi. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761558_1_20240714185003.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight female bodies have been recovered so far from a dumpsite in a Nairobi slum, Kenyan police said on Sunday, adding that they were pursuing possible links to cults, serial killers or rogue medical practitioners.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gruesome discoveries of mutilated and dismembered bodies dumped in plastic bags in a rubbish tip in Mukuru in the south of the Kenyan capital have horrified and angered the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's acting national police chief Douglas Kanja said the first six corpses were found on Friday and more body parts were retrieved on Saturday, with preliminary investigations revealing that all were female.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were severely dismembered in different states of decomposition and left in sacks," Kanja told a press conference, adding that investigations were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kanja also called for public cooperation in "so that we bring the perpetrators of these heinous acts to book".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amin Mohammed, the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, said the ages of the victims ranged between about 18 to 30 and that all had been killed and butchered in the same manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police were looking into a number of hypotheses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we dealing with a cult that is associated with criminal activities, are we dealing with serial killers," he said at the press briefing alongside Kanja.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We even could be dealing with rogue medical practitioners [involved in] criminal activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya was left reeling last year by the discovery of mass graves in a forest near the Indian Ocean coast containing the bodies of more than 400 members of a doomsday sect, one of the world's worst cult-related massacres. (AFP)

    Alcaraz dominates Djokovic to retain Wimbledon crown

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz overpowered seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets to retain his Wimbledon title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish third seed produced a performance combining awesome power with delicate touch to win 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), collecting the fourth Grand Slam of his young career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz equals the Open Era record for most Grand Slams won at the age 21 or under, joining Boris Becker, Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he is just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, who had knee surgery just weeks ago, was aiming to win a 25th Grand Slam - which would have been a record in the men's and women's game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he had no answers in the Centre Court sunshine as the electric Alcaraz pounded him from the back of the court and treated the crowd to an array of his trademark drop shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it is a dream for me winning this trophy," said the Spaniard. "I did an interview when I was 11 and I said my dream is to win Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me this is the most beautiful tournament, the most beautiful court and the most beautiful trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz paid tribute to his beaten opponent, who only found his range in the third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Djokovic is an unbelievable fighter, I knew he was going to have his chances," said Alcaraz who had needed five sets to defeat the Serb in the 2023 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult but I tried to stay calm going into the tie-break and tried to play my best tennis. I was glad at the end I could find the solutions."(AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slammed South Korean "scum" on Sunday for launching anti-regime propaganda leaflets across the border via balloon, warning they would pay "a very high price".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Korean peninsula has seen tit-for-tat balloon campaigns in recent weeks, with Pyongyang floating trash-filled balloons southward in protest of ones carrying propaganda leaflets sent northward by South Korean activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim Yo Jong, a key regime spokesperson, said she was informed the latest batch of "dirty leaflets and things of the ROK scum" had been found in North Korean territory along the border, according to a statement carried in English by the official Korean Central News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ROK is an abbreviation of South Korea's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korean military personnel were "now making an all-out search, throwing into fire and disposing of the found rubbishes", she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the ROK scum are not stopping this crude and dirty play," she added, using the initials of the North's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ROK clans will be tired from suffering a bitter embarrassment and must be ready for paying a very high price."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang has already sent more than a thousand balloons carrying trash southward in what it says is retaliation for balloons carrying propaganda criticising Kim Jong Un's rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="France's President Emmanuel Macron speaks with his wife Brigitte Macron during the Bastille Day military parade along the Avenue Foch in Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761553_1_20240714182159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The French armed forces will take an unusual detour at the start of their annual Bastille Day march on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations to host the Olympic Games blocked the national day parade from its traditional route on the Champs Elysees, and a smaller military contingent will instead march on the nearby Avenue Foch - one of the most prestigious streets in Paris and one of the most expensive addresses in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All eyes will be on the host, President Emmanuel Macron, who last year cut a more impressive figure, hosting rising superpower India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at France's triumphant national day parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, with the Olympics just around the corner, France has no international star guest for this year's parade - and French political leaders' minds will be elsewhere, pondering the power vacuum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This month's snap elections, called by Macron to clarify France's direction after the far right sent shock-waves through the political establishment by coming first in European polls, left the country without a ruling minority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, the reduced and rerouted parade risks becoming a new symbol of drift, even with the addition of the arrival in Paris of the Olympic Torch, ahead of the July 26 to August 11 Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No tank or armoured vehicle will take part, and only 4,000 foot soldiers will march, down from 6,500 last year, but the military fly-past will see 45 aeroplanes and 22 helicopters soar over Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regiments honoured on the parade will include those from France's allies and former French colonies that took part in the country's 1944 World War II liberation 80 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parade's final section will also honour the Olympic spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  In an Instagram post, the swimmer said he spent more than three hours on the last seven kilometres due to the current.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also wrote: "not fast but once again my fat is proven life-saving – average water temperature is 12.7 degrees Celsius, but I am sure most of it was 11 degrees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who used the challenge to raise funds for charities supporting grassroots youth development, thanked his fans for all their support.

    Hydrogen bus makes maiden cross-harbour trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A double-decker hydrogen bus has made its maiden cross harbour journey on Sunday, with route 170 passing through three toll tunnels, including Aberdeen Tunnel, Cross Harbour Tunnel and Lion Rock Tunnel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Richard Hall, the managing director of Citybus, said the company aims to phase out diesel buses in the next few years with plans of operating a full fleet of zero-emission buses by 2045. He said the company plans to purchase a large number of electric buses and bring in at least five hydrogen buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By running those vehicles in parallel, we have a greater volume. We will be able to get more data that will enable our future design and purchasing decisions. In terms of fares, fares have to rise on an ongoing basis. Fares are critical to supporting the sustainability of our operations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fares ensure that our employees, citizens of Hong Kong, ensure that they can meet their cost of living and continue to keep pace with inflation. Fare increases also allows us to invest in new technology, improving our bus operations and delivering a great solution to all the citizens of Hong Kong that they can be proud of."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hall said their fleet composition in the future will compose of 70 percent hydrogen buses and 30 percent electric buses. He also said that Hong Kong would be put at the forefront of international and technological development for new energy solutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people were already queuing at Wah Fu Bus Terminus at around 6am to board the first scheduled bus of the day. A man surnamed Wong said he is worried about travelling through tunnels in a hydrogen bus given that it is flammable, but he said he believes the company had undergone many tests before its release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Diesel buses run on diesel so it releases a lot of exhaust smoke, and the bus is pretty loud when it is running. The hydrogen bus is a lot quieter and you can only hear the sound of the air conditioning. It is quiet inside and out," said another passenger surnamed Yau.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Sunday said the government has received an overwhelming response for the light public housing programme, receiving nearly 10,000 applications for flats under the project.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The housing minister noted that the administration received over 9,600 applications for the first batch of some 4,400 units located in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok, which will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants for these units must have been on the waiting list for conventional public housing for at least three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on a social media post, Ho urged eligible people to submit their applications regardless, saying that even if they do not get a unit this time, they will be prioritised in future rounds of applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also mentioned that she had visited the community in Tsuen Wan on Saturday to explain details of the programme to those who are interested, and reassured them not to worry about adjusting to a new living environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have visited people who only ever lived in the urban area and had never lived in the New Territories. They initially moved to Yuen Long with great trepidation. However, within a week or two, they found that adapting was surprisingly easy,” she wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The priority application period for the scheme closes on Monday.

    Timeframe needed for anti-child abuse bill reasonable

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during a 18-month period to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761525_1_20240714170919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Sunday said it is reasonable for a newly passed law to make reporting of child abuse mandatory to come into effect 18 months after it is gazetted.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Sun said given the complexity and scale of the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill – which requires certain professionals to report to the authorities when they suspect serious child abuse cases – a year and a half is a reasonable timeframe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand that this involves 25 different professions and there are over 100,000 people involved. There’s a lot to work on,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what needs to be done? First, we need to create detailed guidelines. We need to train these 100,000 people and make sure they understand. On the other hand, we need to prepare for the aftermath. We expect an increase in reported cases, so that we need to have enough staff, facilities, and emergency resources. Everything needs to be in place before we can proceed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during the 18-month period, which will be used to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding the Social Workers Registration Board, which saw seven of eight elected members of the current term resign, Sun said he is confident that other social workers would be willing to join the board when the next election takes place at the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the TVB interview, the minister also said he did not think it was too harsh to permanently revoke the licences of social workers who have been convicted of national security offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that it does not mean the administration is not giving a second chance to social workers who have committed other crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our judgement is the mainstream view of the society and the Legislative Council, is that social workers who have committed crimes against national security are out of the question. This is a lifetime suspension arrangement. But for social workers who have committed other crimes, I want to be very clear, we are very tolerant, as long as the circumstances allow and everyone thinks it's appropriate, they can still be social workers."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that public secondary school exam results due this Wednesday should not define the future of candidates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said regardless of the results, young people can find and develop their own future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation nowadays are rebuilding different industries around the world, as well as our lifestyles," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So long as young people embrace changes, dare to imagine and keep learning, and are determined to move forward, they can surely break new ground and develop their own future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that there are ups and downs in life, and people should persevere through success and failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that the government has been promoting development in innovation and a diverse economy, with the hopes of providing more quality jobs for young people, while enhancing the economy's development, momentum and resilience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil service minister Ingrid Yeung, for her part, said public exam results are not everything in life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said for those who intend to serve the public, they can try to learn more about jobs that the government offers as early as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can be a step quicker than others and plan your career, equip yourself for the future, " she wrote on social media.

    Taxi fare hikes come into force

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fares went into effect on Sunday with the flagfall of red urban taxis increasing from HK$27 to HK$29, but some passengers say it is not the right time to raise prices, which also went up for green and blue taxis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For green New Territories taxis, flagfall went from HK$23.5 to HK$25.5, while the fares went up HK$2 for blue Lantau taxis to HK$24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After flagfall, the incremental charges for each 200 metres travelled under first-tier rates have also gone from HK$1.9 to HK$2.1 for urban taxis and from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9 for New Territories and Lantau taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-tier distance charges are up from HK$1.3 to HK$1.4 for urban and New Territories taxis, and from HK$1.5 to HK$1.6 for Lantau taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Ko told RTHK that now is not the right time to be increasing fares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy isn't doing well right now, and suddenly they are increasing the fare by so much. The fares keep going higher and higher. Taxi drivers actually told me they don't want the fares to go up. They said if the fares go up, so does the rental costs for their vehicles so they don't really profit from this," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman, surnamed Cheung, said she does not mind the fare increase, but hopes that taxi services can improve. She said some cabs smelt of cigarette smoke and drivers had been rude to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Tong said people who take taxis frequently will not mind the fare increase, adding that he has had good experiences with taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a taxi driver surnamed Choi estimated that the fare increase could earn him HK$5 to HK$10 more for every HK$100. He said he does not think business will take a hit because of the fare hike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people rely on taxis like those who are in a hurry or people who are immobile. I don't think they will mind that extra dollar or two," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said on Sunday that officials will not set a cap for booking fees for future taxi fleets, which they hope will hit the streets by the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government is set to give out five licenses for these fleets this month, which it hopes can provide high quality taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked whether passengers will find booking fees troublesome, the minister said people are familiar with online car-hailing services, and that booking charges will be something that will be left up to the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We won't be setting a maximum booking fee level. We believe the market will make adjustments. Of course, we hope that the fleets and the users will come up with their own reasonable amount in this regard," Lam said on a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed the taxi fleets must provide online car-hailing services, adding the Transport Department will be providing links on its website to their platforms and mobile apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said that taxi fleets will be given the freedom to design the looks and logos of their vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government – which will carry out a year-long study on passenger demand and how their needs are changing – plans to regulate online car-hailing services by issuing licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said the administration's study does not take the price of taxi licences into consideration, adding that officials have the overall public interest in mind, and stressed that the government wants to maintain a highly efficient public transport system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secret Service said former president Donald Trump was "safe" after he was rushed off stage when gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the bangs rang out, 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X, and his campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in a bitter replay of their 2020 clash, said there was "no place for this kind of violence in America".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said in a statement, adding: "I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old, staying at his house in Rehoboth, Delaware, gave a televised statement repeating his message, saying "we cannot be like this".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. (AFP)

    UK's Labour party to focus on 'turbo charging growth'

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761499_1_20240714060120.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's incoming Labour government will focus on measures to "turbo charge growth" when it unveils its legislative plans at next week's King's Speech, prime minister Keir Starmer said in comments released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "From energy, to planning, to unbreakable fiscal rules, my government is serious about delivering the stability that is going to turbo charge growth that will create wealth in every corner of the UK," said Starmer, whose party won a huge landslide earlier this month, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our work is urgent. There is no time to waste. We are hitting the ground running by bringing forward the laws we will need to rebuild our country for the long-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The task of national renewal will not be easy... but the legislation set out at the King's Speech will build on the momentum of our first days in office and make a difference to the lives of working people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charles III will deliver the King's Speech on Wednesday, as parliament formally reopens after the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite its name, the address is not written by the monarch but by the government which uses it to detail the laws it proposes to make over the coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it was working on more than 35 bills "to deliver an ambitious parliamentary session that will be built on a bedrock of economic security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include measures to enforce public spending rules and others to prevent a repeat of the utility bill price hikes that triggered the UK's recent cost-of-living crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislation will also flesh out announcements already made this week, such as the launching of a fund to draw investment into the UK and of a body tasked with boosting clean power by 2030, as well as the opening of recruitment for a new border security command. (AFP)

    Sanders voices support for Biden's candidacy

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win" says independent Senator Bernie Sanders.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senator Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure of the US political left, on Saturday threw his support behind Joe Biden's White House campaign, dismissing calls for the president to withdraw from the race over health concerns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Enough! Mr Biden may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate," independent senator Sanders wrote in a New York Times column, adding that "it's time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders's column comes amid steadily growing calls from Democratic officials and donors for the 81-year-old Biden to step aside following a disastrous performance in his June 27 debate with former president Donald Trump. So far, some 20 members of Congress have called for him to leave the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls taken since the debate show Trump with a national lead over Biden, though within the margin of error. They also show some key battleground states, including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, shifting in the Republican's favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a majority of Americans – including Democrats – believe Biden is too old to serve again, according to a recent poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president did not help his own cause when, at a summit in Washington earlier this week, he mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, however, insisted during an appearance on Friday that he is, and will remain, his party's flagbearer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am running and we're going to win," he told an enthusiastic audience in Detroit, amid chants of "Don't you quit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris doubled down her support for Biden, calling him a "fighter" at a campaign event on Saturday in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where Trump is also holding a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, we will continue to fight. We will continue to organise. And in November, we will win," said Harris, who some pundits have speculated could lead the Democratic ticket if Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seeking to allay concerns, Biden spoke with members of the Democratic Party's left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus in a virtual meeting on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will also sit for interviews next week with NBC News and Black Entertainment Television (BET).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders, who at 82 is himself seeking reelection to the Senate in November, did acknowledge the signs of the president's aging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But given Biden's achievements – and the record of Trump, "who has 34 felony convictions and... has told thousands of documented lies" – the senator brushed Biden's shortcomings aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, I know," he wrote. "Mr Biden is old, is prone to gaffes, walks stiffly and had a disastrous debate with Mr Trump. But this I also know: A presidential election is not an entertainment contest. It does not begin or end with a 90-minute debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed the eruption of anti-Biden rhetoric partly on "the corporate media (which) has obsessively focused on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders also blamed those Democrats who he said had "joined that circular firing squad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He challenged the president to do more – to "propose and fight for a bold agenda" that would help lift working families "who have been left behind for far too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden, he concluded, was "a good and decent Democratic president with a record of real accomplishment," including helping rebuild the US economy and shoring up the country's crumbling infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win." (AFP)

    Baldwin thanks supporters after early end to trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 Alec Baldwin made his first public comments to thank his supporters on Saturday after the stunning early end to his involuntary manslaughter trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now," Baldwin said in a brief Instagram post that accompanied a photo of him sitting in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom. “To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor wept a day earlier when Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case three days into the trial and said he could not be criminally charged again in the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Neither he nor his lawyers spoke to reporters as he left the courthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evidence that sank the case was ammunition that was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammunition unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers alleged they “buried” it and filed a motion to dismiss the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge said the withholding of the evidence tainted the “fundamental fairness” of the trial of the 66-year-old Baldwin, who could have gotten 18 months in prison if he were convicted. (AP)

    Death toll in Gaza camp 'safe zone' strike rises to 90

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel had declared Al-Mawasi a "safe zone" as it pushed into Rafah near the Egyptian border, but on Saturday Palestinians raced to collect dozens of casualties from the military's latest strike.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sirens wailed and women screamed as children were pulled bloody and unmoving from the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What have they done? they're children, children," one woman cried. "Seven-year-old and 12-year-old children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Mawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people had sought refuge, was left a chaos-strewn wasteland by one of the deadliest Israeli strikes since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas-run territory's health ministry said at least 90 people were killed, half of them women and children. It said another 300 people were wounded in the "massacre".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an attack in the Khan Younis area had targeted Hamas military strategist Mohammed Deif and Rafa Salama, a brigade commander, but there was "no certainty that the two were eliminated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located near the city of Khan Younis, Al-Mawasi was designated a humanitarian area after Israel in May ordered civilians to evacuate from other parts of the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been warning for months that there is no safe place for anyone in Gaza amid Israel's military bombardment," said UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians, which operates health sites in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said hundreds of thousands of displaced people were sheltering in the "safe zone," which had been targeted before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Black smoke billowed behind a wide, ash-strewn street in Al-Mawasi where bodies lay in pools of blood, some covered by sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Men struggling to carry the wounded wove through those beyond help to reach ambulances waiting with open doors. Others were piled onto donkey-pulled carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who have lost limbs everywhere. It's a scene the mind cannot even imagine," Mahmoud Chahine said near a market struck in the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Nasser Hospital reportedly saying it was at full capacity, ambulances kept arriving, carting in the wounded on orange stretchers, including a man with a towel tied around his leg as a makeshift tourniquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman outside the hospital could be heard pleading: "Please enough, enough for God's sake."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said the attack against Deif "struck an open area" that "was not a tent complex but an operational compound."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our information, only Hamas terrorists were present and there were no civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Netanyahu's office, he had discussed the strike with security and military officials as part of his goal "to eliminate senior Hamas officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called the claim that Deif had been targeted "false allegations" intended "to cover up the magnitude of the horrific massacre" in Al-Mawasi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said heavy fire was preventing its teams from reaching the "many bodies" scattered in the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmoud Abu Akar, an eyewitness, described repeated missiles raining down on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time people tried to get close to rescue others, they would strike," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was no warning at all, it happened all of a sudden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since telling people to relocate to Al-Mawasi in May, the Israeli military has been accused of repeatedly striking the area in deadly attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June the International Committee of the Red Cross said 22 people were killed by shelling that damaged its office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Returning from the Nasser Hospital on Saturday, Louise Wateridge, from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said children had suffered life-changing injuries and people were angry there was no reprieve from the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no safety here, no matter where people go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's strike came on the 281st day of the war that was unleashed by Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, which resulted in 1,195 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military reprisal has killed at least 38,443 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday his government had "no certainty" that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in a strike that officials in Hamas-run Gaza said killed dozens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israel attacked Gaza today in an attempt to eliminate Mohammed Deif and his deputy, Rafa Salama," Netanyahu told a press conference hours after the attack on Al-Mawasi, a designated safe zone in Gaza's south sheltering displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no certainty that the two were eliminated," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 71 people were killed and nearly 300 wounded in the strike on Al-Mawasi, near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had designated the area a safe zone and told civilians in other areas in Gaza to go there for safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu described Deif, head of the Hamas military wing, as "the planner and leader" of the October 7 attack that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring back all hostages from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The elimination of the heads of Hamas advances the achievement of all our objectives," said the right-wing premier who faces mounting opposition to the conduct of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent weeks, we have identified clear cracks within Hamas," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's operation also contributes to this, regardless of what its outcomes will be." (AFP)

    Last-gasp drop goal lifts Ireland over Springboks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland toppled world champions South Africa 25-24 with a drop goal by Ciaran Frawley in the last second of a ferocious body-smashing contest at Kings Park on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Irish rebounded from losing 27-20 last weekend in Pretoria by notching only their second ever win over the Springboks in South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It didn't look like it would happen after the Springboks came back from 16-6 down at halftime, finding another gear and forcing errors that Handre Pollard used to kick eight penalties from eight attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after falling behind 24-19 with 15 minutes to go, Ireland found the energy to pin South Africa in their 22. They waived off a penalty kick to go for a try and squandered a tapped penalty. But, out of nowhere, replacement flyhalf Frawley lined up a 42-metre drop goal in the 70th minute to keep them in touch at 25-22 behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irish, playing their 15th and last test of a super-long Rugby World Cup season, rallied yet again and, as the match clock ticked into the red, Frawley let fly with another drop goal from the same length as the first and won a gripping match and squared a classic series. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The lavish parties for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant end on Sunday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761488_1_20240714014258.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lavish wedding celebrations for the son of Asia's richest man resumed on Saturday with a star-studded guest list including Hollywood celebrities, global business leaders and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani's youngest son Anant and his fiancee Radhika Merchant, both 29, are tying the knot over the weekend in Mumbai following months of pre-marriage parties that have set a new benchmark in matrimonial extravagance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's itinerary included a blessing ceremony during which the world's rich and famous greeted the couple at the wedding venue, a 16,000-capacity convention centre owned by the Ambani family's conglomerate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage from inside shared by local broadcasters showed Modi, whose policies have been warmly supported by the groom's father over his decade in power, was among the guests to pay their respects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event followed a formal ceremony and party on Friday attended by the likes of socialite Kim Kardashian, actor John Cena, and former British premiers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA boss Gianni Infantino, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and Samsung chairman Jay Y Lee were among the hundreds of other famous figures present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Best wishes to the new couple and double happiness!" Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong posted on social media platform X along with footage of the couple from inside the venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This weekend's celebrations end on Sunday with a reception party, and cap months of extravagant pre-wedding festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier events this year included a party at the Ambanis' ancestral home where a purpose-built Hindu temple was unveiled, and private performances by R&B star Rihanna and Canada's Justin Bieber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guests at that gala included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former US president Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, along with a who's who of India's sporting and entertainment worlds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, the couple embarked on a four-day Mediterranean cruise along with 1,200 guests, with singer Katy Perry performing at a masquerade ball at a French chateau in Cannes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mumbai this year overtook Beijing to become the Asian city with the most billionaires, according to a Chinese research institute survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite India being the world's fastest growing economy, the gap between rich and poor remains vast. More than half of the country's 1.4 billion people live on less than four dollars per day, according to World Bank figures from 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the wedding and its VIP attendees have been the subject of relentless and laudatory media coverage in India, the reaction among the public has been mixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They must have spent over US$60 million, while I will struggle to earn just US$400 this month," said Mumbai general store worker Jitesh Ingle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But this is our life. What can we do? We can only watch their celebrations on YouTube."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anant's father Mukesh is chairman of Reliance Industries, a family-founded conglomerate that has grown into India's biggest company by market cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patriarch is the world's 11th richest person with a fortune of more than US$123 billion, according to Forbes, and is no stranger to making a statement when it comes to family marriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He held the most expensive wedding in India to date for his daughter in 2018, which reportedly cost US$100 million and saw US singer Beyonce perform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family's lucrative interests include retail partnerships with Armani and other luxury brands, more than 40 percent of India's mobile phone market and an Indian Premier League cricket team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 27-floor family home Antilia is one of Mumbai's most prominent landmarks, reportedly costing more than US$1 billion to build and with a permanent staff of 600 servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchant is the daughter of well-known pharmaceutical moguls. (AFP)

 A resurgent Wallabies earned their first back-to-back Test wins since 2021 on Saturday with a hard-fought 36-28 victory over Wales, who extended their horror run to nine straight defeats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Filipo Daugunu scored twice with Jake Gordon and Allan Alaalatoa also crossing on a wet and cold Melbourne night to back up their 25-16 triumph in Sydney a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took a 23-14 lead into the break and withstood intense second-half pressure and a series of handling errors to seal the series 2-0 and give new coach Joe Schmidt the second win of his tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was tough, bit of relief at the end there," said Wallabies skipper James Slipper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was scrappy from us for sure, it wasn't our best game, but we got the result. There's plenty to work on though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are gritty, they hang in there, they played our kicking game really well tonight," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat piled more pain on Warren Gatland's team which is now one loss away from equalling Wales' all-time record of 10 consecutive defeats, which came in 2002 and 2003 under another New Zealander, Steve Hansen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have slumped to 11th in the world rankings, below Fiji and Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite clawing back from 17-0 down after 25 minutes, they paid the price for conceding too many penalties and again lost the breakdown battle, sorely missing injured workhorse No 8 Aaron Wainwright.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We never gave up, we had a never-say-die attitude," said Wales captain Dewi Lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But obviously we are a young team and we don't have enough experience really at Test level. What matters is results and we are not giving ourselves those at the moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taine Plumtree assumed Wainwright's role in the back row with James Botham, grandson of England cricket great Ian Botham, starting at blindside flanker and Tommy Reffell at openside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were immediately exposed as Australia scored inside seven minutes with a move that started from near their own try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under pressure, wing Andrew Kellaway sidestepped the Welsh defence then collected his own chip before offloading to a charging Fraser McReight who powered up the field and found Daugunu to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the rain hammering down, they kept the pressure on with Lolesio making it 10-0 off the tee with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu made a try-saving tackle on Botham as Wales warmed to the task, but it was Australia who scored once more against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scrum-half Gordon sent up a box kick and a handling error from fullback Cam Winnett allowed him to collect it and weave past two defenders to the try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undeterred, a well-worked rolling maul from the lineout saw Lake muscle over to get Wales on the board after half-an-hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Australia's Lukhan Salakaia-Loto in the sin-bin he repeated the feat soon afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both tries were converted to get Wales back in the game at 20-14 and an early converted try to veteran winger Liam Williams in the second-half put the Wallabies on notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the hosts proved they too could work a rolling maul, with Alaalatoa powering over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu got his second after a schoolboy error from Williams, who tried to keep the ball in play from a Wallabies kick, only to palm it perfectly to a charging Daugunu who surged to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Australia a 33-21 lead, but they went to sleep and Wales winger Rio Dyer smashed over in the corner to set up a tense finale. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, however, have now been arrested on a new graft charge.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court overturned ex-prime minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed after fresh charges were swiftly brought against him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Khan was slapped with a trio of convictions in the days before February elections – cases he says were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cases have now all been at least partially rolled back on appeal, with a treason conviction carrying a decade jail term overturned in April, and a 14-year graft sentence suspended in June, though the conviction still stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi had also been sentenced to seven years for allegedly marrying too soon after her divorce, in a breach of Islamic law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an Islamabad judge announced on Saturday that the couple's appeals were accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan remains locked up, though, with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party saying a court in eastern Lahore had approved his arrest over three cases alleging he incited riots in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokesman Ahmed Janjua said it was "yet another gimmick to keep the illegal imprisonment prolonged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, PTI said Khan and Bibi had also been arrested on a separate graft case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month a UN panel of experts found Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose," it said, calling for his immediate release after nearly a year in jail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In opposition he waged a campaign of defiance against the generals, who directly ruled Pakistan for decades of its history, even accusing them of being behind an assassination attempt that wounded him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the former cricket star's comeback was hobbled by scores of legal cases, which analysts say were likely brought at the behest of the military establishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was first briefly arrested in May 2023, sparking nationwide unrest from PTI supporters, some of which targeted military facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government and military cited the attacks as justification for a sweeping crackdown on PTI, which saw its senior leadership decimated by arrests and defections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PTI candidates were forced to stand as independents in the February 8 elections, which had been repeatedly delayed amid political chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan's arrest and conviction for graft in August 2023 meant he was barred from standing for office himself, confined to a cell in Adiala Jail south of Islamabad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the setbacks, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless they were blocked from power by a broad coalition of military-backed rival parties, amid widespread allegations of vote-tampering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gallup Pakistan analyst Bilal Gilani said the rolling back of the cases against Khan now could suggest the establishment was softening its stance in the wake of the election – or that the courts were defying their attempts to keep him confined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an important judgement, because essentially now there are a limited number of cases left," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Immediate release is quite impossible, but... the chances of release are getting clearer by the day," he added. (AFP)

 Tadej Pogacar extended his overall lead on the Tour de France when he won stage 14 in the Pyrenees on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His arch rival Jonas Vingegaard came second at 39sec while Remco Evenepoel was third at 1min 10sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of another monster run in the Pyrenees on Sunday, Pogacar extended his lead to 1min 57sec over Vingegaard as Evenepoel dropped to third at 2min 22sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar's team UAE waited until the third and final climb of the day before sending Adam Yates on an attack that the Slovenian would soon join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Pogacar unleashed a ferocious acceleration, his two podium rivals followed, but were either unwilling or unable to match the pace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the final section of a climb, packed on either side by raucous fans, 2020 and 2021 champion Pogacar extended his lead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barbora Krejcikova won Wimbledon for her second Grand Slam title with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 victory over Jasmine Paolini in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is a 28-year-old from the Czech Republic who adds this trophy to her championship at the French Open in 2021 .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was unseeded in Paris back then and was only the 31st of 32 seeds at the All England Club after illness and a back injury this season limited her to a 7-9 record entering this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is the eighth woman to leave Wimbledon as the champion in the past eight editions of the event. Last year's champion is also from the Czech Republic: unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, who lost in the first round last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seventh-seeded Paolini was the runner-up at the French Open last month and is the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to get to the finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same season. (AP)

    Kremlin warns US missiles could make Europe a target

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggests that deploying US missiles in Europe will automatically make European capitals Russian targets. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761478_1_20240713225234.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Saturday warned the deployment of US missiles in Germany could make European capitals targets for Russian missiles in a repeat of Cold War-style confrontation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke of a "paradox" in which "Europe is a target for our missiles, our country is a target for US missiles in Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enough capacity to contain these missiles but the potential victims are the capitals of these countries," he said, speaking to Russian state television channel Russia 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peskov also hinted that such a confrontation could undermine Europe as a whole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Europe is not living its best moment. In a different configuration, a repeat of history is inevitable," he said when the channel's anchor Pavel Zarubin pointed out that the Cold War had ended with the Soviet Union's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House announced on Wednesday during a Nato summit that it would periodically station long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Germany from 2026 as a deterrent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exercising these advanced capabilities will demonstrate the United States' commitment to Nato and its contributions to European integrated deterrence," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin criticised the move, accusing Washington of taking a step towards a new Cold War and of directly participating in the conflict in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov held a telephone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin where they discussed lowering the risk of "possible escalation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato countries – spearheaded by the United States – have bolstered their defences in Europe following the start of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine in 2022. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Saturday arrested a man after two suitcases believed to contain the remains of two men were dumped on a famous bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suitcases were discovered on Wednesday after police got a report of a man behaving suspiciously on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, southwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Detectives have arrested a man in connection with an investigation into the discovery of human remains on Clifton Suspension Bridge," said the Metropolitan Police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old suspect was detained in Bristol and will be taken to London for questioning later on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Metropolitan Police said the victims have not been formally identified, but both are believed to be men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-based force took over the investigation after evidence suggested that the wanted man had travelled to Bristol from the UK capital earlier on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is one of the oldest surviving suspension bridges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opened in 1864, the bridge over the Avon Gorge is one of Bristol's top tourist attractions and a symbol of the city. (AFP)

    Pakistan pledges US$7 billion IMF aid deal is last

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761475_1_20240713213426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund has agreed to loan Pakistan US$7 billion to bolster its faltering economy, with Islamabad pledging on Saturday it would be the last time it relied on relief from the Washington-based lender.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Asian nation agreed to the deal – its 24th IMF payout since 1958 – in exchange for unpopular reforms, including widening its chronically low tax base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan last year came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries, as well as an IMF rescue package, but its finances remain in dire straits, with high inflation and staggering public debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This programme should be considered the last programme," Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told ministers and revenue officials in Islamabad. "We should tax those who are not being taxed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan announced on Friday, which will be paid out over three years subject to approval by the organisation's Executive Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came on condition of far-reaching reforms including hiking household bills to remedy a permanently crisis-stricken energy sector and uplifting pitiful tax takings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a nation of over 240 million people and where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the 2024-25 fiscal year that started at the beginning of July, the government aims to raise nearly US$46 billion in taxes, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More unusual methods have seen the tax authority block 210,000 SIM cards of mobile users who have not filed tax returns in a bid to widen the revenue bracket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the deal "revenue collections will be supported by simpler and fairer direct and indirect taxation including by bringing net income from the retail, export, and agriculture sectors properly into the tax system", IMF Pakistan Mission Chief Nathan Porter said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad also aims to reduce its fiscal deficit by 1.5 percent to 5.9 percent in the coming year, heeding another key IMF demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF said the loan and its conditions should allow Pakistan to "cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Pakistan's public debt remains huge at US$242 billion, and servicing it will still swallow up half of the government's income in 2024, according to the IMF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have criticised Islamabad's measures as surface-level reforms aimed at courting the IMF without addressing underlying problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to not see old patterns in this new IMF deal," said Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The IMF has issued a loan similar in size and conditions as the one agreed to five years ago, and five years before that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will authorities seize the opportunity thus created to embark on fundamental reforms to how the country is run?" he asked. "You would be well-advised not to hold your breath."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Sharif came to power in February elections marred by allegations of rigging, with ex-PM Imran Khan jailed and barred from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The diet of strict economic measures introduced by his shaky coalition government is likely to undermine their popularity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have already been scattered protests over tax and bill hikes introduced in last month's budget – prepared with IMF oversight – and more demonstrations are scheduled for the coming weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While around 40 percent of the population already lives below the poverty line, the World Bank said in April it feared that 10 million additional Pakistanis would fall below this threshold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's last US$3 billion loan from the IMF in 2023 proved a lifeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also came on the condition of unpopular austerity measures, including an end to subsidies cushioning consumer costs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepali rescue teams on Saturday recovered the first body from around 50 people missing after monsoon rains triggered a landslide that swept two buses off a highway and into a river.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force of Friday's landslide in central Chitwan district pushed the vehicles over concrete crash barriers and down a steep embankment, at least 30 metres from the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One body has been found about 55 kilometres from the accident site," said police spokesman Kumar Neupane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District official Khimananda Bhusal said that roughly 50 people remained unaccounted for, revising down the number of missing from the 63 reported by authorities on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to confirm the total number because we don't know if the buses stopped to add or remove passengers along the way," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of rescuers spent hours struggling to comb the raging Trishuli river with rafts, sensor equipment and dive teams to find any trace of the passengers or the vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teams on Saturday also moved downstream in hope of locating the missing passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fierce currents made worse by this week's torrential downpours have hampered their efforts so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chitwan district chief Indra Dev Yadav said that all authorities in the area have been instructed to stay on alert for any signs of the missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The river is narrow here and very deep," he said. "The water level is high, its speed is high and its turbidity is also high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accident happened before dawn on Friday along the Narayanghat-Mugling highway, around 100 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was heading from the capital to Gaur in Rautahat district in southern Nepal, and the other was en route to Kathmandu from southern Birgunj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A driver was killed in a separate accident on the same road after a boulder hit his bus. He died as he was being treated at a hospital. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wing Mark Tele'a scored two tries on Saturday as New Zealand squeezed past England 24-17 to win a hard-fought second Test in Auckland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tele'a touched down either side of half-time as the All Blacks took the series 2-0 and extended their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just like in the 16-15 first Test win at Dunedin, New Zealand had to wrestle back the lead in the second half from a spirited England side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hugely proud of the boys to hold on and win the arm wrestle and finish off a good performance," said New Zealand captain Scott Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Test matches certainly challenge your character and we had to dig deep there, right till the last minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Marcus Smith led the visitors to a 14-13 advantage at half-time after his pin-point cross-field kicks created tries for wing Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a breathless opening spell, the All Blacks took the lead when Tele'a caught the England defence napping from a ruck to dart over for a try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All Blacks fly-half Damian McKenzie landed the conversion, but England immediately hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith kicked wide into the arms of Feyi-Waboso, who stepped inside the defence for a converted try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand should have had a second try when Tele'a broke away, but Smith intercepted the final pass to Stephen Perofeta on the England tryline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed a penalty, but Smith quickly took the kick-off to pin the All Blacks deep in their own half, where they stayed for the next 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie stroked over another penalty, but England led at half-time after Freeman outleapt Tele'a to haul in Smith's kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England number 10 successfully converted from the touchline .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England started the second-half camped in the All Blacks half and Smith extended the lead to 17-13 with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half an hour left, scrum-half Cortez Ratima came on to make his All Blacks debut when he replaced the dazed Finlay Christie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game's momentum swung New Zealand's way when the All Blacks brought on Beauden Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The twice world player of the year showed his class by restoring the lead for New Zealand when he scythed through a gap to put Tele'a over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie missed the conversion, but landed two penalties to pull New Zealand out of England's reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors fought until the end with England captain Jamie George denied near the New Zealand line from scoring a potential match-levelling try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're a significantly better team than we when we started," said England captain George.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's hugely exciting times ahead for this English team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll welcome them to Twickenham in November, we'll look forward to that." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Gaza said an Israeli strike on a displacement camp in the south of the Palestinian territory killed at least 71 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 280 others were injured in the strike on Al-Mawasi camp, the ministry said, condemning a "brutal massacre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as the Israeli military pursued attacks in central Gaza with artillery fire and drone strikes, while Palestinian medics said one bombing killed a father and his three daughters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestine Red Crescent medics said the strike on a home in Deir al-Balah city killed Rital al-Raey, five, Mai, eight, Leila, nine and their 40-year-old father Mohammed al-Raey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their bodies were taken to the city's Al-Aqsa hospital, the medical workers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Civil Defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that Israeli forces had withdrawn from Tal al-Hawa and other districts, after days of fighting. It said at least 60 bodies had been found in Tal al-Hawa and a neighbouring area after the withdrawal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the agency said 60 bodies had been found in nearby Shujaiya after Israel ended an operation there. Israel's military said it had killed 150 militants in Shujaiya during a two-week operation against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday the army said operations were continuing in Gaza City as well as "targeted, intelligence-based" missions in Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of Doraemon flocked to Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday for an exhibition, in its returns to the city after 12 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The free-entry zone at the Avenue of Stars features the world's tallest 12-metre inflatable Doraemon sculpture as well as 34 different versions of Doraemon in 1:1 life size.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some fans chose to buy a ticket to access the indoor exhibition at K11 MUSEA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who came from Shenzhen, said he made a day trip to Hong Kong just for the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very excited and I'm looking forward to it. I've waited for this moment for over two months. I may come again next week for the drone show," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Doraemon fan said his family had moved to the United States, but they are back in town and felt lucky to catch the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are back in Hong Kong for the summer vacation. Tickets went on sale 2 months ago and we bought them immediately. We spent about HK$2,000 on souvenirs. We bought clothes, a popcorn bucket and a soft toy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition runs from Saturday to August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers said tickets for the indoor exhibition are sold out.

 The Chinese Olympic Committee announced on Saturday that it will send 405 athletes, including 42 Olympic champions, at an average age of 25 to the Paris Olympic Games, which will open on July 26.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The delegation is made up of 136 men and 269 women athletes, with 37-year-old women's race walker Liu Hong the oldest competitor and 11-year-old women's skateboarder Zheng Haohao the youngest.

    Turkey puts its best foot forward to Chinese investors

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shaking hands with Wang Chuanfu (L), chairman and CEO of Chinese conglomerate BYD, during a meeting in Istanbul.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey plans to draw on its geographical position and an EU customs deal to entice Chinese investors keen to access European markets tariff-free, as it recently just did with carmaker BYD.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant signed a billion-dollar deal with Ankara on Monday to open a plant in western Turkey, promising to create 5,000 jobs, a move that will help it avoid new EU tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country, at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, is in talks with other Chinese companies, Turkey's Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kacir said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to transform Turkey into a production centre for the next generation of vehicles," Kacir told private broadcaster Haberturk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister emphasised his country's selling points, including being part of the EU's customs union and having trade agreements with 28 countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chinese producers want rapid access to international markets," he said. "Investing in Turkey offers them that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ankara struck a customs deal with the EU in 1995 that enables the free flow between them of a number of goods, notably cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey became one of the leading centres of the world's automobile industry starting in the 1970s, when major carmakers including Fiat and Renault opened plants there -- with others like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai following.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under new regulations on investment incentives, BYD will be able to circumvent a new 40 percent tariff that Turkey originally imposed on electric vehicle import - Manufacturers investing in the country will be exempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish manufacturer TOGG and Chinese firm Farasis have also partnered up to produce EV batteries in Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish officials have held numerous meetings with Chinese industrialists in the last year, according to the industry ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey's foreign affairs minister Hakan Fidan visited China in June to seal a new bilateral deal, calling the countries "drivers of Asian wealth." (AFP)

    Watchdog mulls penalty to firms in data breaches

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Privacy commissioner Ada Chung says her office received nearly 100 data breach reports in the first half of 2024. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761441_1_20240713130652.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal amendments to directly penalise firms involved in data breaches are being considered, privacy commissioner Ada Chung said on Saturday, which would change the current practice of issuing an enforcement notice with a non-compliance subject to a fine or imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Chung said there is a need to empower the watchdog to penalise firms breaching the privacy ordinance to increase deterrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we are to introduce a mechanism for administrative fines, we have to look at a series of factors and then decide on the penalty amount. For example, the number of people that were affected by the data breach, because affecting 10 people is completely different from affecting 100,000 people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also we have to look at the sensitivity of the data, whether it involves medical records, as well as how the data was leaked, whether it's the fault of the company or its staff, or simply an individual case.“
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said the privacy watchdog received 97 data leak reports in the first half of the year, with seventy percent of them coming from private firms and public bodies accounting for the rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of data breaches in the second quarter rose by 70 percent, she added.

    Travel alerts on HK not grounded in facts: Eric Chan

Photo courtesy of Commercial Radio." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761430_1_20240713113020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan has hit out at certain countries and regions deciding to issue travel alerts on Hong Kong, saying the warnings are simply not grounded in facts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taiwan recently upgraded the warning to its second highest after the United States renewed the SAR's emergency status, which were widely condemned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The senior official told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that the moves were politically motivated and the SAR must rebut the accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have one mega event almost every two days on average. We also have a lot of international events. The aim is to have overseas tourists come to Hong Kong and see if it's as others say it is, that police are arresting people arbitrarily on the streets after the introduction of the national security law," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's best for people to come and see for themselves, and they will see that the situation isn't what they think it is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary also said the administration will promote patriotic education through a "soft approach", and that people must first understand the nation before forming an identity and eventually loving and safeguarding the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that there will be activities across all 18 districts on October 1, combining National Day celebrations and patriotic education.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sports minister has stressed that no system should hinder an athlete's opportunity to compete or receive training, following calls for the swimming governing body to revise its rules of competition qualifications.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong China Swimming Association came under scrutiny after a nine-year-old was reportedly barred from competing at a swimming competition due to the ranking of his club, despite meeting the qualifying time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, on Saturday said the government awaits developments of the situation, after the association said it has ways to allow the concerned athlete to compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he told a Commercial Radio programme that different sports governing bodies should review their systems, from time to time and strengthen their governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to promote the sport, as well as its development, while giving talented athletes the chance to receive professional training or compete, or even represent Hong Kong in competitions. This is a basic principle that I believe everyone agrees with, so no system should become a factor that hinders this goal," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrival of the two giant pandas gifted by the central government, the minister said the pair should be able arrive in Hong Kong by National Day, on October 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the administration would discuss whether to give the pair new names when they arrive in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The administration is aiming to have all government bureaus and departments adopt Hong Kong's own version of ChatGPT within this year, according to the technology chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Dong, the secretary for innovation, technology and industry, also said on Saturday that his bureau has been trialling the AI-powered document assistance system, which was developed by government-founded platform InnoHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The concept of the trial is that when we are using the system, problems will arise, and then we give feedback to improve it. At the same time, the more we use and train it, the better the model will be," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now, the trial has been smooth, and the system will soon be expanded to other bureaus for use. The goal is simple – to have the entire government using the system this year. And the system will eventually be open to the whole society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said the government has deliberated introducing the city's data security law, but noted that the process is rather complicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legislation is definitely within our scope of consideration, but it cannot be done overnight," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that data security law will be introduced once the data industry has matured.

    AI robot helps patients with cognitive impairment

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The AI-powered robot at Eastern Hospital can communicate with patients in Cantonese. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761414_1_20240713081443.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eastern Hospital is testing an AI-powered robot to help training patients with mild cognitive impairment, with therapists describing that as "a helpful assistant".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hospital’s occupational therapists have compiled a database of about 400 questions, covering key cognitive domains and input it into the robot, which is able to communicate with people in Cantonese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During training sessions, the robot randomly posts questions from the database. Patients can answer by talking to the robot, and they must get each of the questions right before moving on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The robot will provide hints if patients struggle with a question repeatedly and adjust the difficulty level for subsequent questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will be a very good encouragement for the patients to continue their cognitive training. Because many of the patients, if they face several failures, they may just idle the training sections away,” says senior occupational therapist Thomas Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And this situation is very common when we use the traditional one-way computer-aided training. For AI, it can eliminate these kinds of limitations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These robot-assisted sessions are typically about 20 minutes shorter than traditional face-to-face sessions, and patients who improve quickly can even do the sessions without a therapist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cheung stressed that while this helps free up some staff time, it doesn’t mean human therapists can be replaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can say this AI robot facilitates the patient's participation in training but I don't think AI robots will replace human therapists. For this AI robot it still has to depend on the input from the therapist in programming and provide different situations for this system to learn,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital currently deploys one AI-powered robot to work with a select group of geriatric and psychiatric patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it’s working on expanding the AI database and upgrading the hardware to improve the robot’s conversation skills and response time before wider use.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their upward climb on Friday, shrugging off disappointing inflation data and a poor response to bank earnings amid expectations of easing US monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US wholesale inflation rose 0.2 percent in June, more than expected, according to Labour Department data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Friday's data was not bad enough to overshadow Thursday's benign consumer price index report that boosted expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,000, just shy of a closing record set in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 also gained 0.6 percent to 5,615, along with the Nasdaq, which closed at 18,398. Both indices had dropped on Thursday, ending a multi-day stretch of records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yesterday's decline appears to be a one-off and it's not leading to more selling," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments, who considers the current dynamics a bull market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit large bank after earnings was Wells Fargo, which sank 6.0 percent as it reported lower profits due in part to a decline in net interest income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also fell more than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The air taxi startup Archer Aviation soared 10.4 percent after announcing a partnership with Southwest Airlines to provide aircraft in California. Southwest rose 2.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AT&T shed 0.2 percent after disclosing a massive data breach in which hackers stole call and message data from virtually all of its customers for six months in 2022 – around 90 million people. (AFP)

    Biden hits campaign trail as calls to quit pile up

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At least President Zelensky, a former comedian, could see the funny side of Joe Biden's gaffe at the Nato summit. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761395_1_20240713021914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden returns to the campaign trail on Friday, pushing ahead with his reelection bid after a mixed performance at a major news conference failed to silence calls for him to quit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old will give a speech bashing rival Donald Trump in Detroit in the rust-belt state of Michigan, a crucial battleground state that the Democrat must win in November's election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A defiant Biden insisted in a pivotal appearance at a Nato summit on Thursday that he would run again, and win – despite concerns about his age and health following a disastrous debate performance two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a series of gaffes, including referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump," kept Biden's fitness for a second term under the microscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, said he had met with Biden late on Thursday, as the number of members calling on the president to step aside rose to 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeffries said he and Biden "expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward" but did not give further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president has faced a steady drumbeat of Democrats calling for him to abandon his 2024 candidacy since the June 27 debate, during which Biden often lost his train of thought and appeared tired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden has obstinately dug in and insists that he can convince voters to back him despite most polls showing him trailing the criminally convicted, twice-impeached Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign event in Detroit is his fourth trip this year to the state, part of the industrial "blue wall" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that were key to his 2020 win against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's speech is expected to focus on "Project 2025", a blueprint by hardline conservatives for the first days of a Trump term that Democrats have pinned on the former president, despite the 78-year-old's denials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The press conference on Thursday appeared to buy Biden some time even if it was far from a knockout blow, with three more lawmakers urging him to quit just minutes after it finished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was the "most qualified person to run for president," rejecting calls for him to step aside before the November 5 vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He acknowledged he had to "allay fears" in the Democratic party and should "pace myself a little more" after blaming jet lag and a cold for his stumbling debate performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also fielded a series of foreign and domestic policy questions with detailed if meandering answers and relatively few slip-ups, though he did mix up Europe and Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were damaging moments on Thursday, with the Trump-Harris mixup and an earlier gaffe at the Nato summit in which he introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The concerns over Biden are also affecting Democratic donors, with Hollywood star and high-profile supporter George Clooney calling on Biden to step aside on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of other key donors have told the largest Biden campaign fund that around US$90 million in pledged donations is on hold if he carries on running, the New York Times reported on Friday. (AFP)

    Djokovic, Alcaraz to clash again in Wimbledon final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At 37, Novak Djokovic can become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he beats Carlos Alcaraz this time around. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761398_1_20240713031711.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic swept past Lorenzo Musetti on Friday to book a second successive Wimbledon final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and move one win away from a record-setting 25th Grand Slam title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just five weeks after undergoing knee surgery, seven-time Wimbledon champion Djokovic reached his 10th final at the All England Club with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 win over the Italian 25th seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz earlier defeated Daniil Medvedev 6-7 (1/7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach a fourth Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, can equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles and become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he avenges last year's dramatic five-set final loss to Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time Djokovic and Musetti met was at the French Open in June when the Serb claimed victory in a third round tie which ended at 3:07 in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, Djokovic was untroubled on his way to a 37th Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He broke for 4-2 lead in the opener and, despite surrendering the advantage and letting two set points slip in the ninth game, he broke again in the 10th to claim the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second seed was playing in his 49th Grand Slam semi-final while the 22-year-old Musetti was in his first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That experience was key as Djokovic hit back from losing serve in the opening game of the second set to level in the sixth before dominating the tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break in the opening game of the third set launched him on his way to victory against a demoralised Musetti, who at least had the consolation of saving three match points before Djokovic completed his progress to yet another Wimbledon final. (AFP)

    UK to release thousands of inmates due to overcrowding

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Britain's new justice minister Shabana Mahmood says failure to act now could lead to "the collapse of the criminal justice system." Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761397_1_20240713024159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of prisoners are to be released early from September in order to prevent the "collapse" of the prisons system, the UK's new justice minister announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shabana Mahmood said failure to do so risked the "total breakdown of law and order," with just 700 places left for men, and jails operating at 99 percent capacity since 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England and Wales have the highest per capita prison population in Western Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said this week that urgent action was required, as prisons were at "breaking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release initiative would not apply to violent offenders serving more than four years, sex offenders and those in prison for domestic abuse offences as well as those on life sentences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood, appointed last week after Labour's general election win, warned in dramatic language that if prisons ran out of cell space, there could be "van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops and setting neighbourhoods alight," she said in a speech at a prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood accused the previous Conservative government of a "dereliction of duty" regarding the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her comments echoed Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who earlier told reporters while attending a Nato summit in the United States that the ousted Tories were guilty of "gross irresponsibility."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of the problem was worse than we thought," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood's Conservative predecessor in the post, Alex Chalk, had reportedly pressed prime minister Rishi Sunak to impose similar measures before the election, but was overruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Labour's plans, prisoners who are eligible for automatic release after serving half their sentence will be freed earlier than the normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plans involve a temporary reduction of how long prisoners must serve behind bars, from 50 percent to 40 percent of their sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The releases will start in September to give the Prison and Probation Service time to plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood also announced the recruitment of 1,000 additional trainee probation officers by next March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total number of prisoners hit over 87,505 on Friday – of whom 83,755 were men – leaving just 1,451 spaces available, official figures showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of 2023, the average occupancy rate in men's prisons had "routinely been higher than 99 percent," according to the Ministry of Justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say the prison system needs a buffer of around 1,425 cell spaces in men's prisons at all time to deal with sudden influxes of inmates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six new prisons to create an extra 20,000 places are being built – of which about 10,000 will be ready by the end of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Prison Governors' Association (PGA) said it welcomed the speed of the new measures while demanding a "full review" and that "the public must never be placed in this position again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PGA chairman Mark Fairhurst said the measures would free up around 4,500-5,000 more spaces and give prisons around 12 to 18 months before further steps would be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Prison Reform Trust chief executive Pia Sinha said ministers "had the good sense to listen to the advice of its officials and introduce further emergency measures." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 16 students were killed on Friday when a school in central Nigeria collapsed on pupils taking exams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trapped students cried for help under the rubble after the Saint Academy school in Jos North district of Plateau State fell in on classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents desperately looked for their children as rescue workers tried to reach the victims with heavy machinery. Images from the scene showed crowds gathering round a caved-in concrete building and heaps of debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have so far only said "several students" were killed but a witness saw five dead bodies in one hospital morgue and 11 in another. All were wearing school uniforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his mother at his hospital bedside, injured student Wulliya Ibrahim said: "I entered the class not more than five minutes, when I heard a sound, and the next thing is I found myself here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are many in the class, we are writing our exams," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Emergency Management Agency said the two-storey building housing Saint Academy collapsed killing "several students."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had completed the search and rescue operation and would provide details later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chika Obioha, a resident at the scene, said he saw at least eight bodies at the site and that dozens more had been injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone is helping out to see if we can rescue more people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 15 rescued and injured students were admitted to the Our Lady of Apostles Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse but residents said it came after three days of heavy rains in Plateau. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England great James Anderson said he felt "really proud" after bringing down the curtain on a remarkable Test career with a thumping win over the West Indies at Lord's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His final appearance before international retirement saw the 41-year-old paceman take a typically frugal 3-32 in 16 overs as the West Indies were dismissed for just 136 on Friday to give England victory by an innings and 114 runs inside three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England selectors had already agreed with Anderson that this first of a three-match series would represent his farewell to national on-field service as they look to rebuild ahead of the 2025/26 Ashes series in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anderson, now set to mentor England's quicks for the rest of the season, bowed out with a remarkable 704 wickets from 188 Tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only spinners Shane Warne (708 Test wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800) have enjoyed more bowling success at this level, with India batting hero Sachin Tendulkar (200 matches) the lone cricketer to have played more Tests than Anderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been quite an amazing week," Anderson told Sky Sports. "I've been overwhelmed with the reaction of the crowd and everyone around the ground, and the lads as well. I'm just proud of what I've achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously this morning was quite emotional with the two teams lined up, and the reaction from the crowd was pretty special. I'm still trying to hold them (tears) back now but I think I am just really proud," added Anderson after ending his Test career where it started – with a debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's in 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for 20-odd years is an incredible effort, especially for a fast bowler, so I'm just happy that I've made it this far, happy that I've been lucky enough to stay injury-free pretty much throughout my career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for England is the best job in the world and I've been privileged to do it for a long time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Ben Stokes hailed Anderson by saying: "He has just been an incredible inspiration to so many people...The amount of games and the amount of wickets he's taken are just absolutely phenomenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes you can be lost for words but if you gave me 15 minutes I wouldn't be able to compliment him enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a sense of a torch being passed at Lord's, with debutant fast bowler Gus Atkinson named player of the match following a sensational haul of 12-106.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By taking 12 wickets in his first Test, he managed something Anderson was unable to achieve in 188, with the Lancashire swing specialist's best match return at this level 11-71 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an incredible week," said Atkinson. "I just want to say thanks to Jimmy. Playing here in his last Test has been incredible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Surrey quick, asked if he had idolised Anderson as a child, replied: "A hundred percent. Growing up Jimmy was someone I would come to Lord's and watch. I was standing at mid-off thinking I had seen that so many times on the TV. It was amazing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite summed up many an opposition batsman's view of Anderson by saying: "He is a legend of the game. I won't miss him at all!" (AFP)

    US producer inflation higher than anticipated in June

<div class="itemFullText">
 US wholesale prices picked up more than expected in June due to service costs, the government reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.2 percent last month, while an initially-reported decline in May was revised upwards, said the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures come after a cooler than expected consumer inflation reading, which fanned hopes of the US central bank cutting interest rates as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve has been battling to bring stubborn inflation back to its longer-term two percent target by keeping rates high, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted "modest" progress on prices recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, government data showed the consumer price index – a key gauge of inflation – rose 3.0 percent from a year ago, a slowdown from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said the latest PPI data is unlikely to worry the Fed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the PPI report, a 0.6 percent increase in services costs bumped the overall index higher, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, PPI rose 2.6 percent in June, the largest gain since increasing 2.7 percent in March 2023, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an underlying measure stripping out food, energy and trade services was unchanged in June after a 0.2 percent rise in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some analysts expect the Fed could signal in its July meeting that it intends to lower rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although slightly hotter than expected, a modest rise in the producer price index for June still keeps input prices on a supportive path for cooler inflation prints ahead," said Ben Ayers, senior economist for Nationwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a media interview on Thursday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said: "I do think with the incoming information on inflation, growth and the labour market, some policy adjustments are likely to be warranted." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday led a number of senior officials to attend the Hong Kong-Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He told delegates with the SAR government enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year, Hong Kong could now focus on economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the areas of co-operation, the SAR government said it was studying with its Shenzhen counterparts on ways to build a clinical trial co-operative platform within the Lok Ma Chau Loop area, also known as the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it would set up a clinical trial institute in the Loop area by the end of this year, with the aim of providing trials for the entire Greater Bay Area population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said Hong Kong and its bay area counterparts would work to build an international medical innovation hub in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute was first mentioned in Chief Executive John Lee's policy address last year.

 A Russian regional airliner carrying three crew members crashed in a forested area near Moscow on Friday, killing all on board, Russian news agencies reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plane was a Superjet 100 regional jet and was carrying out a "test flight" before crashing near the Russian city of Kolomna, the TASS news agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cause of the crash was not clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mash, a Telegram channel close to Russian law enforcement, said the plane had been on a test flight after repairs and belonged to Gazpromavia, an airline owned by gas giant Gazprom. (Agencies)
