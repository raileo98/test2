    <![CDATA[<img alt="Robert F Kennedy Jr announces that he's dropping his presidential run. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767443_1_20240824033757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20 percent of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, US President John F Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy said on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts. (Reuters)

    In Kyiv, Modi says diplomacy can end Ukraine crisis

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Narendra Modi is greeted by Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the Indian leader makes a historic visit to Kyiv. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767440_1_20240824015244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday to sit down for talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine and offered to act as a friend to help bring peace as the two leaders met in wartime Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history comes at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in Februaru 2022, with Moscow making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The optics closely resembled the Indian leader's visit to Moscow last month where he called for peace and embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, angering Ukraine where a Russian missile strike hit a children's hospital on the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The road to resolution can only be found through dialogue and diplomacy. And we should move in that direction without wasting any time. Both sides should sit together to find a way out of this crisis," Modi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to assure you that India is ready to play an active role in any efforts towards peace. If I can play any role in this personally, I will do that, I want to assure you as a friend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what Kyiv made of his remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, which traditionally has close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war, but also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both leaders described Modi's visit as "historic" in their statements, in which Modi spoke second and Zelenskiy did not have an opportunity to respond to the call for dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskiy said that "the matter of ending the war and a just peace are the priority for Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that talks were out of the question after Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6. (Reuters)

    UK police drop poll date bet probe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An aide to former British PM Rishi Sunak was among those accused of placing bets on the election date. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767438_1_20240824011046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police announced on Friday that a probe into betting on the date of the last general election had ended, saying the bar for misconduct had not been met.
 <br>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said in late June it would investigate a "small number" of bets placed on the timing of last month's elections, as part of a joint probe with the gambling watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scandal overshadowed the latter stages of campaigning ahead of the July 5 poll, after it emerged senior Conservative officials and one of then-prime minister Rishi Sunak's aides had placed bets shortly before he announced the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met also arrested one of its officers on suspicion of misconduct in public office over election betting claims, while six other officers were identified as having placed bets on its date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission launched an investigation into whether any broke laws on "cheating" while the Met opened a separate inquiry into whether other criminal offences had been committed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While political bets are allowed in the UK, using insider knowledge to make them is against the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Britain's biggest police force announced its criminal investigation had concluded with no action being taken, including against the officer who had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met said the "high bar" for proving misconduct in public office had not been met, following advice from the country's prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission investigation remains ongoing and could still result in criminal charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile the Met's internal watchdog unit is continuing to investigate the seven officers alleged to have placed bets on the election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These allegations caused a significant dent in public confidence during the election campaign and it was right that they were investigated to explore all possible offences," Detective Superintendent Katherine Goodwin said in a statement. (AFP)

    Fed's Powell says time has come to cut rates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell arrives at the Jackson Hole talks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767436_1_20240824003034.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday offered an explicit endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job market would be unwelcome and expressing confidence that inflation was within reach of the US central bank's 2 percent target.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased," Powell said in a highly anticipated speech to the Kansas City Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referencing the two goals that the Fed is tasked by Congress to achieve, Powell said his "confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent," after rising to about 7 percent during the Covid-19 pandemic, while unemployment is increasing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Powell said the jump of nearly a percentage point in the unemployment rate over the past year was due largely to rising labour supply and slowed hiring, not increased layoffs, he also was emphatic that the Fed wanted to prevent any further erosion – his prior talk of labour market "pain" as necessary to control inflation now a thing of the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current unemployment rate of 4.3 percent is roughly at the level Fed officials feel is consistent with stable inflation over the longer run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labour market conditions," Powell said. "We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labour market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders on Friday continued to bet on a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed's September 17-18 meeting, but after Powell's remarks priced in about a one-in-three chance of a bigger half-percentage-point cut, up from a little more than a one-in-four probability earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell was clear about the first rate cut, but not so much about the next ones, so I don't think he'll be exploding out of the blocks with a 50-basis-point cut," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "I think slow and steady is how the Fed wants to pace this early part of the easing." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer was injured during an operation on Princess Margaret Road on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video circulating online, swarms of officers had surrounded a northbound silver vehicle opposite Hung Hom Divisional Police Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of them had drawn their guns and demanded the driver pull over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the driver refused to cooperate, and tried to break free from the road block by jolting back and forth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver eventually came to a halt after colliding with another vehicle, before being apprehended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One officer who was hit in the waist was helped up by other colleagues, and led onto a police van.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second driver caught in the incident suffered neck injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All northbound lanes of the major thoroughfare were sealed off at around 8.40pm, causing severe traffic disruption.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed the success of his administration in attracting foreign talent and businesses to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video message as part of his Policy Address consultation, Mr Lee said officials have gone all out to look for new opportunities over the past year, despite facing many challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Hong Kong is going through economic transformation, we have continuously strengthened our efforts to grab talent and attract enterprises and capital to Hong Kong," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With a special focus on innovation and technology, we pursue development in new quality productive forces and reinforce our status as an international financial centre, aviation hub and trade centre. We will build Hong Kong into a global hub for high-calibre talent and strive for economic growth and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured a number of people who decided to set up shop in Hong Kong recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Daniel Seah, the chief executive of Los Angeles-based Digital Domain, an Oscar-winning production house specialising in visual effects for movies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I deal with officials in Hong Kong, they are clear about what this place needs. They are also clear about what our company needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A research and development base is most crucial for a company, especially for us since we are built on technology."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of July, Hong Kong has engaged over 100 strategic and innovation and technology enterprises which agreed to set up or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have generated investment of HK$52 billion and created more than 15,000 jobs.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A union group has called on the government to do more to protect the rights of digital platform workers after pointing to a survey that it said highlighted their plight, especially those who suffered work-related injuries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who's also chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, proposed setting up a committee to allow workers to better reflect their views and give them greater bargaining power, similar to what Singapore has done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said government officials, employer and employee representatives as well as union members could sit on the committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their [the workers'] representatives can participate in the committee and they can discuss the details, for example the amount of each order, and... the time limit of receiving the order online," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent survey jointly conducted by the group and the Federation of Hong Kong Transportation and Logistics Industry Unions, just under a quarter of about 360 interviewees – who are mainly courier or food delivery workers – said they had been injured at work, but only 13 percent of them received compensation and most were not satisfied with the amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions said the workers lack bargaining power because a majority of them are self-employed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam also pointed out that even though some companies would purchase casualty insurance, it is not enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that the Labour Department and the government can encourage the platform companies to purchase the insurance, maybe the compensation is similar to the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, to provide better protection and compensation, to also include, for example, support them for the medical treatment in hospitals or clinics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said the authorities should also look into requiring the companies to offer workers retirement protection.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 14 people were killed, 16 others injured and several more believed to be missing after a bus carrying dozens of Indian pilgrims drove off a key highway on Friday in Nepal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said the bus veered off Prithvi Highway and rolled towards a fast-flowing river, stopping on the rocky bank just shy of the rushing, murky water. The top part of the bus was ripped, but the wreckage did not plunge into the Marsyangdi River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An armed police spokesperson said that, among those pulled out of from the bus, 14 were declared dead and 16 were injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials could not yet say how many more were missing or the exact number of people on the bus when it crashed, but they estimated there were some four dozen on board at the time of the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police and army rescuers were helping to pull people from the wreckage near Abukhaireni, a town about 120 kilometres west of the capital, Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bus from neighbouring Indian town of Gorakhpur was heading toward Kathmandu from the resort town of Pokhara on Friday when it drove off the highway midway in the journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, two buses were swept by landslides not too far from Friday's accident site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 65 people on board those two buses, only three survived and only about half the bodies were recovered. The wreckage of those buses have not been found yet but authorities have continued to search.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bus accidents in Nepal are mostly due to poorly maintained roads and vehicles and much of the country is covered by mountains with narrow roads. (AP)

    Faulty confirmations behind hospital feeding tube case

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An “uncommon” false pH test result and an inaccurate medical image were to blame for a blunder at Queen Elizabeth Hospital involving a patient's feeding tube being inserted into his airway and left undetected in June this year, hospital bosses said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They also said the 61-year-old male patient, who was paralysed, remained under intensive care in a critical state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said a nurse replaced the nasogastric tube for the patient in an orthopaedic ward as part of normal procedures on June 16, before another nurse reinserted the apparatus the same evening. But the patient's condition deteriorated around a day later, with doctors finding the tube in his left bronchus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Kam-shing, a doctor who led a root cause analysis panel, said the medics had performed pH tests and an X-ray to check the position of the tube, before proceeding to feed the patient fluids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sample tested came back acidic, which normally means the nasogastric tube is in the stomach, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, which is a little bit uncommon, the nasogastric tube has gone via the left bronchus into the left pleural space, which is the space between the lungs and the thoracic cage," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of [the patient's] chest infection, there is some fluid accumulating in the pleural cavity, which is probably infected. When the pleural fluid is probably infected, it will become acidic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who's also the chief executive of Kwong Wah Hospital, said the houseman checking the X-ray was likely inexperienced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the things that usually the doctor will look at is the tip of the nasogastric tube. Whenever it is in a standard position, then it is one of the factors that we can use to judge whether the nasogastric tube is in the correct space," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, because the chest X-ray doesn't show clearly the tip of the nasogastric tube, we think that the doctor involved probably doesn't have enough clinical experience to make sure that the nasogastric tube is indeed in the correct space."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for why the tube was left undetected, Tang said patients normally would show symptoms only after one to two litres had been accumulated in the cavity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel suggested reviewing the Hospital Authority's internal guidelines on inserting nasogastric tubes and consider whether to perform an X-ray examination on high-risk patients before feeding them liquids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also proposed having the attending doctor review previous clinical results in complicated circumstances, as well as coming up with a more standardised medical imaging procedure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, Queen Elizabeth Hospital's chief executive, apologised to the patient and his family, saying authorities would follow up on the panel's suggestions as soon as possible and provide training and assessment to the medics involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the houseman should be held accountable, Cheung said the doctor was part of the team and that "the responsibility ultimately lies with the hospital".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The houseman had finished the internship at the orthopaedic unit and officials would follow up according to the panel's report and established procedures, he added.

    Commerce Ministry hears views on auto tariff hikes

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Commerce on Friday convened a meeting to hear opinions and suggestions from industry and academic experts on increasing tariffs on the import of fuel-powered cars with large-displacement engines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, representatives from relevant industry organisations, research institutions and automotive companies attended the talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Commission said earlier it planned to slap five-year import duties of up to 36 percent on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), unless Beijing can offer Brussels alternative solutions to end their row over state subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rates were revised slightly under a draft plan this week
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels already hit EVs imported from China with hefty provisional tariffs last month -- on top of current duties of 10 percent -- after an anti-subsidy probe found they were unfairly undermining European rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariffs are subject to the approval of the European Union member states. A final decision must be made by early November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has filed an appeal with the World Trade Organisation over the EV tariffs, calling them unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has launched investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products amid heightened trade tensions. (Agencies)

    HKMA to look into SMEs' struggles with bank repayments

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Arthur Yuen, will lead a new task force to look into small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are having trouble with banks over their loan repayments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This task force was formed in response to calls from small businesses urging lenders to stop requesting early repayments or recalling loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives from the Hong Kong Association of Banks on Friday morning, HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said the new body would aim at helping individual SMEs resolve their funding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each case has its own background and uniqueness, and each case could be handled differently. I would encourage business chambers or companies to refer cases to the Authority immediately, if they hear or see any firms having difficulties, so that they can be dealt with by the task force and resolved with banks quickly,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another press briefing, the co-chairperson of the task force, Arthur Yuen, said the HKMA has received only a small number of complaints from SMEs which required its intervention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen added the banking sector has been supporting SMEs, noting that lenders have allowed around 4,000 small businesses to delay their loan repayments since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said a potential interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month could help struggling small firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest burden that they (SMEs) are facing right now is perhaps much higher than three years ago,” he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's really an expectational issue, the forward-looking, where interest rates are heading that would help banks in assessing the repayment ability of a corporate model, including SMEs, because then they will have the interest rate outlook. They fit the interest rate outlook into their credit models, and that would definitely be helpful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In face of concerns over the tightening policy of property loans, Yuen said the HKMA has urged lenders to complete their vetting requests for such loans within two weeks, unless applicants fail to provide the adequate information needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) welcomed the establishment of the task force, saying the new group would help SMEs in acquiring capital and promoting Hong Kong's economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said small businesses still need more support to overcome these difficult times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government may consider restarting the 100 percent guaranteed loan and also the payment holiday scheme. That is just pay the interest without repaying the principal, like for a period of 12 months," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all hope that (in) 2025, things will improve. And I hope as the economic situation improves, cash flow for the companies will also improve."

    'More support, funding needed for HK Esports'

<div class="itemFullText">
 More support is needed for talented Hong Kong gamers who often have to pay their own way to compete overseas, said the founding president of the Esports Association of Hong Kong, China on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eric Yeung made the comment after 16-year-old Cheng Yip-kai took home the city's first Pokémon GO world championship title after booking his own trip to Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now unfortunately, most of the games are commercially running for those competitions, rather than [falling] within the traditional sports framework," he told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think it's a bit difficult [using] the traditional funding way to fund them and to support them to go to compete [against] others internationally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said Esports can be integrated with other industries to drive growth, noting the lack of a professional league and competitions in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Esports itself is not a standalone industry. But rather, in Hong Kong we could work closely together with the innovation and technology industry as well as the traditional sport industry in order to groom a better result for the Esports industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the success of blockbuster game "Wukong" - or "Monkey King" - marked a milestone for China's Esports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game, based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, is the first triple-A video game in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major difference [between] those AAA games and those traditional Esports games is the investment. When we are talking about the AAA level games, it's like shooting a movie - we're talking about maybe even hundreds of millions dollars of investment for a single game," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investment for a traditional mobile game is much lower."

    Plan to upgrade Alibaba's HK listing approved

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shareholders of e-commerce giant Alibaba approved a plan to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767339_1_20240823123627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Alibaba on Friday said it would upgrade its Hong Kong-listed shares to primary status, opening it up to China's huge army of investors that could potentially rake in billions of dollars for the firm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by shareholders during its annual general meeting on Thursday will provide a much-needed boost to the firm, which has underperformed the market in recent years due to to weak consumption and after a crackdown by Beijing on the tech industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to announce that the voluntary conversion of our secondary listing to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will become effective on August 28, 2024," the company announced on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, which is also listed in New York, had flagged the idea two years ago amid worries about a regulatory drive by US authorities as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington, though that was later put off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba has been primarily traded in New York since 2014 and remained dual-listed after its notable return to Hong Kong through a second listing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the firm's shares in Hong Kong are down about 75 percent from their peak in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A conversion to primary status in Hong Kong could pave way for Alibaba to enter a cross-border scheme that allows investors in Shenzhen and Shanghai to trade Hong Kong-listed shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would open it up to China's more than 200 million investors and could see capital inflows of up to US$19.5 billion in the first six months of inclusion, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba this month reported a 29 percent fall in quarterly profit as it battles sluggish activity among China's consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uncertainty about Alibaba's future development has persisted since Beijing scuttled a planned initial public offering of the company's financial services arm, Ant Group, in late 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancelled listing -- which would likely have been the biggest in history -- was followed a month later by an announcement that Alibaba was under formal investigation in China for alleged monopolistic practices. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Kamala Harris called on Americans to join her to “chart a new way forward” as she accepted the Democratic nomination on Thursday, arguing her personal story and her career as a prosecutor made her uniquely qualified to protect their interests and beat Republican candidate Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking the stage to a thunderous standing ovation at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris sought to introduce herself to the American public and outline her vision for leading the nation for the next four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' address in Chicago caps a whirlwind eight weeks in American politics and manifests the stunning reversal of Democratic fortunes just 75 days until Election Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party leaders who had publicly despaired over President Joe Biden's candidacy after his disastrous debate against Trump in June, were jubilant both at the historic nature of Harris' candidacy which has boosted their hopes for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Harris became the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to accept a major party's presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If elected, she would become the first female US president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected. But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris talked about being raised primarily by her mother in San Francisco's East Bay after her parents divorced, and being raised as well by friends and caregivers who were “family by love.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also detailed a key part of her political origin story, when Wanda, her best friend from high school, confided in her that she was being abused by her stepfather and came to live with Harris' family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor. To protect people like Wanda,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outlining her career as a prosecutor, state attorney general, senator and now vice president, Harris said, “My entire career I’ve only had one client: the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said Trump has only ever acted in the interests of "the only client he has ever had: himself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she took the stage, she saw a sea of female delegates and Democratic supporters wearing white — the colour of women’s suffrage — the movement that culminated with American women securing the right to vote in 1920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also pledged to get a Gaza ceasefire deal completed and said as US president she would stand with Ukraine and not "cozy up" to dictators like Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done." (Agencies)

    'Replace Covid facilities with carpark at cruise port'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jeff Bent has revised his earlier forecast and says Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767319_1_20240823104145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday called for the government to remove unused Covid facilities near the site and build an open-air carpark to improve transport links to the facility.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jeff Bent, the managing director of World Wide Cruise Terminals, was commenting on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme after the terminal welcomed the only cruise ship to dock there this month, the Norwegian Spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent revised his earlier forecast and said Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we're expecting about 100 total ship calls... The cruise business is going to be slow this year and next, as we work our way out of the post-Covid trough," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used to have a home-based carrier, a cruise line based in Hong Kong that went out of business and Hong Kong saved its air carrier. We did not save our cruise line... We're now sort of dealing with cruise lines that come from time to time and on occasion, but are not year round based here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent said the unused Covid facilities were a "detraction" of the cruise terminal, and the government should remove them and make use of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Where all those Covid facilities are now, it would be quite easy to have a large open-air carpark there. I think at a minimum, that would be a big boon because we know that 45 percent of Hong Kong people who take a cruise have a car. Eighty-five percent of those would like to drive themselves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If those people can drive themselves, then they will not be fighting for a limited taxi supply with the out-of-town guests. So there are some quick fixes that should be put in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government could allow cab drivers to impose a surcharge for pick-ups at the terminal to attract more taxis to the port.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian cyclist Ben O'Connor soloed to a stunning victory in stage six of the Vuelta a España on Thursday, taking the red jersey from three-time winner Primoz Roglic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rider and Gijs Leemreize attacked from a breakaway group before O'Connor later left the Dutchman behind with 27 kilometres to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor opened up a defendable lead of four minutes 51 seconds in the general classification ahead of veteran Roglic, as the peloton came in well over six minutes down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt a little bit in my own world today. I just went for it, I felt today was just a day to seize my opportunity and I laid it all out there," O'Connor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I could win this stage from the start – it's pretty special when you can just go out and crush it like that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor became the fifth Australian to win stages at all three Grand Tours after winning at the Giro in 2020 and at the Tour de France in 2021. (AFP)

    Chelsea give Maresca first win in Conference League

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The victory is Maresca's first with Chelsea. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767297_1_20240823082205.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea secured their first victory under new coach Enzo Maresca with a 2-0 victory over Servette in their Conference League play-off round first leg on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hosts struggled to break down their opponents in the first half at Stamford Bridge before Christopher Nkunku put them in front with a 50th-minute penalty, just his fourth goal for the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guiu somehow contrived to miss an open goal a few minutes later, but Noni Madueke moved Chelsea closer to a group-stage place ahead of next week's second leg by firing home from Enzo Fernandez's pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiemoko Ouattara almost pulled one back for Swiss side Servette late on when his deflected strike hit the crossbar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a welcome win for Chelsea after suffering a 2-0 loss in Maresca's debut game against Manchester City at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Blues are making their return to European competition after finishing sixth in the Premier League last season under Mauricio Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are learning how to manage the game," said Maresca, who led Leicester to promotion to the Premier League last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was important to win the game with nine changes. There were many good things," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a scare for Chelsea, as key player Cole Palmer went down the dug-out holding the back of his leg at full-time after coming on as a second-half substitute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cole felt something but he looks fine. Hopefully it is no problem and he can be available for Sunday's game against Wolves," Maresca said. (AFP)

    Canada to order rail companies to resume operations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Canadian government moved quickly on Thursday to end an unprecedented rail stoppage, announcing it would ask the country's industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order that could come in a few days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Canada's top two railroads had locked out more than 9,000 unionised workers earlier in the day, triggering a simultaneous rail stoppage that business groups said could inflict hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon told reporters he was acting "to ensure that the activities of both of these rail companies immediately resume" and said he was referring the matter to the board for binding arbitration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MacKinnon said he was confident the board would issue a back-to-work order within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I assume that the trains will be running within days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies – Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City – and the Teamsters union blamed each other for the work stoppage after multiple rounds of talks failed to yield an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision marked a change of mind by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which had long made clear its desire to see the matter settled at the bargaining table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We gave negotiations every possible opportunity to succeed ... but we have an impasse here," said MacKinnon. "And that is why we have come to this decision today." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All three major US stock indexes lost ground on Thursday, weighed by technology shares, as Treasury yields rose on easing recession fears and global central bank officials convened at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The so-called Magnificent Seven megacap growth stocks weighed heaviest on the tech-laden Nasdaq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There doesn't appear to be any kind of clear catalyst as to what's driving this sell-off," Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People may be trying to square positions a little bit ahead of Nvidia (earnings) next week, or risk-out ahead of (US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell's Jackson Hole speech tomorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Central bank officials from around the world have gathered in Jackson Hole for the annual Economic Symposium. Investors will be laser focused on Powell's address on Friday for clues on the timing and extent of the Fed's policy easing cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell is expected to assure the markets that the Fed will cut rates in September, Ladner said. "He'll be coy with the question about whether it's going to be a 25 or 50 basis point cut, but will probably try to lead the market towards 25."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will say he expects to start slow but will also emphasize that if they do see any further weakness in the labor market they can speed things up," Ladner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News of increasing US jobless claims, following Wednesday's sharply lower benchmark payrolls revision, appear to confirm the labour market is less robust than expected and is gradually softening. This soothed recession fears while bolstering the case for a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September policy meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sentiment was echoed in remarks on Thursday from Kansas City Fed President Frank Schmid, Boston Fed President Susan Collins, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, all of whom indicated that a rate-cutting phase is shortly forthcoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What Fed officials are saying is a rate cut is definitely on the table, but there's still time between now and September and data can move things," Martin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.43 percent, to 40,713. The S&P 500 lost 0.89 percent, at 5,571 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.67 percent to 17,619. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities confirmed late on Thursday that five Chinese nationals were among nine people who died when a small plane crashed minutes after taking off from Bangkok’s main airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports in Thailand say the dead included children aged 12 and 13, as well as three adults in their 40s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other four victims were Thai nationals, including two pilots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok said Thai authorities had confirmed the death of five Chinese nationals, and it was seeking further information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Immigration Department said no SAR residents were involved in the tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports say the jet took off from Bangkok’s main Suvarnabhumi Airport at 2.46pm. Air traffic control lost radio and radar contact with the aircraft 11 minutes later, when it was an estimated 35 kilometres southeast of the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai media said rescuers found no survivors at the crash site in a mangrove swamp in Chachoengsao province about 40 kilometres from the airport. Rescue teams continued their work into the night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cessna Caravan C208B operated by the Thai Flying Service Company had been bound for the coastal province of Krabi. (Additional reporting by AP, Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court on Thursday revived part of an Arizona voter law requiring documented proof of US citizenship to register to vote, in response to a request from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The justices in a 5-4 ruling agreed to reinstate a provision of the law after a federal judge blocked it in response to legal challenges by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration and advocacy groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision comes before the November 5 election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is facing off against Republican former President Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud.

  <br/>
  Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature adopted new restrictions on voter registration in 2022. The law requires applicants who submit a federal registration form to provide evidence of US citizenship to vote in presidential elections or vote by mail in any federal election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter registrants who use a separate, state-created form face even tighter restrictions. Without proof of US citizenship, state applications are rejected in their entirety, and officials who fail to do so face a minor felony charge under the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court's ruling revived the restriction related to the state voter registration form, but kept intact a judicial decision blocking the provision that sought to tighten limits on the federal form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts joined with fellow conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch to grant Republicans' request in part, though Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the entire request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would have denied the request in full. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner

<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal on Thursday ratified President Nicolas Maduro's victory in the July 28 presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The supreme tribunal has reviewed material from the electoral authority and agrees that Maduro won the election, court president Caryslia Rodriguez said, adding the decision cannot be appealed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The electoral material assessed is certified unobjectionably and the results of the presidential election of July 28 released by the national electoral council, where Nicolas Maduro was elected president of the republic, are validated," said Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electoral authority has said since the night of the election that Maduro won just over half of votes, though it has not published full tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has published online what it says are 83 percent of voting machine tallies, which give its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez a hearty 67 percent support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Western countries have urged full publication of results, while Russia, China and others have congratulated Maduro on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme court would be in violation of separation of powers rules in the constitution if it were to carry out any electoral functions, thus making its ruling null, the opposition said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ratification gives Maduro, who took office in 2013, another six-year term, set to begin in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president, a long-time ruling party official before he rose to the presidency, had asked the court to verify the results. The court's judges summoned all the candidates to hand over the copies of voting machine tallies they are entitled to by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez did not attend the summons. The opposition says the court, though constitutionally independent, operates as an arm of the ruling party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition's failure to hand over its copies and Gonzalez's non-appearance are "blatant disrespect", Rodriguez said, and exposes him to sanctions, though she did not specify what kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 23 protesters have been killed at anti-government demonstrations since the election, and some 2,400 arrested, according to the United Nations. Maduro says the demonstrators are extremists. (Reuters)

    Indonesia shelves elections shake-up amid protests

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters clash with police outside the Parliament in Jakarta. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767270_1_20240822233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament shelved planned changes to electoral laws on Thursday after protesters in the capital set fires and faced down tear gas and water cannon over legislation they say would weaken opponents of the outgoing president and his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislature, dominated by supporters of outgoing President Joko Widodo and his successor, Prabowo Subianto, was scheduled to vote to reverse changes to election laws made by the constitutional court, a ruling that effectively reopened a chance for a vocal government critic to run in regional elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties backing Prabowo had earlier this week rallied behind a single candidate for the influential post of Jakarta governor, killing off chances of the president-elect's rival, Anies Baswedan, from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anies at the time needed the backing from a party or a coalition of parties with at least 20 percent of seats in the local parliament, under rules for regional elections in place since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tuesday's Constitutional Court ruling had lowered the threshold to under 10 percent, giving Anies a chance to be nominated by the only party that has not named a candidate, PDIP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national parliament had sought to return to the previous threshold, contradicting the country's highest court in a move critics said would favour the outgoing president and his family, and the incoming government, as they consolidate power and freeze out any opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a republic. It's a democracy, but if its leadership is decided by one person, or an oligarchy, we can't accept that," said 29-year-old teacher Afif Sidik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, deputy parliament speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad said that deliberations would be resumed by the incoming parliament, meaning there would be no change for this year's regional elections, scheduled for November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means Anies will be able to seek the Jakarta governor's office if PDIP nominates him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parliament decision came as security forces fired tear gas and water cannon as protesters breached and set ablaze part of the gates of parliament, while demonstrations broke out across the country against the election law changes. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at a hotel in South Korea has killed seven people and injured 12 others, fire authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fire began on the eighth floor of the nine-story hotel in Bucheon, just west of the capital Seoul at around 7.40pm on Thursday, before being put out in about two hours, according to the interior ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven people died, mostly guests, and 12 were sent to hospitals for treatment, including three in critical condition, said Lee Sang-don, an official at the Bucheon fire station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those killed were a couple who jumped out the windows onto an air mattress installed in front of the building, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was unfolded normally but appeared to have flipped over when they jumped down," he told a televised briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities were looking into the exact cause of the incident, adding there were no sprinklers inside, which was not mandatory when the building was completed in 2003, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Lee Sang-min ordered all-out rescue efforts by mobilising all available resources, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 70 vehicles and 160 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, Yonhap news agency said, citing provincial fire authorities.

    Panda twins gaining weight, still fragile: Ocean Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Thursday said the giant panda twins born a week ago were gradually stabilising and gaining weight, with the animal's iconic black patches starting to show on parts of the cubs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it also said the pair remained fragile and were being monitored by mainland experts and the park's animal care team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said the female cub weighs around 172 grammes and her younger brother about 168 grammes, and black spots were "vaguely visible" on their eyes, ears and shoulders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are both feeding and defecating normally under the assistance of experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. The twin cubs are also displaying healthy appetites by drinking up to 10 grammes of milk per meal, six times per day," Ocean Park said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the two cubs are stabilising, they are still fragile and are under 24-hour intensive care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said caretakers were supporting the mother panda, Ying Ying, with her post-labour recovery, and experts were trying to milk her for the cubs to consume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying has been improving her caring and nursing behaviours, the park added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth to the twins last Thursday, which was also the eve of her 19th birthday, or the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Italian coast guard on Thursday said the body of British tech magnate Mike Lynch was among those recovered off the coast of Sicily from the wreckage of a superyacht.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One woman remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies of Lynch, who had been celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with his family and the people who had defended him at trial in the United States, and five others were recovered by rescue crews following Monday's tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bayesian, a 56-metre British-flagged yacht, went down in a storm early Monday as it was moored about a kilometre offshore. Civil protection officials said they believe the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, and sank quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators are now looking at why the Bayesian sank, killing at least six people. A seventh remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen of the 22 people aboard survived, including a mother who reported holding her one-year-old baby over the waves to save her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers have struggled to find the bodies in the yacht’s hull on the seabed 50 metres underwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would need a crystal ball to know when we'll be able to find the next body," said Luca Cari, spokesperson for the fire rescue service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's very difficult to move inside the wreckage. Moving just one metre can take up to 24 hours,” Cari said. (AP)

Photo courtesy of the Hong Kong Jockey Club" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767229_1_20240822172433.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It is up to the Hong Kong Jockey Club to call the shots on how to use a parcel of land it owns in upmarket Happy Valley, the government said on Thursday, after the non-profit body was given the green light to redevelop its sports complex there into a residential site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But a lawmaker said the charity and gaming organisation should provide details on the intended use of housing blocks at 48 Shan Kwong Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Buildings Department had in June approved the club's plan for constructing three 21-storey residential buildings with a total gross floor area of nearly 486,000 square feet, as well as a block to offer recreational facilities for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said the site was brought by the body through public auction, and that the lease did not have any restrictions on its land use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jockey Club is not required to apply for modifying its lease or pay a land premium to construct residential buildings on the site," the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the Jockey Club's decision, as a private land owner, whether and when to develop the site for residential purposes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site was occupied by two stable blocks in the 1930s, before it was rezoned for residential purposes in 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had periodically applied to renew the site's use as a recreational facility since then. The sports complex houses facilities such as tennis and squash courts, a golf simulation room, and fitness studios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmaker Andrew Lam noted the organisation owed the general public an explanation on the project, which he said had attracted a lot of attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are guessing [whether] the Jockey Club would be renting [out] the flats or even selling the flats to the general public...it attracts a lot of queries and concerns," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club was recently asked by the Town Planning Board to "actively implement" the zoned use of the site as originally designated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In securing the extension of the temporary planning permit this year, the organisation "had committed to redevelop the site into a residential cum sports complex, subject to further studies to be undertaken".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said he will unveil measures to address substandard living conditions in subdivided flats at the appropriate time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his Facebook page, Lee said he has received a report from a task force looking into subdivided flats, after officials wrapped up their research and gathered views from different stakeholders over the past 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report from the task force includes suggestions for minimum living standards and ways to replace this type of housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an official statement, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the task force, said the government is expected to provide 308,000 public housing units in the upcoming decade and these homes could offer a solution to long-existing subdivided housing issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that his task force will submit a follow-up report within one month, as instructed by the CE.

 China said it firmly opposes any country allowing the Dalai Lama to make visits under any pretext.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, senior US officials held talks with the Dalai Lama in New York where he was visiting to receive medical treatment. He met with US State Department official Uzra Zeya and White House National Security Council official Kelly Razzouk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has made solemn protests with the US," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing on Thursday.

  "We don't allow the Dalai Lama to engage in political separatist activities in the US."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Walz formally accepted his nomination to be the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate in a keynote address on Wednesday at the party's convention in Chicago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It's the honour of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason -- we love this country," Walz said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Minnesota governor, who was little known in America 15 days ago, acknowledged he had never given such a big speech but said that as a former high school football coach, "I have given a lot of pep talks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd responded with chants of "Coach, Coach, Coach!" Walz brought his plain-speaking style and small-town values to the national stage, joined by a litany of political luminaries and star entertainers on the third night of the Democratic National Convention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said America should be a place where children don't go hungry, healthcare and housing are human rights, "and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom," referring to Republican assaults on abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He spoke of preserving the freedoms that Democrats say are under attack from Trump, who is making his third major-party run for the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said a second Trump White House would serve nobody except the wealthy and most extreme.

    Chinese &amp; Western medicine collab for better care

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in family medicine on Thursday called on people to consult both a family doctor and a Chinese medicine practitioner once a year for regular check ups, adding that preventive care could lessen the burden on medical staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Liberal Party conducted a telephone questionnaire with more than 2,000 people over the past two months, in the hope of strengthening collaboration between Chinese and Western medical practitioners to better serve the public, and 70 percent said they would accept this medical partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Billy Chiu, a member of the party, said this "one plus one is greater than two" method of seeing two different practitioners could increase the chance of catching medical conditions early on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the aim is to do preventive care, so definitely with preventive care doing better, then obviously the percentage [of those] going to hospital will be much lower, so that will lead to less manpower demand inside the hospital," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the Hong Kong government's direction [on developing] the primary care commission and also 18 district health centres, I think we are looking forward to the outcome and also for the efficiency of increasing all these primary care preventive service models so with that, fewer people will go to inpatient [facilities] so the staff, the manpower planning, all this can be reviewed much efficiently."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chiu said that promoting collaboration could also allow for better communication and teamwork between the two medical fields when treating the same patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, I think many people, even including healthcare people, when we are not familiar about, for example, the drug interaction of Western medicine and herbs, so we simply tell people not to mix together or separate by four hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually with more evidence we know that some Chinese medicine and also Western medicine when taken together, we can see the more beneficial effect. Number two, [Chinese medicine] actually alleviates the side effects of some of the Western medicine."

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR passengers can ride on a replica of the rail operator's first-generation trains from Thursday, as part of the company's 45th anniversary celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The train will run on various lines until the end of the year and will be showcased at Choi Hung Station on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has the red and white front of the first-generation trains, as well as the MTR logo from back in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inside there are the ball-shaped straphangers of old, and an orange-yellow ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lighting has also been adjusted to a yellowish colour to give passengers a sense that they are travelling back in time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aaron was among hundreds of train enthusiasts who boarded the inaugural train at Choi Hung on Thursday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first time we saw the train we [thought] that it is quite [similar] to what we saw [in] the historical photos," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan told RTHK that the ball-shaped shapehangers felt better on the hand compared to the red-coloured handles used on other trains.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday hailed a cooperation project between Hong Kong and Thailand aimed at promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and green transport in the Southeast Asian country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony to kick off a partnership between the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) and Thai energy company Spark, Chan said that while the SAR is not known for mass EV production, its tech community is able to create innovative solutions for the vehicles and other new energy applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is proud to assist Thailand in its green transformation, using cutting-edge technologies developed by our tech firms, and contributing our know-how, innovation, expertise and experience,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This high-profile, international project is a brilliant showcase of our green technological capabilities. It reinforces Hong Kong's aspirations and prospects to become an international green tech and green finance centre.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the partnership is only the beginning of more collaborations with Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in the green, smart mobility field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC’s CEO Clara Chan noted that the investment is the corporation’s first overseas initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government-owned investment vehicle aspires to help Spark become one of the top three EV charging brands in Thailand by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To recap, as patient capital, the HKIC has been carrying out due mandate, namely to seek reasonable financial return over the medium to long term, and more importantly, to enhance the long term competitiveness and economic vitality of Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clara Chan said the HKIC's investments have been focused on a diversified range of fields, including core technology, biotechnology, new energy and green technology, spanning companies at various stages of development and from around the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets to local demonstrations by mainland Olympians who did well at the Paris Games were all snapped up in a little more than half an hour on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were some 5,000 tickets available for the public to go to two demonstrations on August 31, and a gala show the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The events are part of a three-day visit by the delegation to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people joined an online queue for the HK$20 tickets when they went on sale at 10am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two demonstrations, at Victoria Park Swimming Pool and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, will feature divers, swimmers, gymnasts, as well as table tennis and badminton players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said those who bought the tickets need to collect them at URBTIX outlets or from self-service ticketing kiosks on or before August 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After departing Hong Kong, members of the national team will spend three days in Macau.

    De Silva stars in Sri Lanka revival against England

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England trailed Sri Lanka by 214 runs on day one of the first test after bad light stopped play on Wednesday at Old Trafford where the tourists' decision to bat first backfired when they were all out for 236.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and opted to bat under cloudy skies but his side were three down for six runs after seven overs before he led their recovery efforts with a confident knock of 74 in the middle order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were 22 for no loss in four overs with Ben Duckett and Dan Lawrence at the crease. Sri Lanka, who were unable to get their fast bowlers to use the new ball in fading light, opted to walk off with a few minutes left until stumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a good day. When you bowl on day one on a test surface like that, to be batting at the end of the day I think you're really happy," said England's Chris Woakes, who took 3-32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a hard pitch offering assistance for England's seam attack in the first innings, Sri Lanka's openers were stifled early on as the bowlers dominated the opening session to reduce the visitors to 80-5 at lunch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, captained by Ollie Pope with Ben Stokes ruled out with a hamstring injury, were left frustrated when De Silva stitched together a valuable 63-run partnership with test debutant Milan Rathnayake, who came in at number nine. (Reuters)

    Maresca: Chelsea 'not a mess' after more transfers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maresca at Chelsea's season opener against Man City at Stamford Bridge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767146_1_20240822082401.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca insisted Wednesday he was not presiding over a "mess" of a squad after the London club were involved in yet more transfer activity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  João Felix signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge, with his return from Atletico Madrid to the club where he spent an underwhelming spell on loan in the 2022-23 season helping facilitate Conor Gallagher's move in the opposite direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca now has one of the largest squads in the Premier League at his disposal, although he has made it clear Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are not part of his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking ahead of Chelsea's Conference League play-off against Servette, Maresca said criticism of the club's transfer policy had been unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not working with 42 players, I am working with 21 players in first-team training," the Italian said. "It's not a mess like it looks from outside. The other players can even have 20 years contract, it is not my point. I don't care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the position of Sterling and Chilwell, he added: "In this moment, they are training apart from the squad. As I said, the situation with both of them is quite clear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a big squad, for me it's impossible to give everyone minutes so if they're looking for minutes, probably it is better to leave. And in case they don't leave, they have a contract here, they are Chelsea players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he was understandably more upbeat about João Felix, with Maresca – whose side started the new Premier League season with a 2-0 defeat by champions Manchester City last weekend, saying: "He is a good player, a talent. The club already knows him from two years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He can play different positions with us, inside, as a nine, outside," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No transfer fee was revealed for the former Benfica star, who made two appearances for Portugal at Euro 2024. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Wednesday following solid earnings from big-box retailer Target and Federal Reserve meeting minutes that hinted at an upcoming interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Target – Walmart's smaller, North American-focused rival – soared more than 11 percent after reporting higher comparable store sales in its second quarter after a string of declines.

  Meanwhile, futures markets continued to bet on a September interest rate cut following Fed meeting minutes in which a "vast majority" of policy makers expressed support for an interest rate cut if economic data plays out as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones ended up 0.1 percent at 40,890.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,620, while Nasdaq rose 0.6 percent to 17,918.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed minutes were "dovish and though they're dated, they suggest the debate is not whether the central bank cuts interest rate at its upcoming September meeting but rather how aggressive the initial phase of this normalization cycle should be," said a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interest rate cuts are expected in light of a weaker US jobs market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Department figures released on Wednesday showed US employers added around 68,000 fewer jobs monthly in the 12-month period through March 2024 compared with earlier estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Ford climbed 1.5 percent despite announcing US$1.9 billion in costs connected to shifts in its electric vehicle strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automaker scuttled plans for one new EV model and pushed back the timeframe on a second vehicle in light of a slower-than-expected transition to EVs in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com, the Chinese online retail company, fell 4.2 percent after disclosing that Walmart divested its shares in the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among retailers reporting Wednesday, TJ Maxx parent TJX jumped 6.1 percent while Macy's slumped 13 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's economic and trade links with China are "yielding results" as he welcomed Premier Li Qiang to the Kremlin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two sides boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy economic sanctions from the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our trade relations are developing successfully... The attention that the two governments on both sides are paying to trade and economic ties is yielding results," Putin said in a meeting with Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our states have worked out large-scale joint plans, projects in economic and humanitarian spheres, we expect for many years ahead," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li told Putin that "Chinese-Russian relations are at an unprecedentedly high level," according to the Kremlin's translation of his remarks, saying Putin and President Xi Jinping had created a "strong impulse for further deepening of bilateral relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate meeting with Li, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin hailed the countries' links as a powerful stabilising factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our partnership and strategic cooperation is especially important in a situation where new contours of the global order are being formed," Mishustin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And in these conditions, the Russia-China link is a powerful stabilising factor, promoting economic growth in both countries and increasing quality of life for our citizens," the Russian premier said. (AFP)

    Ship catches fire after attack off Yemen: UK agency

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three projectiles hit a merchant vessel off Yemen's rebel-held port city of Hodeida on Wednesday, causing a fire onboard and leaving the ship without engine power, a British maritime security agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Athens identified the vessel as the Greek-flagged Sounion oil tanker, and Greece's Maritime Affairs Minister Christos Stylianides condemned "a serious threat" to international shipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tanker was "struck by two unidentified projectiles before being hit by a third," said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its crew earlier exchanged fire with two small vessels, one with three to five people onboard while the second carried around 10, said the agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a fire onboard and the vessel has lost engine power," UKMTO said, adding that "the vessel is drifting and not under command."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the UKMTO and the Greek port authority said there were no reports of casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson for the port authority said the Sounion, an oil products tanker owned by Greek shipping company Delta Tankers, carried a crew of 25 people, mostly Filipinos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had departed from Iraq and was destined for a port near Athens where many refineries are based, the Greek port authority said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the ship could have been hit either by missiles or drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attack came as the Iran-backed Houthi rebels keep up a nine-month-old campaign against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that they say is in support of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stylianides in a statement "condemned the attack, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and a serious threat to the security of international shipping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such acts put the lives of seafarers at risk and disrupt the free movement of goods along vital maritime routes," the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate incident south of the Yemeni port city of Aden on Wednesday, another ship reported three explosions in the water in close proximity, UKMTO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew are reported safe and vessel is proceeding to the next port of call, the agency added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis' campaign of rocket and drone attacks has severely disrupted maritime traffic through the Red Sea, which normally accounts for up to 12 percent of world trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea now have security teams on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and Britain have responded to the attacks by striking Houthi targets in Yemen since January, but it has done little to deter the rebels. (AFP)

    Israel kills Fatah leader accused of 'terror attacks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel killed a senior member of the Palestinian Fatah movement in Lebanon on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating attacks in the West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response, the slain militant's Fatah party accused Israel of seeking to "ignite a regional war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khalil Maqdah was killed in a strike on his car in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, according to Fatah and a Lebanese security source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said an air force "aircraft struck the terrorist Khalil Hussein Khalil Al-Maqdah in the area of Sidon in southern Lebanon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said Maqdah was the brother of Mounir Maqdah, who heads the Lebanese branch of Fatah's armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and accused them both of "directing terror attacks and smuggling weapons" to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged that the pair "collaborate on behalf of" Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack marks the first such reported attack on a senior member of Fatah, the movement led by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, in more than 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement following the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fatah said Maqdah had been killed "in a cowardly assassination carried out by ... Zionist (Israeli) warplanes on Sidon," describing him as "one of the leaders" of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Lebanon, the movement's armed wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said Maqdah had "a central role" in "supporting the Palestinian people and its resistance" during the Gaza war and an "important role in supporting resistance cells" for years in the West Bank. (AFP)

    Indian PM Modi begins landmark Poland, Ukraine visit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi launched on Wednesday his historic trip to Poland and Ukraine, where the premier has pledged to campaign for a peaceful resolution of Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to make a Ukraine trip and first in 45 years to travel to Poland, Kyiv's staunch ally that is a key transit for foreign leaders heading to its war-torn neighbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda on Thursday, as well as with Indian nationals living in the Central European country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This visit will add momentum to the India-Poland friendship and benefit the people of our nations," Modi said on X upon landing in Warsaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Modi commemorated an Indian maharaja who sheltered Polish children during World War II, before laying flowers at a war memorial and delivering a speech to the Indian community in Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland "needs a lasting partnership with India," deputy Polish Prime Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters before Modi's visit, adding that economic ties would also be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has trodden a delicate balance between maintaining India's historically warm ties with Russia while courting closer security partnerships with Western nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His government has avoided explicit condemnations of Russia's 2022 operation in Ukraine, instead urging both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region," Modi said in a statement published on Wednesday before his departure for Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Kyiv, Modi will hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and "share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "India has consistently advocated for diplomacy and dialogue to reach a negotiated settlement," Indian foreign ministry official Tanmaya Lal said before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky announced on Monday that "a number of documents are also expected to be signed" during the meeting with Modi, whose previous diplomatic efforts drew condemnation from Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, hours after Russia pummelled multiple cities across Ukraine, Modi visited Moscow and was pictured hugging Putin at his residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also visited Russia in 2019 and hosted Putin in New Delhi two years later, weeks before Moscow began its offensive against Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India has largely shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia and abstained on UN resolutions targeting the Kremlin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Russia's fight with Ukraine has also had a human cost for India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi has pushed Moscow to return several of its citizens who signed up for "support jobs" with the Russian military but were later sent to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least five Indian soldiers have been killed in the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani man appeared in court on Wednesday to face charges of cyber terrorism after allegedly spreading disinformation on his clickbait website thought to have fuelled anti-immigration riots in Britain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Farhan Asif was accused of publishing an article on his Channel3Now website falsely claiming that a Muslim asylum seeker was suspected in a deadly knife attack on children in the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK authorities have blamed online misinformation for sparking days of riots which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers as well as police officers and other properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a 31-year-old software engineer with no journalism credentials, apart from running the Channel3Now website, which served as a source of income for him," a senior official at Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Initial investigations indicate that his sole intent was to make money through clickbait content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asif appeared at a Lahore district court on Wednesday charged with cyber terrorism and was remanded to custody for one day, the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article with the false information was published on Channel3Now just hours after the attack and was widely cited in viral social media posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen English towns and cities saw unrest and riots after the July 29 knife attack that killed three girls during a dance class in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder. (AFP)

    Germany goalkeeper Neuer retires from internationals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, a 2014 World Cup winner, announced his retirement from international football on Wednesday at the age of 38.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayern Munich veteran Neuer played 124 matches for Germany, captaining his country 61 times. His final appearance came in the quarter-final loss to eventual champions Spain at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer wrote on social media that although he was tempted to play until the 2026 World Cup, he was "convinced that now is the right time to take this step."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He shone at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and was named as the tournament's best goalkeeper as Germany won the trophy for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer revealed he had made the announcement after discussions with his family, as well as a comprehensive conversation with Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he planned to "concentrate fully" on playing for Bayern, with whom he has won two Champions Leagues and 11 Bundesliga titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season's Champions League final will take place at Munich's Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer broke his leg in a skiing accident in December 2022 and only returned to the Germany squad just ahead of Euro 2024 on home soil, reclaiming his role as first choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great time which shaped me and of which I am very proud," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winning the World Cup title in 2014 and the special atmosphere during the European Championship at home this year are highlights for which I am extremely grateful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was an honour for me to be captain of our national team until 2023. I loved wearing the Germany jersey."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer follows fellow 2014 World Cup winners Thomas Mueller and Toni Kroos, who both played at Euro 2024, into international retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, current Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan, who missed the 2014 World Cup campaign through injury, also announced he had played his last game at international level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A product of the Schalke academy in his home town of Gelsenkirchen, Neuer made his international debut in 2009 and has more caps than any other Germany goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany won 81 of the 124 matches Neuer played in, and he kept 51 clean sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The retirement clears the way for long-time back-up Marc Andre ter Stegen of Barcelona, who is expected to take over from the Bayern captain as Germany's number one. (AFP)

 Divers searching for six missing people following the sinking of a superyacht off Sicily in a storm have found two bodies, sources told media.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery brings the confirmed death toll to three. It was not immediately clear who had been found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The missing include British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and the chairman of Morgan Stanley International Jonathan Bloomer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen people survived, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven people, including the chairman and an executive director of a listed company, have been arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in connection with a fraud case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The investigation revealed that the chairman of the listed company and other individuals had allegedly falsified business documents and accounting records of the company's subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau, while the company's trade receivables totalling over MOP$113 million (about HK$110 million) were reduced,” the ICAC said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, the individuals concerned had also allegedly used false documents and accounting records to conceal the misappropriation of the company's funds over HK$9 million.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said it had teamed up with the Securities and Futures Commission to search six premises earlier this week and arrested the seven individuals involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees had allegedly committed the offence of agent using documents with intent to deceive his principal under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau police also searched the company's offices in Macau and interviewed individuals as part of their investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC added the investigation was ongoing and it would not make further comments on the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A delegation from Polytechnic University has won nine awards at the Silicon Valley International Inventions Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A cardiac monitoring device that's a tiny, light, wireless and wearable patch garnered two awards, including the semi-grand prize and a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Zheng Zijian, who led the research team behind the patch, said the device is as accurate as the machines used in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our permeable electronic skin, [electrocardiogram] electronic skin is the first of its kind that allows ICU-grade accuracy for long-term wearable… The permeability is superb, so that you can allow for long-term and accurate monitoring,” Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So for the next phase, we're working with the industries, venture capitalists, and trying to commercialise our technologies.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A nighttime brace designed to help teenagers with scoliosis earned a special prize issued by the Korea Invention Promotion Association, as well as a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Joanne Yip, who led the research team involved, said the brace could be commercialised next year and could sell for about HK$3,000 to HK$4,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our product, this nighttime brace, is the first one in the world using textile and soft robotics to provide early intervention for the patients with scoliosis. I can say this product is actually designed based on the patient's will, that we want to give them a more comfortable, but yet effective treatment,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are recruiting patients in Hong Kong for the clinical trial… We want to commercialise next year and because I think the cost is not too high, so it's affordable for patients and their families.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  University vice-president Professor Christopher Chao said this was the second time PolyU had joined the technology exhibition in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the main purpose was to help the research teams and startups understand the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They need to understand more about the market and also the investment ecosystem more, otherwise all these startup companies may not be able to be successful. In fact, this is sometimes even more important than the technology itself,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday announced that its first-half net profit for 2024 dropped three percent year-on-year to HK$6.13 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's bourse operator said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$4.36 per share, three percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, HKEX said net income for the second quarter, covering April to June, rose nine percent to HK$3.16 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were supported by the growth in trading and clearing fees from higher volumes across the cash, derivatives and commodities markets, according to HKEX's earnings statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKEX's Chief Executive Bonnie Chan said sentiment appears to be on the mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, while macro-environment uncertainties persist, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year," she added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Smart vending machines along harbourfront in service

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six smart vending machines along the Wan Chai harbourfront are now in operation, selling grab-and-go snacks and beverages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following a soft launch on Wednesday, people can order ice cream, popcorn, candyfloss and drinks from the self-service, unattended machines between 7am and 11pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are hoping to provide such services round-the-clock in future, but did not offer a timetable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the soft launch period, we will monitor the visitor flow and see if there is anything that we can do better elsewhere along the harbour," said the Development Bureau's senior engineer, Phoebe Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brendan, 6, was among the first to try the machines and told RTHK: "I just got ice cream and popcorn... I think they need like 100 kinds of flavours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist surnamed Bleazard said the prices for food and beverages, which are between HK$18 and HK$35, were reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The vending machine is good because you don't have to talk to anyone. You just choose what you want and you pay and you go,” he said. "Otherwise, you have to wait for the person, and hope they're open."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kiosks are part of an initiative announced in this year's budget to introduce food and beverages, retail and entertainment services on a pilot basis at “suitable harbourfront locations”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is hoping to introduce similar facilities along the promenade in East Kowloon by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Sports Institute is reviewing a funding scheme for athletes, with an outcome expected early next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as debate continues as to whether the city's athletes earn enough to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has been working to provide a more supportive environment to our athletes, so they can better train, compete and enjoy a good career path after retirement," Lee said at a reception for SAR Olympians at government headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Authorities have been in close contact with the sports institute and sports associations to strengthen the subsidy schemes and training regimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on Facebook afterwards, Lee said Hong Kong is proud of every Olympian, "whether they won a medal or not".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foil fencer Ryan Choi reignited the debate on athlete funding on Tuesday when he posted details of an unnamed teammate's income and expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fencer received a monthly allowance of HK$7,130 while having to shoulder costs for competing overseas, including air fares, accommodation and registration fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only want to shed light on the situation faced by some of my teammates, and hope they'll receive better treatment," he said in another online post on Wednesday, before removing both posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the reception, the president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, Timothy Fok, said more events are in the pipeline to make sure the athletes remain in the limelight after the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday started an anti-subsidy investigation into certain dairy products imported from the European Union (EU), according to the Ministry of Commerce.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The probe will cover imported dairy products including fresh cheese and curd, blue cheese, and some milk and cream, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will look at a number of subsidies under the EU's common agricultural policy and should be concluded within a year, but could be extended for six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
