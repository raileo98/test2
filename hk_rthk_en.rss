    Hongkong Post urged to boost e-commerce revenues

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hongkong Post says many unforeseen developments have impacted its ability to achieve the budgeted revenues. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750323_1_L_20240424130708.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday urged Hongkong Post to explore measures to boost its revenue in e-commerce services, after the postal department suffered losses from operations in seven of the past 10 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A report by the auditor noted that Hongkong Post also failed to meet the target rates of return on fixed assets for nine years in the past decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022-23, the postal department recorded a loss from operations of HK$305 million and a rate of return on fixed assets of negative 13 percent – far from the 1.5 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audit officials said local e-commerce services, which were intended to offset loss-making traditional mail services, did not perform well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that the profitability was negative each year throughout the previous five-year period with the deficit being around three-fold of the revenue each year, while Hongkong Post could not attain the budgeted revenue from local e-commerce services for each of the three years in the period from 2020-21 to 2022-23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Hongkong Post] needs to continue efforts in increasing the revenue and the mail volume of local e-commerce services, and explore effective measures to improve the profitability of local e-commerce services," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor cites Hongkong Post as saying it sets an aggressive target for budgeted revenues to motivate staff to maximise revenue generation. However, in the ever-changing business environment, there are many unforeseen developments, especially during the Covid-19 epidemic, which significantly impacted on [Hongkong Post's] ability to achieve the budgeted revenues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor also conducted a check on Hongkong Post's website and found that cross-border postal services for regions in mainland China were incorrectly listed as "international services".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The postal department has since revised such descriptions to "other destinations", according to the commission's report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate examination by the commission showed that service agreements between Hongkong Post and stamp designers lacked specific clauses concerning safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Postmaster General said Hongkong Post attaches great importance to national security and will incorporate such clauses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department said Peak Tram services remain suspended after several trees collapsed near the tracks amid heavy wind on Sunday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus route 15C, which connects the tram terminal to the Central ferry piers, is also suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department urged people to use other forms of public transport, adding that work is continuing to clear the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said they would notify the public when services resume.

    At least five die trying to cross English Channel

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least five people have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, according to French authorities, hours after Britain approved its migrant deportation bill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The regional Voix du Nord newspaper said the bodies were discovered at the Wimereaux beach in northern France on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local officials said about 110 migrants were crowded onto a small boat when panic broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither local authorities nor the coast guard could say how many people had been rescued or could be missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard was still carrying out search-and-rescue operations at sea, a spokesperson said, after what the official called a "busy" morning, with several crossing attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports of the deaths came only hours after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s latest effort to send some migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda finally won approval from Parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UK government plans to deport some of those who enter the country illegally as a deterrent to migrants who risk their lives in hopes they will be able to claim asylum once they reach Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Human rights groups have described the legislation as inhumane and cruel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the United Nations refugee agency and the Council of Europe called on Britain to rethink its plans for fears they could damage international cooperation on tackling the global migrant crisis. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The New York Knicks scored eight points in the final 27.4 seconds to stun the Philadelphia 76ers 104-101 on Monday and take a 2-0 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson's three-pointer pulled the Knicks within two points and after Josh Hart came up with a steal, Donte DiVincenzo capped a chaotic possession with a three-pointer – after missing his first attempt – to put New York up 102-101.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OG Anunoby sealed it at an ecstatic Madison Square Garden with a pair of free throws as the Knicks joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in taking a 2-0 lead in their first-round series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs led wire-to-wire in a 96-86 victory over the Orlando Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crushing defeat for the 76ers, who didn't trail until late in the third quarter, when a Brunson layup gave the Knicks a 68-67 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Philadelphia's NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid was clearly hindered late by pain in his surgically repaired left knee, but the Sixers appeared to have regained control when Tyrese Maxey, fed by Embiid, made a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that put the Sixers up 100-96.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyle Lowry added a free throw to give the Sixers a five-point lead with less than a minute to play, but the Knicks responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 24 points despite connecting on just eight of 29 shots from the field. He added eight rebounds and six assists and Hart added 21 points and 15 rebounds for New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maxey, who skipped the Sixers' morning shoot-around because of illness, finished with 35 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. Embiid added 34 points and 10 rebounds but missed a three-pointer at the final buzzer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Cleveland, Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points and Jarrett Allen added 16 points and 20 rebounds for the Cavaliers in another dominant win over the Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, eager to expunge the memory of their first-round loss to the Knicks last season, have posted two straight wire-to-wire victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolo Banchero led Orlando's scoring with 21 points and Franz Wagner added 18. The youthful Magic will be hoping to turn things around when the series shifts to Orlando. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Greek police on Monday made 60 arrests over hooligan violence that killed a riot officer during a volleyball game in December, the country's police chief said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Our commitment to combating sports violence is absolute," Dimitris Mallios said in a statement on the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yiorgos Lyggeridis, 31, was fatally injured by a marine flare fired outside a sports hall during a December 2023 Olympiacos-Panathinaikos volleyball match near Piraeus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The riot police officer died later in hospital and stadia across the country were closed for several weeks after the death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mallios said a four-month police investigation had found links between hooligans and organised crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 150 people are suspected of involvement, Mallios said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the authorities are ready for an influx of visitors during the mainland's Golden Week holiday next month, with preparations in place at immigration control points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said almost six million people are expected to enter or leave Hong Kong via the airport, rail and land crossings in the first week of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said special arrangements have been put in place for particularly busy periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The TLB (Transport and Logistics Bureau) and the Transport Department have already been in close contact with the transportation operators, so we'll be in full gear to ensure that there will be good and smooth service for visitors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll also be turning out officers to take care of the management of tourist groups because we want to spread them out, also to stagger the meal arrangement, so that they will be smoothly absorbed into the whole arrangement at different districts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Golden Week will be a good opportunity to show people that Hong Kong is a vibrant city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want the experiences of the visitors, that of course includes tourists and also maybe a result of the activities of local spenders, to have a good experience, both in taking meals, in shopping, in all kinds of services, businesses," he said.

    Boeing reports Q1 loss amid ongoing crisis

<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched after two sewer maintenance workers died in a manhole in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities say early indications are that the pair, and two other men who also fell ill while working in the manhole, inhaled hydrogen sulfide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department said the men were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were called at around midnight to reports that the workers had fallen ill while operating three to four metres underground at the Yuen Wo Playground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two men are said to be 26 and 34 years old. They were declared dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The two other workers were also treated at the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it had ordered a halt to work at the site and paused all similar work elsewhere until it could conduct safety checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It’s also launched an investigation and promised to work with the Labour Department and the police, who are also looking into the case. It's been classified as an industrial accident.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that officials plan to look into the feasibility of expanding a mental health support hotline to other platforms, such as instant messaging apps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 18111 hotline which launched last December has been receiving around 350 calls per day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said those seeking help wanted to talk about issues such as mental distress, family relationships, physical health problems and work pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the hotline operators have referred around 200 people to different organisations for support, and two urgent cases to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said officials have been regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the service and it could be expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the outcome of the review of the operation, we will consider the feasibility of extending the service to other platforms (such as instant messaging software) in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Mental Health in due course," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials plan to ask an independent organisation to conduct a full service evaluation study in the third quarter of the year, to collect views from NGOs and other stakeholders through questionnaires and focus groups.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation rate slightly rose in March, with the Composite Consumer Price Index up two percent on a year earlier.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compared to the 1.9 percent inflation rate in the previous two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department showed that underlying inflation, stripping out short-term relief measures, was also up marginally in March, at one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcohol and tobacco prices surged nearly 18 percent year-on-year, while meals out and takeaways were up 3.3 percent and housing costs rose 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electricity, gas and water prices dropped 8.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the underlying price inflation was “modest” in March, noting that prices of basic foods edged down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay contained in the near term. Domestic costs may face some upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad downward trend, though heightened geopolitical tensions will bring uncertainties,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first quarter of 2024, overall consumer prices rose 1.9 percent year-on-year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK readied on Tuesday to start detaining migrants within days for deportation to Rwanda after the controversial plan got parliament's approval, sparking outrage from the UN and rights groups.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new legislation – a flagship policy of the Conservative government that aims to curb irregular cross-Channel migration from northern France – cleared its final hurdle after a marathon late-night parliamentary tussle on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just hours later French police said at least five migrants, including a child, died overnight during an attempt to cross the busy shipping lane in a small boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the UK scheme, undocumented asylum seekers arriving in Britain would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be examined and, if approved, would allow them to stay in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says deportations are expected to begin within 10-12 weeks, with migrants identified for the first flight due to be detained and held from as early as this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rwanda said it was "pleased" to see the bill passed and was looking forward to "welcoming those relocated to Rwanda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the heads of the UN agencies for refugees and human rights warned it threatened the rule of law and set "a perilous precedent globally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged the UK to instead "take practical measures to address irregular flows of refugees and migrants, based on international cooperation and respect for international human rights law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Council of Europe also called for the new law to be scrapped and said it raised "major issues about the human rights of asylum seekers and the rule of law more generally." (AFP)

    First Ukraine aid to arrive in hours: Biden
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden says the aid deal sends a message to Vladimir Putin. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750417_1_L_20240425004717.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday met the Secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal Committee, Meng Fanli, to exchange views on furthering cooperation between the two cities.

  <br/>
  The government said the two leaders also talked about promoting high-quality development in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Hong Kong and Shenzhen had set up various working groups to promote collaboration in key areas including the Northern Metropolis, and the innovation and technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, which is located in the Lok Ma Chau Loop, would start to operate soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said Hong Kong would continue to build on its advantages to lead the development of the Greater Bay Area, as well as work with Shenzhen to contribute to the country's development.

    HK doesn't need a 'fake news' law, says CE

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday dismissed the need for legislation against "fake news", stressing the media sector's ability to improve credibility through professionalism and self-discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee acknowledged improvements in the dissemination of accurate information and praised the efforts of journalists' groups to combat misinformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the media industry is committed to maintaining the integrity of news reporting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will monitor the situation but my take is that if this problem can be addressed by enhancing professionalism, then it should be our first choice. We need to work together. There is no need for legislation. I always think that we can handle this issue with self-discipline as well as professionalism," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE's remarks came after Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the SCMP in an interview that the government has ruled out introducing a fake news law, an idea proposed by the previous administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said legislation in this area would be challenging due to complex legal issues surrounding the definition of fake news.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is aiming to roll out a scheme in the third quarter of the year to encourage people to rejoin the workforce.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme announced in his policy address in 2023, elderly and middle-aged people who have not been in paid employment for three consecutive months or more will be entitled to an allowance after working for at least six straight months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event organised by the Federation of Trade Unions marking the upcoming Labour Day, Lee also said the government will fine-tune the review mechanism of the city's minimum wage, as part of measures to better protect the rights of employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hailed their contributions to the city’s economic and social development, noting that authorities are going all out to stimulate the economy while improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This year's Labour Day is the first Labour Day in the SAR after the enactment of Article 23 of the Basic Law... We can [now] spare no effort to fight for the city’s economic growth, pursue development, improve people's livelihoods, and have all wage earners pursue happiness in a safe and stable environment,” he said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Laura Cha says Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will continue to develop its global connectivity, as she steps down from her role as chairwoman. Photo: Online meeting" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750387_1_L_20240424185647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan won Serie A on Monday after beating AC Milan 2-1 and creating an unassailable lead at the top of the league with their sixth straight derby victory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Francesco Acerbi and Marcus Thuram gave Inter a 17-point advantage over closest challengers Milan and secured their 20th league crown with five matches of the season remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simone Inzaghi won the first league title of his managerial career on a cold, soaking wet evening at the San Siro where a clutch of Inter's "away" fans in the 75,000 crowd roared in delight at the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milan made a fight of it in the final moments after Fikayo Tomori pulled one back with 10 minutes remaining but Inter held out to kick off a title party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inter have become the second team to win 20 Italian league titles and will have a second star stitched onto their jersey, after Juventus who are way out in the lead with 36 league crowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The future looks bright as Inzaghi, captain Lautaro Martinez and Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella are all set to renew their contracts while smart work in the transfer market and increased revenue has helped mitigate significant financial harm wrought by the Covid-29 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piotr Zielinski and Medhi Taremi will arrive from Napoli and Porto as free agents in the close season while big stars like Marcus Thuram should stay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Off the pitch Inter's president Steven Zhang is trying to make sure that investment fund Oaktree don't take control of the club with non-repayment of an emergency loan – granted in 2021 – next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang is looking at taking out another loan with fellow US fund Pimco so that Inter can pay Oaktree loan and ensure that the club don't wind up owned by Oaktree as Milan did with Elliott in 2018. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Wednesday began a three-day debate on the financial secretary's budget blueprint, with many of them praising Paul Chan's efforts to boost the economy despite a deficit of more than HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Various lawmakers lauded Chan for responding to their demands, such as removing all property-cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said the financial secretary offered much support to the people and various business sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The budget actively promotes the comprehensive development of our economy. There are measures to support the SMEs in tapping foreign markets. There's also support for IT development. It will build a Hong Kong brand comprehensively," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB chair also said it's high time Hong Kong reviewed comprehensively its advantages and complemented other cities in the Greater Bay Area, so that the region can enjoy development synergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Business and Professionals Alliance chairman Lo Wai-kwok described Paul Chan as a "master chef" who came up with "popular and healthy dishes" despite the budget shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The secretary has been tightening the purse strings while rolling out a series of measures to stimulate the economy so as to make sure government initiatives would be popular. It's not an easy task," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, meanwhile, said officials should look into widening Hong Kong's tax base as soon as possible, noting the public coffers would be hit particularly hard during economic downturns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vote on the budget is scheduled to take place in two weeks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government's office for attracting skilled workers to the city will host a global talent summit and expo at the Exhibition and Convention Centre in Wan Chai between May 7 and 8, to encourage more people to move to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Director of Hong Kong Talent Engage, Anthony Lau, on Tuesday said nearly 100 firms, public bodies and government departments were expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20 people will share their outlooks on the global job market and talent movement trends, as well as opportunities and exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said admission is free, and locals can also take part. The event will be broadcast live online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his office would provide information on different talent entry schemes, as well as support services for non-locals on how they can move to Hong Kong, offering advice on issues such as housing and education for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau noted that in the past year, finance and IT were among the sectors that attracted the most non-local talent to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For talent coming to Hong Kong, most of them are very interested in tips on every-day life. They also want more opportunities to learn Cantonese and practice the language," Lau told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said with Cantonese classes being so popular, his office would hold dozens more of them this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they are looking into a video showing a man jumping from platform to platform at an MTR station.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage circulating online appears to have been taken by the man himself as he leapt over the train track at Fo Tan Station on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR Corporation called in the police on Monday night after reviewing its CCTV footage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said the two platforms involved are more than two metres apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the man carrying out the stunt appears to be between 20 and 30 years old, while CCTV suggests another man of around the same age also filmed what happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the case has been classified as a breach of MTR by-laws. No arrests have been made.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue operations were underway after unseasonably heavy rain caused rivers to overflow, triggering landslides in Yingde city in flood-ravaged Guangdong province, broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes as the latest figures showed that four people have died as a result of the heavy rain, and 10 others are still missing. Provincial authorities have relocated some 110,000 residents so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue and emergency workers were seen tending to stranded residents on rescue boats in residential areas as well as commercial streets, in video aired by CCTV. The broadcaster also reported emergency supplies including food, water and other amenities were being provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one village, farmers stood at a flooded intersection along with belongings they managed to save, including a washing machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everything's gone, all the seedlings are gone," said Huang Jingrong, 61.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all flooded, flooded beyond repair," he said, estimating his losses at about 100,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, massive flooding has occurred in Beijiang River in the Pearl River basin on Monday due to the continuous heavy rain, according to the Ministry of Water Resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained and widespread rainfall since Thursday, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the region's annual flooding season. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A total of 16 awards were given out at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750412_1_L_20240424231351.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

    HKEX sees profit drop 13pc in Q1

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Zaccharie Risacher plays for French side JLB Bourg. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750067_1_L_20240423074755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French teen Zaccharie Risacher submitted paperwork to the NBA to become eligible for the 2024 NBA Draft, where he is considered a potential number one selection, ESPN reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  If he is top pick, Risacher would follow in the footsteps of another French teen, Victor Wembanyama, who has had a stellar debut season at the San Antonio Spurs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 6-foot-10 [2.08m] small forward, who turned 19 two weeks ago, told ESPN he made the move to achieve a dream as he continues a strong season for JL Bourg of Pro A, the top French league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has always been my dream to get to the best league in the world," Risacher said. "I've been putting in the work for this since I was a kid. JL Bourg has given me an incredible opportunity to showcase what I can do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher is averaging 10.4 points and 3.4 rebounds while shooting 39% from 3-point range and he plays tough defensively, often opposing a rival's top scoring threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher, whose father Stephane was a star in European leagues and helped France take a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, sparked JL Bourg to the EuroCup Final that they lost earlier this month to Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's NBA Draft is June 26-27 in New York. The top selection order will be decided after the NBA Draft Lottery on May 12 in Chicago, with the 14 clubs who missed the playoffs having a chance to land the top pick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama was the top pick in last year's NBA Draft and posted impressive stats of 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals a game in his first season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the French playoffs upcoming, Risacher will have many more games and much more travel than rivals of the same age in his NBA Draft class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of things I can bring an NBA team," he said. "My number one strength is my shooting. Then my defensive ability after that. And lastly, my ability to do what's asked of me, using my versatility -- I can rebound, handle the ball if needed, finish above the rim, pass the ball." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Monday, shrugging off recent weakness at the start of a heavy week of earnings from technology and industrial companies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the tensions in the Middle East didn't escalate," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Friday, in part due to selling ahead of the weekend amid fears of a worsening in the Israel-Iran conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,239.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 5,010, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.1 percent to 15,451.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in positive territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's earnings calendar includes results from tech titans such as Amazon and Microsoft, as well as from industrial companies including Chevron and General Motors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla, which also reports this week, fell 3.4 percent following another round of price cuts – the latest sign of intensifying competition among electric vehicle manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verizon dropped 4.6 percent as analysts cited worries about a soft demand picture, with net broadband subscriber additions slowing compared with the prior quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike slid 0.4 percent after disclosing to state officials in Oregon that it plans to cut 740 jobs from its headquarters. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it strongly opposed and disapproved of a report by the United States on the human rights situation in Hong Kong last year, calling it "unfounded and biased".
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman of the SAR government said it condemned repeated US attempts to politicise human rights in the so-called annual human rights report by the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR government strongly demands that the US immediately stop acting against the international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs," the spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration is against the wanton slander on Hong Kong where the One Country, Two Systems principle is successfully implemented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that the SAR's laws on national security clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected.

    First trial under UN anti-terrorism law gets underway

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750185_1_L_20240423173240.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance got underway at the High Court on Tuesday, over an alleged attempt to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Lai Chun-pong and Justin Hui deny "conspiracy to commit bombing of prescribed objects", while Lau Pui-ying has pleaded not guilty to a conspiracy charge relating to providing or collecting property to commit terrorist acts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the court that the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019 – one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first bomb was designed to make police move to where the second was planted, the prosecution said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the second bomb was bigger, with a power radius of 400 metres, and it contained 150 iron nails which would have caused serious casualties and property damage had it been detonated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defendants also planned to shoot police officers, the court was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the nine-person jury that Cheung Ming-yu, Hui and Lai received military training in Taiwan in September 2019, and that the trio also went up a hill in Sai Kung to test their guns three weeks before the day of the planned attack, which police say they foiled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution's witnesses for the trial include a co-defendant who pleaded guilty, Wong Chun-keung, who is said to have been the leader of the group behind the alleged bomb plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong authorities have brought a prosecution using the anti-terrorism ordinance since it was enacted in July 2002.

    NBA Nets name Spaniard Fernandez as new head coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fernandez coached Canada to bronze at last year's FIBA World Cup. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750072_1_L_20240423080738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jordi Fernandez, who guided Canada to a bronze medal in last year's World Cup, was named as the new head coach of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 41-year-old Spaniard, who had served as associate head coach of the Sacramento Kings for the past two seasons, will replace interim coach Kevin Ollie, who took over after Jacque Vaughn was fired in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce Jordi Fernandez as Brooklyn's new head coach," Nets general manager Sean Marks said. "As we progressed through an extensive search over the past six weeks, it became increasingly clear that Jordi is the best coach to lead our team forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Jordi brings a diverse set of experiences and basketball knowledge gained over the course of a coaching career that has taken him around the world. Each step of the way, Jordi has consistently demonstrated the ability to implement strong processes and creative systems designed to optimize each team's specific roster."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez helped the Kings reach the playoffs for the first time since 2006 last year, although Sacramento was eliminated by Golden State in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kings were eliminated by New Orleans in the eighth-seed play-in game this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm truly grateful to lead the Nets," Fernandez said, calling it an "exciting and humbling opportunity" and added, "We will be fully committed to building something special for Nets fans and the borough to be proud of for years to come."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nets went 32-50 this season and missed the playoffs. Brooklyn has lost eight of 10 playoff series since moving from New Jersey in 2012, never advancing past the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Jordi to build a sustainable winning culture in Brooklyn," Nets team owner Joe Tsai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez took over the Canadian national team last June and guided the squad to a 6-2 World Cup run, including a victory over the United States for third place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will still coach the Canadians at this year's Paris Olympics even with the Nets hiring, Canada Basketball said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez spent six seasons as an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets, served as an assistant coach for Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics and for Spain at the 2017 EuroBasket. (AFP)

    Audit Commission urges rehabus to scale up services
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday called on a minibus operator catering for the disabled to beef up its services, saying it turned down requests for pre-booked trips even though vehicles were available.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In its report, the watchdog said the government-subsidised rehabus operator rejected 21,425 orders for door-to-door transportation in 2023, double the figure recorded in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were on average nine to 42 spare vehicles on a weekday from 2019 to last year, the body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission added that around one-fifth of the 121 fixed routes averaged six or even fewer passengers a month, while the waiting list for services had become longer, with someone on it for almost two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Routes running between hospitals, clinics and MTR stations operated by another company were also under-used, the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among 12 hospital routes, three were transporting zero passengers 80 percent of the time in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said the operators should review their routes and improve patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added the Transport Department should look at requests to purchase more rehabus vehicles carefully, noting the operators did not report on the utilisation of existing vehicles when asking the government for funding to buy new ones from 2021 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  124 vehicles costing HK$135 million in total were procured from 2018 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner for Transport, for her part, said she agreed with the audit recommendations.

    Officials advised to learn lessons from toilet saga

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials tasked with revitalising countryside areas are being urged to learn lessons over a HK$13 million "smart toilet" which turned out to be anything but.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Users of the toilet in the New Territories village of Lai Chi Wo were promised a hands-free experience, with the amenity boasting automatic sliding doors that opened and closed with just a wave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two years of construction, the toilet was completed in the summer of 2023 and was trumpeted as a showpiece facility that could boost the image of countryside washrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it all went down the pan not long after it opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On 9 December 2023, a user was locked up inside the new public toilet as the automatic sliding door could not be opened by waving hands over the control panel or pressing the emergency button," the Audit Commission noted in a report on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was later discovered that special panels installed on the roof of the toilet, which were meant to purify air as well as generate electricity, were not producing enough power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the automatic door system was subsequently disabled and the sliding doors converted to manual operation "to restore the public’s confidence over the usage of the toilet".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that as well as supposedly being "smart", the toilet was also originally estimated to have been almost HK$5 million cheaper than it was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission said the Countryside Conservation Office responsible for the project should draw on the experience it gained with the toilet when it embarks on other minor improvement works in the future.

    'Similar accident happened at Sha Tin manhole in 2006'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims says a similar fatal accident happened before in 2006." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750138_1_L_20240423125304.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A workers' rights group on Tuesday said it is angry about the manhole incident in which two workers died, noting that a similar accident happened at the same site before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said a pair of workers had died in 2006 after working in a manhole on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Construction Industry Employees General Union also said authorities failed to learn lessons from the previous accident, and called on them to review regulations and enforcement practices to get rid of any loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's chief executive Siu Sin-man said the Labour Department should ask construction companies to notify authorities before starting work in a manhole so inspections can take place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The system can effectively strengthen the contractors' vigilance because they need to provide many supporting [documents] to the Labour Department to show they have done the best preparations including safety precautions," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Labour Department knows more about the ongoing projects, there can be better monitoring."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body said the Drainage Services Department needs to ensure that contractors fully comply with safety standards by conducting risk assessments, installing ventilators and monitoring equipment in the manholes, as well as arranging safety harnesses for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it is trying to get in touch with the families of the workers to offer assistance.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the families of two workers who died in a manhole in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Initial investigations showed the pair inhaled hydrogen sulfide and fainted while working in the manhole. They were later certified dead at the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said relevant departments were looking into the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that the Drainage Services Department has started reviewing the safety of similar works, and related works have been suspended," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the Labour Department can conduct a detailed investigation as soon as possible to look into the cause of the accident. We will wait for the result of the investigation before we take follow up actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that various stakeholders had the responsibility to prevent industrial accidents from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the investigation would focus on the workers’ decision to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Workers should not be asked to enter manholes when they clean the drainage. They just have to spray water with high-pressure from above ground," she said during a Legco panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So why did the workers enter the manhole, leading to fatalities? That is one of the directions of the investigation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A code of practice for safety and health at work in confined spaces was first introduced in 2000, and the government earlier said it planned to revise the code of practice in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said it had suspended the contractors from tendering for public works related to roads and drainage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The contractors concerned have to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. The contractors are required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures," a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said the suspension would only be lifted if the contractors demonstrated an effective safety management system.

    China slams US military aid package to Taiwan

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has condemned the latest package of US military assistance to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Senate on Tuesday passed US$95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package included US$8 billion for the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid seriously violates US commitments to China and sends a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affair and does not tolerate any external interference," spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said US military support for the island only increased the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to emphasise that the United States and Taiwan strengthening military ties will not bring about security for Taiwan," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will only increase tensions and the risk of conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and will ultimately be an act of shooting oneself in the foot." (Agencies)

    Feyenoord boss Slot leading race for Liverpool job

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Arne Slot led Feyenoord to their first Eredivisie title in six years last season. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750243_1_L_20240424011914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord coach Arne Slot has emerged as the leading contender to succeed Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, according to British media reports on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slot, 45, led Feyenoord to their first league title in six years last season and won the Dutch Cup on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had been a front runner to take over at Tottenham a year ago before ruling himself out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky Sports, the BBC and The Times all reported that Slot is now leading the race for the unenviable task of following Klopp at Anfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Reds could face competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona, who are also looking for new coaches next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite when Klopp announced his decision in January to stand down at the end of the season after nearly nine years in the role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool vacancy but reportedly held talks with West Ham on Monday about replacing David Moyes next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand. (AFP)

    'Precautions also apply to sites near manholes'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A construction union group's safety adviser says people working near manholes can also be exposed to a high concentration of gas. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750303_1_L_20240424112457.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Safety measures for working in confined spaces also apply to sites connected to manholes, a construction group said on Wednesday, following the deaths this week of two sewer maintenance workers who were suspected to have been exposed to toxic gas in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the pair, who are thought to have inhaled hydrogen sulfide, were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee Kwong-sing, a safety adviser with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said people working near a manhole could also be exposed to a high concentration of gas when the cover is opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [hazardous] gas is concentrated enough, people near the manhole may have a chance of inhaling a high concentration of toxic gas... and possibly faint and fall into the manhole," Lee told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said current regulations stipulate that precautions are required for people working in a confined space and also in the vicinity of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, workers were using high-pressure water jets near the manhole," Lee said. "So one can't say because workers are not going into the manhole, there is no need for precautionary measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing said the government needs to tighten up guidelines for people working in confined spaces, including more stringent tests on hazardous gases and mandatory video monitoring of workers inside manholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Tuesday evening said a revised code on working in confined spaces would be ready in one to two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, agreed with suggestions that construction companies should notify authorities before work starts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those small-scale construction works, related to high-risk tasks such as [working in] confined spaces and manholes, you also need to report and notify the Labour Department," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, contractors are not required to submit project reports to labour officials in advance if such work will involve at most 10 workers and will be completed within six weeks.

    Nasa's Voyager 1 phones home after months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory fixed a single malfunctioning chip that was causing Voyager 1 to spout gibberish. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750051_1_L_20240423043314.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa's Voyager 1 probe – the most distant man-made object in the universe – is returning usable information to ground control following months of spouting gibberish, the US space agency announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The spaceship stopped sending readable data back to Earth on November 14, 2023, even though controllers could tell it was still receiving their commands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, teams working at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory discovered that a single malfunctioning chip was to blame, and devised a clever coding fix that worked within the tight memory constraints of its 46-year-old computer system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Voyager 1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems," the agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 was mankind's first spacecraft to enter the interstellar medium, in 2012, and is currently more than 15 billion miles from Earth. Messages sent from Earth take about 22.5 hours to reach the spacecraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its twin, Voyager 2, also left the solar system in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Voyager spacecraft carry "Golden Records" – 12-inch, gold-plated copper discs intended to convey the story of our world to extraterrestrials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include a map of our solar system, a piece of uranium that serves as a radioactive clock allowing recipients to date the spaceship's launch, and symbolic instructions that convey how to play the record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The contents of the record, selected for Nasa by a committee chaired by legendary astronomer Carl Sagan, include encoded images of life on Earth, as well as music and sounds that can be played using an included stylus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their power banks are expected to be depleted sometime after 2025. They will then continue to wander the Milky Way, potentially for eternity, in silence. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker told the NY court how he would suppress negative stories about Donald Trump. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750251_1_L_20240424035636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A colourful former tabloid publisher took the witness stand on Tuesday at Donald Trump's "hush money" trial and described how he suppressed negative stories about the real estate tycoon, a practice known as "catch and kill."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors allege that Trump engaged in "election fraud" by having his then personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to the adult film actress on the eve of the 2016 election in which he defeated Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, former publisher of the National Enquirer, was the first witness called to testify by prosecutors at Trump's high-stakes trial, which comes less than seven months ahead of his expected rematch against President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors are seeking with Pecker's testimony to demonstrate that the "catch and kill" scheme of squashing negative stories was one commonly used by Trump and Cohen, the once loyal "fixer" who has since turned against his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker took the stand after a nearly 90-minute hearing during which Judge Juan Merchan was asked by prosecutors to hold Trump in contempt of court for violating a partial gag order preventing him from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors or court staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan heard arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys but did not issue an immediate ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he has known Trump since 1989 and described him as a friend – "I would call him Donald."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said National Enquirer readers "loved" Trump, who starred in the hit reality television series "The Apprentice" before going into politics in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he agreed at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower with Trump, Cohen and Trump's personal assistant Hope Hicks to help his friend's nascent campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said what I would do is, I would run or publish positive stories about Mr Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he would also warn Cohen about potential negative stories about Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I notified Michael Cohen of a story that was a negative story, he would try to vet it himself, see if the story was true or not," Pecker said. "And he would go to the individual publication to make sure the story wasn't published and get it killed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors walked Pecker through two payments made to squash negative stories. One involved a Trump Tower doorman who was peddling a false claim that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other involved a former Playboy magazine model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with the married Trump. She was paid US$150,000 not to go public with the story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker is to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Pecker testified, prosecutors – at a hearing held without the jury present – accused Trump of brazenly violating the gag order imposed by the judge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's "willful" attacks on witnesses "clearly violate" the gag order, prosecutor Chris Conroy said, urging the judge to fine him US$1,000 per violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty," Conroy said, but the court should "remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Cohen are both expected to appear as prosecution witnesses at the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Truth Social, calling them, for example, "sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lashed out at the judge following the day's proceedings, calling the gag order "unconstitutional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not allowed to talk but people are allowed to talk about me," he said. "They can lie but I'm not allowed to say anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained that Biden is "out campaigning and I'm here in the courtroom."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very unfair situation." (AFP)

    Legco expansion to be completed by year's end

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legco President Andrew Leung on Tuesday said the expanded Legislative Council Complex in Admiralty was expected to come into operation at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Four storeys are being added to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, several government officials, and Leung attended the "topping out" ceremony at Legco and visited the newly built 12th floor, marking a milestone in progress on the expansion of the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he hopes Legco members can move into the building by the end of the year so that they can work under the same roof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Wendy Hong, who is one of dozens of members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as their temporary office, said it would be more convenient when they moved back to Legco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look forward to move back soon because now we have meetings in the Legco building, but our office is in another building," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes it's difficult for us to arrange [meeting] times. When you have 20, 15 minutes in between two meetings, it's difficult for you to go back to the office and come back [to Legco] again. But now we can go back to office and come back. It's easier to arrange time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction of the new floors began in 2022, with the project costing around HK$400 million more than the original estimate, from HK$1.17 billion to HK$1.56 billion.

    Initial response to plastic tableware ban positive: CE

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the initial response to a ban on plastic tableware has been positive, adding the government would monitor the supply and price of alternative products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking a day after the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect, Lee said it takes time for people's behaviour to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are aware that these alternatives cost about several cents or 20 cents or so. So they are affordable. I do believe that they will not be too costly in the operation of businesses," he told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is an international trend to move away from plastic. Alternative products have been developed over quite some time. We have just started the regulation of plastic tableware. We do hope that Hong Kong people will understand that it is our responsibility to protect the environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added the Environmental Protection Department had provided a list of around 700 suitable non-plastic alternatives for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the ban prohibits the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in China for a three-day visit as the two countries try to keep relations on an even keel amid differences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken landed in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon where he will meet students and business leaders. He'll later head to Beijing and hold talks with top Chinese officials there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides are expected to discuss issues such as Ukraine, regional peace and stability, and fentanyl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Blinken's second visit to China in less than a year, following up on recent phone talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency noted that bilateral ties have begun to stabilise since the two leaders met in San Francisco last November, with significant exchanges in various fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains committed to open dialogue and communication with the United States. However, Washington must recognise that dialogue must be based on equality and respect, and actions must align with words," Xinhua said. (Agencies)

    Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'
   </title>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Wednesday called on the government to improve labour protection, boost benefits for public servants and increase the city's minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nine labour and civil service unions issued a "Labour Day Declaration" ahead of May 1, with 10 policy suggestions, including an end to further labour imports and improving occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, Lee Kwok-keung, said the city’s minimum hourly wage should be increased by HK$15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While our proposed increase from HK$40 an hour to HK$55 seems substantial, we should bear in mind the fact that a basic lunch can easily cost HK$55. If the minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost of a meal, it's not really reasonable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, meanwhile, noted a recent 0.1 percentage point increase in Hong Kong's unemployment rate, meaning an extra 9,400 people – 111,700 in total – were out of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, urged the government to provide a job-matching service for businesses participating in labour importation schemes, with the aim of getting them to prioritise local people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federation of HKSAR Civil Servants, Lee Fong-chung, said there is a need for the government to come up with policies to address staff shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the annual retirement rate for senior government positions has hit 10 percent and there has been a "huge" number of resignations in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think it's very important for the government to refill the vacancies as soon as possible, through regular recruitment or transferring some contract [workers] onto permanent terms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the number of government workers in their 20s and 30s resigning has been particularly high and more family-friendly policies are needed to keep hold of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Like [increasing] maternity leave… And also, the government may amend some policy on the long-term investment for the civil servants, like they can use a portion of their pension fund for them to buy a house or to buy medical insurance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Government Employees Association, Cheung Hoi-wing, added that many civil servants have chosen to retire in mainland cities in recent years and the government should extend civil servant healthcare benefits to cover the whole Greater Bay Area.

    Albanese slams 'arrogant' Musk as X faces court blow

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian court has ordered X to hide some posts commenting on the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, deepening a war of words between the social media platform's owner Elon Musk and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia's federal court late on Monday granted the country's cyber regulator, the eSafety commissioner, a two-day injunction requiring the social media platform to hide some posts on a knife attack last week against an Assyrian church bishop, Mar Mari Emmanuel, during a service at his church.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Tuesday hit out at Musk, calling him an "arrogant billionaire" for pushing back against the Australian government's calls to take down the content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  X had blocked the content for its users in Australia but said it would not block the posts for users outside the country, arguing that the government had no authority to dictate content its users can see globally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos of the attack posted online showed the attacker, restrained by the congregation, shouting at the bishop for insulting Islam. Police have charged a 16-year-old with a terrorism offence over the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regulator had asked X to remove certain posts that publicly commented on the attack, which could include videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Geoffrey Kennett, in an after-hours hearing, ordered X to block access to the posts until Wednesday afternoon, court documents showed. The matter will be considered again on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said social media must have social responsibility but Musk was fighting to keep violent content on his platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll do what's necessary to take on this arrogant billionaire who thinks he's above the law, but also above common decency," Albanese told national broadcaster ABC on Tuesday. "What the eSafety Commissioner is doing, is doing her job to protect the interests of Australians."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk had earlier called the eSafety commissioner the "Australian censorship commissar", drawing rebuke from Albanese who described X's fight against removing violent content as "extraordinary".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful one," Musk said in a post on X hours before Albanese's comments on Tuesday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Malaysian navy helicopters collided in mid-air during a rehearsal on Tuesday for a naval parade, killing all 10 crew members aboard, the country's navy said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Naval officials said the incident occurred at the Lumut base in the western state of Perak on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All victims were confirmed dead at the scene and sent to the Lumut base military hospital for identification," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video circulating on local media showed several helicopters flying in formation, when one of the choppers' rotor clipped another before both aircraft crashed into the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The navy said it would carry out an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the aircraft - a maritime operations helicopter and a Fennec military chopper - were rehearsing for a parade celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Royal Malaysian Navy, due to be held on Saturday. (Reuters)

    China introduces fresh crew for Tiangong space station

<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Manned Space Agency on Wednesday introduced the crew for the Shenzhou-18 mission, the latest in a programme that aims to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trio of astronauts will be led by Ye Guangfu, a fighter pilot and veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye, along with Li Cong and Li Guangsu are scheduled to blast off at 8.59pm local time on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. They will relieve the Shenzhou-17 team who are currently on the Tiangong space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Jiuquan, Ye said the mission will be a special one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very special time and also carries special meaning. During the mission this time in China's space station, we will celebrate China's 75th anniversary of its founding and today is also China's ninth Space Day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye also stressed that China believes in international collaboration when it comes to space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us, we all actually pursue our dream to establish a space station, explore space, and also to make contributions. I believe we'll make great contributions to build a community of shared future for mankind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also sincerely invite our international peers to explore the vast universe together and to create a better future for mankind with joint efforts, and a China space station you can always look up to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tiangong is the crown jewel of Beijing's space programme – which has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon – and made China the third country to put humans in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new crew will replace the Shenzhou-17 team, who were sent to the station in October, and stay in orbit for six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhou-17 crew is scheduled to return to Earth on April 30. (Additional reporting by AFP and Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaden McDaniels scored 25 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves dominated the Phoenix Suns 105-93 to take a 2-0 series lead in the NBA playoffs on Tuesday, while Indiana roared back to beat Milwaukee 125-108 and square their best-of-seven duel at 1-1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McDaniels led a balanced Minnesota offensive effort that saw all five starters finish in double digits as the Western Conference third seeds moved to within two wins of a series victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was the Timberwolves defence who turned the game in the home side's favor, shutting down Phoenix in the second half to frustrate Suns stars Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A torrid night for Phoenix ended with Booker fouling out in the fourth quarter while the Suns also were handed an injury scare, with Grayson Allen hobbling off in the third quarter after rolling an ankle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Suns coach Frank Vogel will have his work cut out for him when the series heads to Arizona for game three on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves will go into that fixture brimming with confidence after restricting Phoenix's offense to 42 second-half points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota scored 31 points off 20 Phoenix turnovers while the Suns took just two points from the Wolves' 14 turnovers throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Milwaukee, Pascal Siakam poured in 37 points to guide the Pacers to an impressive series-leveling win over the Bucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siakam finished with 11 rebounds and six assists while Myles Turner added 22 and Andrew Nembhard 20 as the Pacers claimed a deserved win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milwaukee started brightly, with Damian Lillard once again taking on the lion's share of the scoring duties in the absence of the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lillard's 34 points were not enough to keep the Pacers at arm's length. Indiana took the lead just before half-time and finally pulled away in the fourth quarter, leading by 23 points at one stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game three in the series takes place in Indianapolis on Friday. (AFP)

    London's FTSE strikes record as global sentiment lifts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the US dollar.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's FTSE 100 stocks index hit record highs on Tuesday, catching up with major global peers that have struck all-time peaks this year as inflation cools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sentiment was upbeat across major world indices thanks to easing Middle East worries and hopes of interest-rate cuts, while traders are keenly awaiting the release this week of more major earnings and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's FTSE 100 reached 8,076 points shortly after the open, surpassing a record 8,047 struck in February last year, though it pared down gains in afternoon deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good news as this is, it does highlight the sluggishness of the UK's top equity index when compared to its US and European competitors which hit a string of successive records throughout the first quarter of 2024," said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he added, "let's not be too churlish as it could be we see the FTSE outperform its rivals in the years to come should investors seek out dividend paying value stocks rather than techy growthy ones."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the dollar, as markets anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the coming months thanks to slowing price rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A weaker pound benefits FTSE-listed British multinationals that make big earnings in foreign currencies. Sterling gained against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after falling earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets won a lift from news of an improvement to business activity in the eurozone this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street opened higher on a busy week on the corporate front, with investors keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings from Elon Musk's Tesla later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker, which enjoyed scorching growth for most of 2022 and 2023, has experienced setbacks that analysts say have raised the stakes for the first-quarter report. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations called on Tuesday for an international investigation into reports of mass graves at two Gaza hospitals destroyed in Israeli sieges, saying war crimes might have been committed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it was "horrified" by the destruction of Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, and its second largest, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday that health workers had uncovered nearly 340 bodies, updating an earlier figure, of Palestinians allegedly killed and buried by Israeli forces at the Nasser complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army dismissed claims that its troops had buried bodies during its operation at Nasser as "baseless and unfounded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office demanded "independent, effective and transparent investigations into the deaths."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals, which are protected under international law, have repeatedly come under Israeli bombardment over more than six months of war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted during its attack inside Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has denied the claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law," Turk said. "And the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat is a war crime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it did not have access to independent information as to what happened at the two hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said efforts were under way to corroborate reports and details given by Gazan authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victims had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste," she told reporters in Geneva, adding that older people, women and wounded were reportedly among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were allegedly "found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes." (AFP)

    Forest call for release of VAR audio as row grows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ashley Young's challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi in the 56th minute was one of the incidents mentioned in Nottingham Forest's compalint. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750047_1_L_20240423031529.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest have asked for the VAR audio to be released from their three denied penalty appeals in a 2-0 defeat at Everton that sparked the club to call into question the integrity of Premier League officiating.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Forest issued an extraordinary post on social media soon after the final whistle at Goodison Park on Sunday saying they had "warned" referees body the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) that VAR official Stuart Attwell is a fan of relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest are just one point and one place above Luton, who are in the drop zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nottingham Forest has today submitted a formal request to the PGMOL to release into the public domain the audio recordings between officials during yesterday's match against Everton at Goodison Park," Forest said in a statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club has requested this be shared for three key match incidents - Ashley Young's challenge on Giovanni Reyna (24th minute), Ashley Young's handball (44th minute) and Ashley Young's challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi (56th minute).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We firmly advocate for the broader football community and supporters to have access to the audio and transcript for full transparency, ensuring the integrity of our sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PGMOL have been pressured into releasing audio recordings of controversial incidents earlier in the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referees' chiefs were forced to admit an error after Liverpool had a goal at Tottenham wrongly ruled out for offside as the VAR officials thought the goal had been awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audio of other selected incidents has also been broadcast on the "Match Officials Mic'd Up" programme during the season, but the laws of the game prevent such audio being broadcast live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Football Association has asked Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo, defender Neco Williams and referee analyst Mark Clattenburg to explain comments they made post-match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest enlisted the services of former referee Clattenburg in February as a consultant analyst to fight in their corner after believing they had been on the wrong end of a series of contentious decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in his Daily Mail column, Clattenburg said: "One of these errors would have been bad enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Three was a joke, and that is why Nottingham Forest were left feeling victimised after another defeat in which zero big decisions went their way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Forest's public blast at the officials has been hit with a backlash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher accused the two-time European champions of sounding like a "fan in a pub."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Stuart Attwell and Anthony Taylor (the referee) have had an horrific day today, awful, and they should be rightly criticised for that and that could have real implications for Nottingham Forest," said Carragher, now a Sky Sports pundit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I get the frustration, but that, what I've just read there on social media, that's like a fan in a pub. That is embarrassing from Nottingham Forest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow pundit Gary Neville called on Clattenburg to resign from his role with the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If he sees those words go out, which question the integrity and essentially call a VAR official a cheat because he supports a certain club, then he's supporting what's being said and he would basically lose all credibility, I think, with referees in the game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win for Everton lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone with five games to play, despite being deducted eight points this season for breaches of financial rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest have been docked four points for the same reason. (AFP)

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750299_1_L_20240424111040.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kai Havertz celebrates scoring his first and Arsenal's third goal of the night. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750268_1_L_20240424074751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Havertz and Ben White scored twice as Arsenal thrashed Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday to surge ahead in the Premier League title race and up the pressure on Liverpool and Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The destiny of the title remains in City's hands as the defending champions have two games in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have also played one fewer game than Arsenal and are in action at Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men's goal difference advantage now looks unassailable should it become decisive in the title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts flew out of the blocks and were in front inside five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard smashed in his 15th goal of the season at Djordje Petrovic's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Petrovic redeemed himself for fault at the opening goal with two brilliant saves to turn away Havertz's low effort and a deflected shot by Trossard to keep his side in the game before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the floodgates opened once White curled in Arsenal's second after Chelsea failed to clear a corner on 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Odegaard's stunning through ball was then met with the finish it deserved as Havertz smashed high past Petrovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next finish was more subtle as the German international fired in off the post from Bukayo Saka's pass for his seventh goal in his last 14 club games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A night for forget for Chelsea was summed up by a sitter from Nicolas Jackson when he hit the side-netting with just David Raya to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And fortune was also not on Mauricio Pochettino's side when White's attempted cross flew into the top corner from another sensational Odegaard pass. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China condemned on Tuesday what it called "groundless accusations" by the United States that Beijing is supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The United States has unveiled a large-scale aid bill for Ukraine while also making groundless accusations against normal trade between China and Russia," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This kind of approach is extremely hypocritical and utterly irresponsible, and China is firmly opposed to it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang reiterated that China has consistently maintained that it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the Ukraine issue, China has always maintained an objective and just position, advocated actively for peace talks and pushed for a political resolution," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Beijing will not accept others "passing the buck" or shifting the blame. (AFP)

    'Productivity and quality key to HK's competitiveness'

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750376_1_L_20240425002313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) said new ways to increase economic productivity could help retain the SAR's status as a supply chain hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “New quality productive forces” — a concept introduced by President Xi Jinping and highlighted in Premier Li Qiang’s work report — refer to productivity increases helped by breakthroughs in technology, rather than in traditional industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, the council's executive director, Mohamed Butt, said new quality productive forces, also known as NPF, could help attract more businesses to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This NPF can empower the growth of new industrialisation, as well as enhance our capability to become a stronger base for exports. I think in the budget speech, the Secretary for Finance mentioned that Hong Kong needs to become an international supply chain hub," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In conclusion, I think NPF can really bring in new people, new ideas, new businesses, and enhance our capability to become a stronger base for supply chain hub for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of HKPC and lawmaker, Sunny Tan, said new quality productive forces could enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about being innovative, being able to apply new technologies in industrial development and the product development side with new products, new materials, new production processes, and also new ways of distribution," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, productive forces, really, it's about getting all stages, doing it right with, again, innovation and technology to enhance our competitiveness along the entire supply chain."

    Emergency appointments halved amid dentist shortage
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of emergency dental appointment slots at government clinics has fallen by almost half since the pandemic, the Audit Commission said on Wednesday, as it called for improvements to services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a report, the government auditor said there was an annual quota of around 40,000 appointment slots at the city’s 11 public dental clinics in the year 2018/19, but this had fallen to about 20,000 by 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It cited the Department of Health as saying the reduction was due to the pandemic, but also a shortage of dentists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said it found instances of people queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment the following day under the first-come-first served system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one clinic, people who had pre-registered to see the dentist still had to arrive in the morning to pick up a disc for an appointment that wasn’t until the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor noted that the government is aware of the public demand for more appointment slots for emergency dental care and urged it to address the manpower shortage and bring the quota back up to at least the level before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the public spending watchdog said health officials should beef up support for NGOs involved in the Outreach Dental Care Programme, which provides free dental services to elderly people in care homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the attendance rate for the programme needs to be improved, noting that the target of 43,000 service users was not met from 2020/21 to 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two NGOs served less than half the number of people they aimed to for three consecutive years, the auditor added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)
