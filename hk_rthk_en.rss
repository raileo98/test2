    Planning board urged to reject technopole plan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environmental groups on Tuesday urged the Town Planning Board to reject a government plan to build a technology hub at the site of fish ponds in the New Territories, warning it would cause damage to hundreds of hectares of wetland conservation area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their petition came as the board began a second meeting on the proposed San Tin Technopole plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Zimmerman, chief executive officer of Designing Hong Kong, was among those who submitted a petition letter to the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want the government to redraw the boundaries of the technopole and to respect the boundaries of the wetland conservation area and buffer area. It is a very simple request. These boundaries have been here for a long time, for a very good reason,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zimmerman said the area in question is of important significance to migratory birds and is an asset that belongs to citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Conservation Officer at the Hong Kong Birdwatching Society Wong Suet-mei urged the board to reconsider the government's plan to use wetland conservation area for the hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The planning this time relies very much on a just approved Environmental Impact Assessment, but we think the report is the worst one ever conducted in the past 30 years, ever since there are conservation policies in place. We hope the board can examine the assessment under proper circumstances,” Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former observatory chief Lam Chiu-ying, who also attended the meeting, said the development proposal would undermine Hong Kong’s contributions to China’s environmental conservation policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The filling of fish ponds... will make Hong Kong the underperformer in protecting the ecosystem in China. Is the technopole necessary? Are there any alternative locations for building the hub? And why is it a must to use wetland?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government says much of the land to be used for the technopole is of low ecological value and it will seek to avoid affecting the habitats and flight corridors of migratory birds as much as possible.

    InvestHK assists 322 companies in first half of 2024

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's investment promotion agency on Tuesday said it assisted 322 companies to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong in the first half of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was 43 percent more compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  InvestHK said the companies injected over HK$38.3 billion into the economy and created more than 3,500 jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the Director-General of Investment Promotion, Alpha Lau, said these companies are from 33 economies, with nearly half from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the mainland enterprises, over the past years, the percentage had always been hovering around 35 percent, because Hong Kong is an international city that's a springboard into the rest of the world," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are unlike any other Chinese city, which is why even Chinese enterprises have to come to Hong Kong. Most of them do anyway, to set up the first stepping stone or international headquarters to go outside of China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-four percent of the 322 firms helped so far this year are from the financial services and FinTech sectors, while 19 percent are from the innovation and technology industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau also said InvestHK is currently scrutinising 310 applications received since March for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, which aims to attract high-net-worth individuals to Hong Kong. She said she expects the scheme to bring in investments exceeding HK$9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, Lau said the agency will focus its promotional efforts in the coming months on the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as in the Middle East and North Africa.

    Mainland travel card for foreigners very popular: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new permit for non-Chinese permanent residents of Hong Kong to travel to the mainland without a visa is proving to be very popular, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service will issue the permits from July 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee described Beijing's move as a breakthrough that will "take good care" of foreign residents of the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we're going to improve the arrangements with the China Travel Service. We'll listen to views so as to optimise the arrangements," the CE said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District councillor and deputy school head Rizwan Ullah said ethnic minority residents often find the application process for travel visas to be complicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new card will make it more convenient for students to go on study trips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of InvestHK, Alpha Lau, said foreign residents are hailing the new arrangement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, in one day, I've already gotten a lot of very positive feedback from foreign chambers to say how wonderful the Hong Kong government is for doing this, for facilitating this together with the central government," she told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Grace Citizen’s young number nine, Li Hau-yi, is a rising star in women’s football in Hong Kong. She dreams of representing the SAR, but ironically, her path to success may first take her away from the city, where she can best develop her game by competing against elite players in a professional league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to be someone who contributes to Hong Kong’s football scene. My goal is to secure a ‘first eleven’ spot on the Hong Kong team. I also hope to be a role model for others; someone people are proud to have as a friend, or a family member," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To make the next step, the 17-year-old will have to take a break from her studies to move to a side in the Chinese Super League because Hong Kong does not have a professional women’s league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said this way, she can concentrate on the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think being a footballer in Hong Kong, in my experience, is quite difficult," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I go to school in the morning at eight, and then practise until around nine or ten in the evening. Sometimes I arrive home at eleven before having to wake up early again the next day," she said, describing her average day in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   </div>
   <br/>
   Li’s teammate, Iris Kwok, 30, knows a thing or two about the challenges of playing professionally outside of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok played in the territory’s amateur and semi-professional leagues for two decades before Spanish second-tier side Rayo Vallecano added her to their roster in March. Kwok said the transition was tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The playing-level is high there, whether that is the technique or physicality, so it took a bit of time to adapt. The players are very professional and they come really prepared. Their technique is incredible and their speed is fast so, after training with them, I feel like I have improved a lot."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But joining the squad partway through the season meant Kwok was unable to register with the Spanish league, and so did not feature for the Vallecano first team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_4_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Kwok’s coach at Citizen, Leung Kwun-chung, said he was not surprised his former captain caught the eye of an overseas side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leung noted that the path Kwok has gone down is one of the things that could benefit local football in the long term, adding that Kwok’s experience abroad had inspired her teammates at Citizen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I'm trying to provide more chances for the players to play at the highest level. And once they come back, supposedly the general standard, the club standard, or the level of Hong Kong will be increased."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_6_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br/>
     Leung has been coaching Grace Citizen for two years, but he is better known for his achievements as a player. The defender and midfielder has eleven caps for the Hong Kong men's international team, and has a Premier League trophy to his name with local side Tai Po.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, as a coach, he quickly learnt that the women's game is very different; with precious few resources, but plenty of potential.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Men's football in Hong Kong, maybe they've already got the model…You cannot change too much,” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "But the women's world is totally different. Maybe they’ve just started, it’s just the beginning. We don't have the professional league, and maybe one of the advantages of that is we don't have any limitations."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_8_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
      <div class="image-title-1">
       <span>
       </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Leung said he is trying to make the most of the resources he has at his disposal. That means he is boosting social media exposure, and trying to fill gaps in staffing to maximise players’ potential.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And all this, he hopes, will raise the profile of women’s football in the SAR and attract more money and resources to the sport.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Coach Leung's philosophy at Grace Citizen is having a knock-on effect among the younger members of his squad, one that is epitomised by Li.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I am so keen to go abroad, whenever more people are sent out, it rouses my determination, which makes me work harder, and believe in myself more.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping left Beijing on Tuesday for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and state visits to Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi's entourage includes Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written statement upon his arrival in the Kazakh capital of Astana later in the day, the president said he looks forward to attending the SCO summit and discussing with all parties the future of the organisation and ways to advance cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said China and Kazakhstan have established a unique permanent comprehensive strategic partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi will discuss with his SCO colleagues development blueprints and build consensus on cooperation in the two-day summit that opened on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Xi's trip to Kazakhstan – his fifth – he will also attend various state events, including a welcoming ceremony, signing ceremony and a banquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will hold "in depth" talks with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev "on bilateral relations, cooperation in key areas, and the regional and international landscape", Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi will then head to Tajikistan for his second state visit to China's western neighbour, where he will "make new plans for the growth of China-Tajikistan relations" with President Emomali Rahmon, Mao added. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong should capitalise on the measures announced by Beijing in supporting the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said an increase in duty-free allowance for mainland residents was something that was not easy to come by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Monday, the amount was tripled from 5,000 to 15,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This has been achieved after a lot of efforts by different ministries and authorities of the central government," Lee told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's important that we make good use of the new arrangement so that the benefits will be realised to its best potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said officials will keep reviewing different measures and discuss with the central authorities ways to enhance Hong Kong's economic development and tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said as Hong Kong's economy is in a transitional phase, people have to accept that and find ways to improve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can't rest on our own laurels to just think of present success or past successes... So I urge everybody to think of innovative ways to capitalise on the new measures that have been offered to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that various measures in support of Hong Kong can bring major synergy effects.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said authorities will head to Sichuan to discuss arrangements for Hong Kong to receive two pandas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on July 1 that the central government will send the pandas to the SAR as a gift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he hopes the pandas will arrive within a few months, and he believes they will attract tourists from around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether there will be a naming contest for the pandas, Lee said the government will first go to Sichuan to discuss details of the arrangement with mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the important thing is ensure that the arrangement for the giant pandas' arrival will be smooth and safe because I know that there will be quarantine requirements and all the necessary procedures need to be followed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have experience of receiving the gifts of giant pandas from central authorities, and Ocean Park has been doing an excellent job in ensuring that they are well taken care of."

    'Soft opening would have eased gridlock on new link'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759874_1_20240702092541.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link should have had a soft opening to reduce the mega infrastructure project's novelty factor, according to the CEO of a transport consultancy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new 24-kilometre link across the Pearl River Delta opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of the congestion we are seeing at the moment, those are just novelty factors," said Alok Jai, CEO of Trans-Consult, on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And normally when we open infrastructure like that, usually you should have a soft opening - which gives people the chance to take pictures and look around and appreciate it - before you do the full opening, or proper opening, then it becomes a proper transport linkage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in the gridlock. One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain welcomed the link, saying it would take pressure off the Humen Bridge at the north of the Pearl River Delta and improve connectivity within the region. But he said he didn't think it would cut journey times between Shenzhen and Zhongshan to 30 minutes from two hours, which had been widely reported ahead of the opening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is certainly going to reduce it by 45 minutes or so. But that in itself - as far as we talk about the connectivity within the Pearl River Delta, or the Greater Bay Area - that is a significant saving in journey times," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain also said he expected the new link to take traffic away from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which is more expensive. He said Hongkongers heading to Zhongshan may opt for the new link instead of going via Zhuhai. But he said the main beneficiaries would be those living in the Shenzhen or Zhongshan areas and those using the Humen Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link consists of two bridges, two artificial islands and an under-sea tunnel.

    Girmay first black African to win Tour de France stage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wanty's Biniam Girmay celebrates on the podium after winning stage 3. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759880_1_20240702082549.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eritrean Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory in stage three of the Tour de France on Monday as Richard Carapaz took the overall race lead in Turin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ecuador's Carapaz took the yellow jersey from overnight leader Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia. The pair are level on time. Remco Evenepoel and Jonas Vingegaard are third and fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intermarche rider Girmay, 24, who gave the Belgian team its first success on the Tour, is the third African to win on the Grande Boucle after South Africans Daryl Impey and Rob Hunter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple tour winner Chris Froome was born in Kenya but competed for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay won ahead of the Colombian Fernando Gaviria and Belgian Arnaud De Lie in a chaotic finale marked by a late fall as the riders hit speeds of around 65kph in the dash to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash, in which the big favourite for the sprint Jasper Philipsen was involved, created a break in the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time race winner Pogacar, gunning for a historic Giro-Tour double, did not fall but was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two sweltering stages, the skies were shrouded grey entering the northern Italian industrial city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay is more than just a sprinter, and was aided in his victory by the absence of stage favourite Philipsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He signalled his coming of age in 2022 when he became the first African to win a one-day classic at Gent-Wevelgem, aged 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was his second Grand Tour stage win after the Giro d'Italia in 2022 where he injured an eye opening a bottle of prosecco on the podium. (AFP)

    France, Portugal scramble into Euros last eight

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France have battled their way to the Euro 2024 quarter-finals despite a misfiring attack that once again failed to click in Monday's tense 1-0 win against Belgium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It took an own goal, the tournament's ninth, with just five minutes remaining in Duesseldorf to give France a nerve-jangling victory that raised fresh questions about the form of their key forwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While France celebrated Jan Vertonghen's own goal with gusto, boss Didier Deschamps acknowledged it could have been a far more comfortable passage to the last eight if they taken a host of earlier chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No France player has scored in open play in four matches in Germany as the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann struggle to reproduce the thrilling performances which carried Les Bleus to the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deschamps's side have been worryingly inaccurate in front of goal and they needed two fine saves from Mike Maignan to keep them on level terms before Vertonghen diverted Randal Kolo Muani's shot into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France had the better of possession, played and completed more passes and had 20 shots to Belgium's five but only worked Red Devils goalkeeper Koen Casteels once before Vertonghen's own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa saved three Slovenia penalties to earn his side a 3-0 shoot-out victory after Cristiano Ronaldo redeemed himself from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last 16 clash on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal forward Ronaldo broke down in tears after missing a penalty in the first period of extra-time in the goalless tie in Frankfurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he recovered to convert in the shoot-out as Portugal scraped through to set up a blockbuster clash with France in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia battled valiantly to keep Portugal at bay, with Jan Oblak making a stunning save to keep out Ronaldo's penalty after Diogo Jota was fouled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva all scored in the shoot-out and Slovenia's trio missed, sending the Selecao through in heart-stopping fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal coach Roberto Martinez reverted to a more familiar 4-3-3 system after his side were embarrassed by debutants Georgia in their last group game when he deployed three at the back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Euro 2016 winners dominated the ball and created their first chance after 12 minutes when Silva's inviting cross just evaded Ronaldo and Fernandes could not turn home at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia, playing in their first ever knock-out match at a major competition, maintained their defensive shape well and limited Portugal's opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Real Madrid striker Ronaldo directed a soft header at his old nemesis, Atletico Madrid keeper Oblak, under vital pressure from Vanja Drkusic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Slovenian defender was booked moments later for bringing down the surging Rafael Leao as he charged towards Oblak's goal. Ronaldo smashed the free-kick narrowly over the bar with the goalkeeper at full stretch. (AFP)

 Double Rugby World Cup winner Portia Woodman-Wickliffe said on Monday that she will retire from the sport after this summer's Paris Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Winger Woodman-Wickliffe, 32, and the Black Ferns are defending Olympic women's gold medal during the tournament in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the World Cup in the shorter form of the sport in 2013 and 2018 having lifted the 15s title in 2017 and 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After 12 incredible years representing New Zealand in 7s and 15s, the upcoming Paris Olympics will be my last time playing in the black jersey," Woodman-Wickliffe said on Instagram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rugby has provided me more than a career, it's given me a second whanau [family] in my sisters, opportunities to see the world and experience things I never would have otherwise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One last dance with my sisters in Paris," 2015's World Rugby sevens player of the year added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's sevens at the Paris Games begin on July 28 at the Stade de France with the gold medal match two days later. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq powered to a fresh record on Monday behind gains by tech giants, shrugging off an increase in US Treasury yields that analysts tied to shifting election expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shares of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all posted gains of at least two percent, adding to a buoyant 2024 so far for tech companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq jumped 0.8 percent to 17,879.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones advanced 0.1 percent to 39,169, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.3 percent to 5,475.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US bond yields climbed on Monday, a dynamic that typically sees a drag on equities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin attributed the rise in yields to a bet that Donald Trump will become the next US president, leading to an extension of tax cuts and pushing back Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rates are long and really going up in response to the shift in populism here and abroad, mostly here with the likelihood of Trump becoming president," Ablin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It looks like a higher for longer trade" in terms of US monetary policy, Ablin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A survey of manufacturers from the Institute for Supply Management's pointed to contraction, lagging expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Boeing rose 2.7 percent after announcing a deal to acquire subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems for US$4.7 billion, a move the aviation giant says will boost efforts to improve quality control. Spirit jumped 3.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Large banks rose after announcing a string of dividends and share repurchases late on Friday after passing annual Federal Reserve stress tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JPMorgan Chase gained 1.6 percent, Goldman Sachs won 2.5 percent and Bank of America 0.6 percent. (AFP)

 Hurricane Beryl slammed into the Caribbean island of Carriacou on Monday, producing "life-threatening conditions" including disastrous winds, according to US trackers, after the storm strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the "extremely dangerous eyewall" moving over the island, which is part of Grenada, the US National Hurricane Centre warned residents "not to leave their shelter as winds will rapidly increase."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eye of Beryl made landfall on Carriacou Island at 1510 GMT, the NHC reported on X, adding in a bulletin that it was creating "catastrophic winds and life-threatening storm surge."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Posting a video showing large waves, the Office of the Prime Minister of Grenada wrote on Facebook that the tri-island state was "experiencing intense winds and damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation," the NHC said. "Residents should not leave their shelter and remain in place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts say that such a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season – which runs from early June to late November – is extremely rare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July," hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell urged citizens to quickly seek shelter and respect an island-wide curfew ordered for 7:00 pm to 7:00 am Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farther northeast in the Caribbean, officials in Barbados said the island was buffeted by high winds and pelting rain, but appeared to have avoided disaster, reporting no injuries so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barbados seems to have "dodged a bullet," Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a video, but nonetheless "gusts are still coming, the storm-force winds are still coming" he said, warning residents to remain inside until the all-clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barbados, Grenada, plus Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago were all under hurricane warnings, the NHC said, while a hurricane watch or tropical storm warnings or watches were in effect for Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad, St Lucia, and parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A state of emergency was declared in Tobago, the smaller of the two islands that make up Trinidad and Tobago, with schools ordered closed on Monday, top official Farley Augustine said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A meeting this week in Grenada of the Caribbean regional bloc Caricom was postponed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl became the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season early on Saturday morning and quickly strengthened to Category 4, the first ever to reach that level in June, according to NHC records. (AFP)

 At least nine people were killed and four others were injured when a car struck pedestrians near Seoul city hall on Monday, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were six fatalities at the scene, while three others were pronounced dead after being rushed to hospital, firefighter Kim Chun-soo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that a 68-year-old driver crashed into people who were waiting at a traffic signal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was driving in the wrong direction and hit two other vehicles before ploughing into the pedestrians, Yonhap said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man was detained by police over the incident, said Kim Suk-hwan, safety and transport director at the city's Jung-gu district office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigations are underway to determine if drugs or alcohol were involved, as well as whether the deadly incident was caused by accidental acceleration, Kim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon described "a very sad accident" as he visited the crash site, according to city authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also ordered officials to "take the victims to the hospital quickly and thoroughly identify the cause of the accident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deadly transport accidents with multiple casualties are rare in South Korea, which generally has well-maintained roads and vehicles. (AFP)

    Court sends Trump's immunity case back to lower court

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Supreme Court on Monday ruled for the first time that former presidents have some immunity from prosecution, extending the delay in the Washington criminal case against Donald Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ending prospects the former president could be tried before the November election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an historic 6-3 ruling, the justices returned Trump's case to the trial court to determine what is left of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Trump. The outcome means additional delay before Trump could face trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court’s decision in a second major Trump case this term, along with its ruling rejecting efforts to bar him from the ballot because of his actions following the 2020 election, underscores the direct and possibly uncomfortable role the justices are playing in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. “And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roberts was joined by the other five conservative justices. The three liberal justices dissented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Today’s decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a scathing dissent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sotomayor, who read a summary of her dissent aloud in the courtroom, said the protection afforded presidents by the court "is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump posted on his social media network shortly after the decision was released: “BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!” (AP)

    Uefa investigating Jude Bellingham over rude gesture

<div class="itemFullText">
 England star Jude Bellingham is being investigated by Uefa over a potentially offensive gesture made during a European Championship win against Slovakia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uefa said on Monday it appointed a disciplinary inspector to look at “a potential violation of the basic rules of decent conduct.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham seemed to make a gesture with his hand toward his crotch after scoring an acrobatic stoppage-time equaliser before England went on to win 2-1 in extra time on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham's overhead kick with about 80 seconds left in the game saved England from a humiliating exit in the first knockout round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Uefa charges Bellingham in a disciplinary case he risks being suspended for the quarter-final against Switzerland on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Information on this matter will be made available in due course,” the European soccer body said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham took to social media late on Sunday to deny suggestions he gestured toward the Slovakia bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An inside joke gesture towards some close friends who were at the game. Nothing but respect for how that Slovakia team played tonight,” Bellingham wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A controversial spiritual leader in Nepal known as “Buddha Boy” has been sentenced to a 10-year prison term on Monday for sexually assaulting a minor, court officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ram Bahadur Bamjan – believed by some to be the reincarnation of the founder of Buddhism – was also ordered to pay US$3,700 in compensation to the victim by a judge at the Sarlahi District Court in southern Nepal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man will have 70 days to appeal against the court order, court official Sadan Adhikari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested Bomjan from a suburb in Nepal's capital Kathmandu in January on charges of sexual assault and suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of at least four of his followers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepalese banknotes worth US$227,000 and other foreign currencies amounting to US$23,000 were seized from him at the time of the arrest, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the court found him guilty of sexually assaulting an underage girl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges related to the disappearances of his followers are still pending trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bamjan is believed by many Nepalese to be the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama, who was born in southwestern Nepal some 2,600 years ago and became revered as the Buddha. Buddhist scholars have been sceptical of Bamjan’s claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bamjan became famous in southern Nepal in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His popularity has declined amid accusations of sexual and physical assaults on his followers, but he still maintains camps in southern Nepal where thousands come to worship or live. (AP)

    Macron and allies hope to block RN in second round

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French President Emmanuel Macron casts his vote in the first round. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759825_1_20240701173746.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron and his allies were on Monday beginning a week of intense campaigning ahead of the second round of legislative elections to prevent the far right from taking an absolute majority and control of government in a historic first.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The far-right National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Pen won a resounding victory in the first round of the polls on Sunday, with Macron's centrists trailing in third behind a left-wing coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the key suspense ahead of the second round on July 7 was whether the RN would win an absolute majority in the new National Assembly, enabling it to form a government and make Le Pen's protege Jordan Bardella, 28, prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most projections published by French polling organisations showed the RN falling short of an absolute majority, but the final outcome remains far from certain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hung parliament could lead to months of political paralysis and chaos -- just as Paris is preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer, and while France on the international stage takes a prime role in backing Ukraine against the Russian invasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who is likely to be forced to resign after the second round, warned that the far right was now at the "gates of power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RN should not get a "single vote" in the second round, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seven days to spare France from catastrophe," said Raphael Glucksmann, a key figure in the left-wing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RN garnered 33 percent of the vote, compared to 28 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and more than 20 percent for Macron's centrist camp, according to preliminary results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with less than 100 seats being decided outright in the first round, the final composition of the 577-seat National Assembly will only be clear after the second phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second round will see a three-way or two-way run-off in the remainder of the seats to be decided, with Macron's camp hoping that tactical voting will prevent the RN winning the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French stock market, which had been under considerable pressure in June amid the political uncertainty, also rallied in early trading on hopes the RN would not win an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron in a written statement urged a "broad" coalition against the far-right in the second round, amid controversy among supporters over whether they should tactically vote for the left where needed in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late Sunday police said some 8,000 left-wing supporters thronged the Place de la Republique in central Paris to denounce the prospect of the far right taking power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risk analysis firm Eurasia Group said the RN now looked "likely" to fall short of an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France was facing "at least 12 months with a rancorously blocked National Assembly and -- at best -- a technocratic government of 'national unity' with limited capacity to govern", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-leaning newspaper Liberation in an editorial called on Macron to remove all his alliance's candidates from districts when they had arrived in third place to give the left-wing alliance a chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The head of state has thrown France under the bus. The bus has continued its course unimpeded, and is now parked in front of the gates of Matignon", the prime minister's office, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrival of the anti-immigration and eurosceptic RN in government would be a turning point in French modern history: the first time a far-right force has taken power in the country since World War II, when it was occupied by Nazi Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella said he wanted to be the "prime minister of all French".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would create a tense period of "cohabitation" with Macron, who has vowed to serve out his term until 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella has said he will only form a government if the RN wins an absolute majority in the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rancour remained over Macron's decision to call the election in the first place, a move he took with only a tight circle of advisers in the hours after his party was trounced by the RN in European elections this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chaos risks damaging the international credibility of Macron, regarded by some as the European Union's number-one leader and who immediately after the second round will attend the Nato summit in Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The right-wing Le Figaro in its editorial lamented a "disaster" brought about by the "unfathomable lightness of a man, through narcissist rancour, took the risk of plunging his country into chaos". (AFP)

    HKers and tourists enjoy July 1 goodies

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers and tourists enjoyed a wide range of freebies and discounts on Monday as the city celebrated July 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Many took advantage of the free light rail and tram trips on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There happened to be a free tram service, so I feel really lucky. It shows the characteristics of Hong Kong, so I want to experience this," a mainland tourist told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really interested in its double-decker design."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man said despite the tram rides being free, there weren’t too many passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe a lot of Hong Kong people went up to the mainland during this three-day holiday, so there aren't many people... Because there are too many people crossing the border, so we tried to avoid going to the mainland during this period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other people, meanwhile, took the opportunity to visit museums for free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A girl said she enjoyed her trip to the Science Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy because I don't have to spend money for tickets. I can also go and play everywhere and I don't have to go to school," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man visited the M+ Museum at the West Kowloon Cultural District for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't come if I have to pay... I came [an hour] earlier because I can queue indoor and enjoy the air conditioning," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, not everybody was aware of the promotions on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now discovered that there're discounts and freebies offered, and these may also have contributed to the festive atmosphere. But we didn't know about that before, so more promotion may be needed," a woman said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has expressed joy over the central government’s decision to send two pandas to Hong Kong as gifts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The park’s chairman, Paulo Pong, said preparations are now underway to receive the new guests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with Ying Ying and Le Le, the new giant pandas will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China with Hong Kong citizens and tourists,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Ocean Park is deeply grateful for the trust placed in us by the central government and the HKSAR government to care for our national treasures.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A regular visitor to Ocean Park told RTHK that she’s very excited about the new pandas, saying she hopes they can be named "Economy" and "Takeoff".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am really looking forward to it. The panda frenzy can boost the economy... I hope they will have panda babies," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two tourists from the mainland, meanwhile, said they will come to Hong Kong again when the new pandas arrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We couldn't see any pandas when we went to Sichuan. We'd be really thrilled if we can see some in Hong Kong," they said.

 A woman has been charged with murdering her husband in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday night, and she's due to appear in Kwun Tong Court on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The woman, 32, was arrested after she allegedly slashed her sleeping husband with a fruit knife in their flat at LOHAS Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man, 30, suffered multiple wounds and was certified dead at hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers earlier said they were probing the suspect's motives, noting that she had suffered from depression since giving birth around a year and a half ago.

    'Do more to ease traffic on Shenzhen-Zhongshan link'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector representatives have called on mainland officials to do more to smooth out traffic on the new Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, after commuters experienced much longer journey times than expected amid heavy congestion on its opening day on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new mega-project - which comprises two bridges, two artificial islands, and a tunnel – was supposed to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in a gridlock for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some vehicles stopped on the bridge and people were taking photos. There should have been four lanes available, but when the problem was at its peak, there were only two," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The traffic capacity was reduced by half, leading to traffic congestion. Transport departments and officers could have done better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, pointed out that it took him about five hours to reach Shenzhen from Zhongshan on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes mainland authorities will handle the issue by, for example, banning commuters from taking photos on bridges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will keep an eye on the situation for one or two more weeks. I will also see what happens this coming Saturday and Sunday," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will make decisions on tour group arrangements depending on the traffic situation, especially for those heading to the west side of the Pearl River Delta. I think we'll have to keep things flexible and people on tours should be aware of this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach operator Eternal East Bus, meanwhile, said it anticipates a 30 percent jump in passenger numbers with the opening of the new link, and will increase the frequency of buses to Zhongshan accordingly.

    Non-Chinese HK residents to get mainland travel cards

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Authorities said non-Chinese permanent residents can start applying for the mainland travel permit from July 10. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759771_1_20240701105809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing announced on Monday that non-Chinese Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents can soon apply for mainland travel permits, eliminating their need for visas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Immigration Administration said the move is to facilitate cross-border personnel exchanges, and support the integration of the two SARs into the national development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 10, eligible persons can apply for the permit by visiting a China Travel Service outlet in person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The permit will be valid for five years, and holders can enter the mainland multiple times during the period. They can stay up to 90 days per visit," the administration said in an online announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Permit holders will be able to cross the border through e-channels after having their fingerprints collected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they will not be allowed to work, study or engage in activities such as news gathering on the mainland. Those who intend to do so need to apply separately to relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities hope the new policy will make it more convenient for personnel exchanges in areas such as businesses and investment, cultural and tourism as well as education and research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Hong Kong government welcomed the new policy, saying it will greatly enhance border clearance efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee added that it demonstrates the country's care and support for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents have deep roots in Hong Kong. They have been working diligently and making significant contributions to the development of Hong Kong," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure is not limited to any nationality or industry, which fully highlights Hong Kong's unique status under 'one country, two systems' and greatly helps Hong Kong maintain its international character and diversity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials have been in close communication with their mainland counterparts in facilitating the flow of talent across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Austrian Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong and Macau also welcomed the arrangement, saying it saves business travellers precious time while those with family ties in the SAR can also take advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As far as I understand, [the arrangement] even applies for children," chairman Wilhelm Brauner said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, it makes your business travel easy, but you can even now extend it to your family and take advantage of these improved procedures to take your family to [mainland China] on a weekend - or on an extended weekend holiday - whatever you might want to do,” he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 17-year-old Chinese player has died after collapsing on court during an international tournament in Indonesia, badminton officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang Zhijie was taken ill during a match late on Sunday against Japan's Kazuma Kawano at the Asian Junior Badminton Mixed Team Championships in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The score was 11-11 in the first game when Zhang suddenly fell to the floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A doctor and medical team were quickly on the scene and he was taken to hospital by ambulance within minutes, but passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China's Zhang Zhijie, a singles player, collapsed on the court during a match in the evening," Badminton Asia and the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was sent to the hospital where he passed away at 23:20 local time yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was attended to by the tournament doctor and medical team. He was taken in the standby ambulance in less than two minutes and sent to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Badminton Asia, PBSI and the organising committee are immensely saddened and expressed their deepest condolences to Zhang's parents, family, and the Chinese Badminton Association."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The world of badminton has lost a talented player," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry expressed condolences to Zhang's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ministry will continue to guide the Chinese consulate in Surabaya to conduct follow-up work," spokesperson Mao Ning said in a daily press conference. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Monday that Beijing is to send two pandas to Hong Kong as gifts, as he led top officials and political heavyweights in attending activities marking the 27th anniversary of SAR Establishment Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At 8am, the CE and more than a hundred guests attended the flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those in attendance were the director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, former Chief Executives Donald Tsang, CY Leung and Carrie Lam, as well as Chief Justice Andrew Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the national and SAR flags were being raised, the guests all stood solemnly facing them while the national anthem was being played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disciplined forces, such as the Government Flying Service and Fire Services Department, gave their salute at Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the brief ceremony outdoors, the guests headed to a reception inside the Convention and Exhibition Centre next door.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the reception speech, the CE announced that Beijing will be sending two pandas to Hong Kong, with the pair being the fifth and sixth pandas to live in Ocean Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I sincerely thank the central government's care and support for the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The officials took up my proposal to send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts. We are immediately starting preparations to receive them in a few months, and they'll bring us joy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said this is just the first of many good news to come for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive also spoke about the work of the SAR government over the past year, including enacting homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law, as well as attracting more skilled workers to come to Hong Kong.

    South Korean factory activity grows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korea's exports have been growing since October. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759748_1_20240701092022.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's factory activity growth quickened in June to the fastest in 26 months, as new orders jumped on improving global demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The purchasing managers index (PMI) for manufacturers in Asia's fourth-largest economy, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 52.0 in June, from 51.6 in May, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the highest reading since April 2022, staying above the 50-mark, which separates expansion from contraction, for a second consecutive month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another strong month of data provides further evidence that global industrial activity and trade are picking up," said Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Viewed as a bellwether for exports due to its integration in supply chains for key intermediate goods like batteries and semiconductors, South Korean manufacturing output and orders often provide leading signals for trends more broadly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New orders expanded at the quickest rate since February 2022 on stronger demand both at home and abroad, with those from overseas increasing the most in five months, sub-indexes showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asian countries including China, Vietnam and Japan, as well as other regions such as North America and Europe were cited in the survey as markets that yielded sales growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's exports, which have been growing since October led by demand for computer chips and from the United States, are recovering towards record-high levels, the finance minister said last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Output rose for a third straight month in June but at a slower rate than the month before. Stocks of finished goods were depleted by the most in nearly three years and backlogs of work rose by the most in almost two years, suggesting that factory capacity was somewhat stretched amid growing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, inflation in input prices accelerated to the fastest in eight months, with companies attributing the rise to unfavourable exchange rate movements and a rise in raw material prices, namely for metals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead dropped to the weakest in six months, as concerns grew that domestic market conditions could hinder factory output despite positive sales forecasts. (Reuters)

    North Korea launches two ballistic missiles

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Last week, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a multiple warhead missile, also this was disputed by the South. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759742_1_20240701085745.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea on Monday launched two ballistic missiles, South Korea's military confirmed -- the latest in a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang that have soured relations with Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A short-range ballistic missile was launched in the early morning hours, the South's military Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. About 10 minutes later, a second missile, this one as yet unidentified, was detected, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our military has strengthened surveillance and vigilance in preparation for further launches," the JCS said, adding it had shared information about the incidents with the United States and Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not offer immediate confirmation of the launches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a multiple warhead missile, but the South said that launch ended in a mid-air explosion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing while bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang says those missives are in retaliation for balloons loaded with anti-regime propaganda leaflets sent northwards by activists in the South.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the North's repeated launches, South Korea has fully suspended a tension-reducing military treaty. It also resumed propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts and live-fire drills near the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea also has grown anxious over the North's warming relations with its isolated neighbour Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea is accused of breaching arms control measures by supplying weapons to Russia to use in its war in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in June in a show of unity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Pyongyang condemned joint military drills by South Korea, Japan and the United States, calling them an "Asian version of Nato" and warning of "fatal consequences".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-day "Freedom Edge" exercises included preparation in ballistic missile and air defences, anti-submarine warfare and defensive cyber training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang has always decried similar combined exercises as rehearsals for an invasion, but Seoul said Sunday the latest exercises were a continuation of defensive drills held regularly for years. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodri, Fabian Ruiz, Nico Williams and Dani Olmo all scored as Spain came from behind to beat surprise package Georgia 4-1 at Euro 2024 on Sunday and set up a blockbuster quarter-final against hosts Germany.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Robin Le Normand's own goal gave Georgia a shock lead in the 18th minute of this last-16 tie to send their noisy supporters wild in Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first goal Spain had conceded at the competition but they came back to equalise six minutes before the interval courtesy of Manchester City midfielder Rodri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz then headed home in the 51st minute and Williams ran through for the third before substitute Olmo made sure of the win as La Roja stay on track to become European champions for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain now take on Germany in the last eight in Stuttgart on Friday in a repeat of the Euro 2008 final, which they won 1-0 to begin their golden era of dominance in international football.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luis de la Fuente's current team are looking to bring back the glory days and they were expected to brush Georgia aside here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They would have ultimately won by a far greater margin had they converted more of their chances, with 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal squandering several opportunities in his attempt to become the youngest ever goal-scorer at the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia are ranked 74th in the world, 66 places below Spain. Willy Sagnol's team lost twice to Spain in qualifying, going down 7-1 at home and 3-1 away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet they still qualified for a first major tournament and then made it to the knockout stages with a stunning 2-0 win over Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagnol said on the eve of this match that his unfancied team had "already won the European Championship" thanks to their remarkable run, and they now go home with their heads held high despite eventually crumbling here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have a lively attacking partnership between Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Georges Mikautadze that is a danger for any opponent, and Giorgi Mamardashvili has been one of the best goalkeepers at the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mamardashvili had already saved from Pedri and kept out Dani Carvajal's glancing header before Georgia went ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move started with a fine piece of play by Kvaratskhelia, who had little room to manoeuvre on the left wing but picked out a pass for Mikautadze, who then released Otar Kakabadze on the right wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kakabadze's cross into the box was a horrible one for Le Normand, who had Kvaratskhelia arriving behind him and could not stop the ball rebounding off him and into the net for the eighth own goal of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain were now vulnerable to the counterattack, which is Georgia's strength, but the men in red continued to dominate the game and kept testing Mamardashvili.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Valencia shot-stopper made several more interventions in an increasingly wild encounter before the equaliser finally came, Rodri controlling a Williams pass at the edge of the box and stroking the ball into the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It felt as if that might be that for Georgia, but they remained audacious on the break, with Kvaratskhelia almost scoring from inside his own half at the beginning of the second period, his shot going just wide with goalkeeper Unai Simon out of position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain went ahead shortly after, as Yamal crossed from the right for Ruiz to head in his second goal of the tournament at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal didn't just miss chances of his own, as he also forced an own goal which was disallowed for offside before Georgia fell apart defensively under increasingly heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz released Williams, who ran from inside his own half, skipped past Giorgi Gvelesiani into the box and fired into the roof of the net to make it 3-1 on 75 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A delightful control and finish from the edge of the box by Olmo completed the scoring with seven minutes left. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jude Bellingham's spectacular bicycle kick saves England's blushes. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759726_1_20240701034625.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England escaped an embarrassing last 16 exit at Euro 2024 thanks to Jude Bellingham's overhead kick before Harry Kane struck in extra-time for a 2-1 win over Slovakia on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Three Lions have been hyped as one of the favourites to end a 58-year wait for major tournament glory but looked set to go out with a whimper to Ivan Schranz's 25th minute goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Bellingham's moment of inspiration five minutes into six added on in stoppage time breathed new life into Gareth Southgate's reign as England boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane then headed in just a minute into extra-time to set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate looked certain to fall on his sword after steadfastly refusing to make changes to a side that stumbled through as winners of Group C despite scoring just two goals in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobbie Mainoo was introduced for his first competitive start in Southgate's only change and he paid the price with another lacklustre display lacking in any speed or invention for long spells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one saving grace of England's performances in the group stage was that a makeshift defence had held up well, conceding just once in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they were torn to pieces early on by a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England did not heed a couple of warnings as David Hancko and Lukas Haraslin were wasteful with big chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia finally punished their more illustrious opponents when David Strelec was given acres of room to turn and play in Schranz, who confidently stroked past Jordan Pickford for his third goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his lack of experience, Mainoo was one of the few players that threatened to spark England into life as the Manchester United midfielder's effort was deflected wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The half-time whistle was met with a chorus of boos but Southgate still stuck to his guns and did not make a change until 25 minutes to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England did at least improve on a dismal first half and had the ball in the net within five minutes of the restart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Foden turned in Kieran Trippier's cross but was caught offside after a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia should have doubled their lead shortly afterwards when England gave away possession and Strelec saw Pickford well off his line but failed to hit the target from the halfway line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate's hand was finally forced on 66 minutes by an injury to Trippier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the major calls the England boss will come to regret is only naming one natural left-back in his 26-man squad in Luke Shaw, who has not played a minute for club or country since February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Shaw not match-fit, Bukayo Saka was forced to deputise at left-back to make room for the introduction of Cole Palmer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's chances seemed to have gone when Kane headed wide a golden opportunity and Declan Rice smashed the post with a long-range pot shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate was even derided by the England support for bringing on Ivan Toney deep into stoppage time with chants of "you don't know what you're doing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, there was an incredible twist as Bellingham acrobatically turned home Guehi's flick-on from a throw-in the final moments of added-on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia were suddenly rattled and Toney was to have a telling contribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brentford striker headed Eberechi Eze's mishit shot back across goal for Kane to power home his second goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia should still have taken the game to penalties when full-back Peter Pekarik failed to turn in a dangerous driven cross from point-blank range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But England live to fight another day come the quarter-final against an impressive Switzerland, who comfortably knocked out holders Italy 2-0 on Saturday. (AFP)

    French far right wins election first round: estimates

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Emmanuel Macron has called for a "broad" alliance against the far right in the second round. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759720_1_20240701022400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's far right won the first round of pivotal legislative elections on Sunday with the centrist forces of President Emmanuel Macron coming in only third behind the left after the highest turnout in over four decades, estimates said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it remained unclear if the far-right National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Penn would win an absolute majority of seats in the new National Assembly lower house in the July 7 second round and allow her to claim claim the post of prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron had stunned the nation and baffled even some allies by calling snap polls after the RN trounced his centrist forces in European Parliament elections this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gamble risks backfiring, with Macron's alliance now expected to win a far smaller minority contingent in parliament, making the president a far less powerful figure for the remaining three years of his term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Projections from prominent French polling firms gave the RN 34.5 percent of the vote, compared to 28.5-29.1 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 20.5-21.5 percent for Macron's centrist camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The polling agencies projected this would give the RN a majority of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after the second round and a possible absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Macron called for a "broad" alliance against the far right in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the French facing their most polarising choices in recent history, turnout soared. The Elabe organisation projecting a final turnout of 67.5 percent, the highest participation in a regular format legislative election in France since 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final turnout in 2022 was just 47.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The July 7 second round will see run-off votes take place in seats where there was no absolute majority, allowing the final composition of the National Assembly to take shape. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two large wildfires were burning on Sunday near Greece's capital of Athens, and authorities sent emergency messages for some residents to evacuate and others to stay at home and close their windows to protect themselves from smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first blaze, southeast of Athens, began in the early afternoon. Local authorities said it burned at least four homes and several cars. No casualties were reported by 6 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blaze was approaching the port of Lavrio about 60 kilometers southeast of Athens. The area has suffered from wildfires in recent years. A small forest to the south, near Cape Sounio, also could be in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second, fast-moving fire later began north of Athens near the suburb of Stamata. It was burning through scrubland and forest and moving up 1,100-metre Mount Penteli, one of four mountains ringing the capital area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 230 firefighters, 17 planes and 12 helicopters were trying to put out both fires, the Fire Service said. The planes and helicopters can only operate in daylight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hot and dry weather, combined with strong winds, are helping spread the fires. Temperatures in the low 30s Celsius are expected to rise on Monday and Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires have become an annual feature in the Mediterranean. Earlier this month, Greece and Turkey saw large fires. (AFP)

 Hundreds of people marched in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Sunday, in tribute to those who died in anti-government demonstrations this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to NGOs, at least 30 people died in protests driven by a government drive to substantially raise taxes in the East African country – although the government has not given any official toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largely peaceful rallies turned violent last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the deeply unpopular tax increases following pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police opened fire on protesters who stormed the parliament complex and a fire broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clashes were unprecedented in the history of the country since its independence from Britain in 1963.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, a few hundred people gathered in Uhuru Park in central Nairobi following an appeal on central media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After singing and lighting candles, they waved Kenyan flags and chanted as they marched past the hospital where some of the injured protesters are being treated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators dispersed peacefully late in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the protests turned deadly on June 25, President William Ruto's administration ultimately withdrew the bill. (AFP)

 Mercedes' George Russell was gifted a win in the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday after a dramatic late collision between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pole sitter Verstappen had to settle for fifth after leading for much of the race while Norris was forced to retire his McLaren after a nip and tuck battle between the pair for the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Piastri in the other McLaren took second with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz completing the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell said: "Incredible, it was a tough fight, starting in third. I was watching on the big screen and knew Lando would try and get that race win, but the team has done a great job to get us in the fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So proud to be back on the top step," added the British driver, who notched up Mercedes' last win in Brazil in 2022. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ferocious storms and torrential rains that lashed France, Switzerland and Italy this weekend have left seven people dead, local authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three people in their 70s and 80s died in France's northeastern Aube region on Saturday when a tree crushed the car they were travelling in during fierce winds, the local authority said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth passenger was in critical care, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Switzerland, four people have died and another is missing, according to local police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three were killed after torrential rains triggered a landslide in the southeast, police in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man was also found dead in a hotel in Saas-Grun in the southwest canton of Valais, police said, adding that he was probably taken by surprise by a sudden rapid rise in floodwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man is also missing in Valais, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The civil security services said "several hundred" people were evacuated in Valais and roads closed after the Rhone and its tributaries overflowed in different locations.

  Emergency services were assessing the best way to evacuate 300 people who had arrived for a football tournament in Peccia, while almost 70 more were being evacuated from a holiday camp in the village of Mogno.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The poor weather was making rescue work particularly difficult, police had said earlier, with several valleys inaccessible and cut off from the electricity network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The federal alert system also said part of the canton was without drinking water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extreme rainfall also struck southeastern Switzerland last weekend, leaving one dead and causing major damage.

  In northern Italy's Aosta Valley, internet users shared images of spectacular floods and swollen rivers rushing down mountain slopes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An official factory survey on Sunday showed manufacturing on the mainland contracting for a second month in June. But the non-manufacturing sector - which includes services and construction - continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official purchasing managers' index, or PMI, is a broad survey of sentiment among factory owners. It came in at 49.5 for June and, although the figure was unchanged from May, a number below the 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI fell to 50.5 from 51.1 in May. The figure, which is the lowest since December, suggests consumers are still cautious, even as the sector grows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts now expect Beijing to roll out more policy support measures in the short term, while a government pledge to boost fiscal stimulus is seen helping kick domestic consumption into a higher gear.

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link officially opens

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Sunday welcomed the opening of a road link that spans the Pearl River Delta and connects Shenzhen with Zhongshan, saying that it helps to promote market integration in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, which opened on Sunday afternoon, is expected to cut the journey time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, traffic jams at both ends of the link marred the first day of operation, and some people complained the journey took much longer than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi said it's necessary to ensure the link is safe and smooth, and that it will help integrate the eastern and western sides of the Pearl River Delta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said he expects it to be a popular tourist spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One out of two enquiries have been asking about the Shenzhen-Zhongshan link for single-day or multi-day tour groups. Customers hope to go to Zhongshan, Shunde or Gudou and spend three days there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man travelling to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong by tour bus said he now expects the journey to be more convenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I travelled to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong before, I had to go via Shenzhen Bay and Humen. It took me five-and-a-half hours. I want to see whether taking the link will cut my journey time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A restaurant manager in Zhongshan said he expects business to increase after the opening of the transport link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong tour groups contribute to half of our sales for group dining. After the opening of the link, many travel agencies, which didn't previously partner with us, also came to our restaurant to have a look at the environment and the food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The link is 24 kilometres in length and consists of two bridges, two artificial islands, and a two-way, eight-lane tunnel.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Five people, including a four-year-old child, were killed in a massive explosion at a pyrotechnics warehouse in the southern Philippines, emergency services said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Saturday afternoon blast at the Zamboanga City site tore a large hole in the ground, sent debris careening into nearby buildings and houses and ignited a blaze, fire investigator Luigi Chan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four warehouse workers and the four-year-old son of one of the staffers were killed, Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city disaster office confirmed the death toll and said another 38 people had been injured in the incident, eight of them seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said they are investigating the cause of the explosion, which created a 20-metre (66-foot) crater, dismantled the depot's walls and rained rubble on a nearby soft drinks factory, a grains and flour warehouse and area homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most probable origin of the fire is the pyrotechnics stored at the warehouse," Chan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the blast radius extended more than 3,000 square metres (0.8 acres) and it took firefighters more than two hours to bring the blaze under control. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive, John Lee, on Sunday said Hong Kong currently has more opportunities than challenges, and the city has to grasp the chance to create more achievements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video marking two years of the current administration, Lee said now is the time for Hong Kong to advance from stability to prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are more opportunities than challenges. Hong Kong society is generally safe and stable now, so it's the best time for development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be innovative while having bottom-line thinking. We have to make timely and appropriate measures according to local conditions when formulating policies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that there were still external challenges, but that Hong Kong would make best use of its advantages.

    Woman arrested after alleged murder at Lohas Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they had arrested a 32-year-old woman on suspicion of murder after her 30-year-old husband was found dead from a knife wound at a flat in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they had received a report about the incident from the suspect's father-in-law at 11.50 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police rushed to the scene and found the man on the sofa with injuries to his neck. He was sent to Tseung Kwan O Hospital in an unconscious state, where he was declared dead just after 12.30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, assistant district commander Tsang Chun-kit said initial enquiries suggested the woman may have been suffering from depression after giving birth to her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to thoroughly investigate her motive. The mental state of the suspect is one of the key areas that our investigation will focus on. This is because the suspect experienced significant depression after giving birth to her son. She had sought regular treatment from a private doctor," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the couple had been married for five years and had no apparent financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that at the time of the incident, their one-and-a-half-year-old son was being taken care of by his paternal grandfather.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, on Sunday said it's time for Hong Kong to take a step forward, after being in a defensive position over the past few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Chan said the city had been safeguarding its financial security and economy since 2019 due to the social unrest and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government is working to boost the economy, despite the presence of external challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the short term, we are holding many mega events and inviting people to visit Hong Kong. We hope to make our city more lively and prosperous. After the pandemic, fewer people are coming here, and Western countries may have misunderstandings about Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But businesses, who have come in recent months, feel positive about Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said some countries had criticised but they had been proved wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some said Hong Kong is no longer a financial centre, and that there was an outflow of capital. But if we look at the data, when they were making these slanders in 2023, we still saw a net capital inflow," he said.

    MTR fare rise of 3.09 percent kicks in

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR is offering a complimentary ride for passengers who make 10 trips on the rail network between July 1 and July 28. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759650_1_20240630114507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fares on the MTR rose by 3.09 percent on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The MTR had initially sought 3.2 percent but the government's affordability cap - which is based on the median monthly household income - limited the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase means that an adult passenger using an Octopus card to make the long journey between Tung Chung to Hong Kong Station will have to pay 70 cents more, bringing the total fare to HK$24.3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cushion the initial blow, the rail operator is offering a complimentary ride for passengers who make 10 trips on the rail network between July 1 and July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, this offer is only available to adult passengers who have linked their Octopus cards to the MTR Mobile app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also excludes the Airport Express and Light Rail.

    Police raid offices of Thales in three countries

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759642_1_20240630100527.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French defence group Thales faced fresh questions Saturday after police in three countries searched its offices this week as part of two separate corruption investigations, a judicial source told AFP.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers in France, the Netherlands and Spain carried out the searches between Wednesday and Friday, said the source, confirming a report from French broadcaster BFMTV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police searches were triggered by two separate investigations, the source added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first, opened at the end of 2016, into suspected corruption of a foreign official, criminal association and money laundering involved the sale of submarines and the construction of naval base in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second, opened in June 2023, concerned similar offences linked to the sale of military and civilian equipment abroad, the source added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thales confirms that the searches have taken place," the company told AFP Saturday. "The group is cooperating with the competent authorities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an official visit to Rio de Janeiro in 2008, France's then president Nicolas Sarkozy signed a contract with Brazil for the sale of four Scorpene-class submarines for 5.2 billion euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessels incorporated parts supplied by Thales and three of the submarines have already been delivered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second element of the deal was the construction of a naval base and a submarine construction site at Itaguai, which was inaugurated in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second investigation opened in June 2023, said the judicial source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This case is a collaboration by investigators in France, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as official from Eurojust, the European Union agency for criminal justice cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales, in its response to AFP Saturday evening, stressed that it "strictly conforms to national and international regulations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company had developed and implemented a programme designed to ensure it met the highest industry standards, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales has previously been investigated for alleged corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris investigating magistrate is due to decide shortly whether to follow the recommendations of the prosecutor at the financial crimes office and put a subsidiary of Thales on trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DCNI, part of the group's naval wing, is under investigation over the sale of submarines to Malaysia in 2002.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it emerged in May 2023 that financial prosecutors had also opened a preliminary investigation into how Thales won a contract to refit India's Mirage-2000 fighter jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales has denied any wrongdoing in the affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another investigation, opened in December 2020, is looking at the transfer of a former Thales employee to a key post at the United Nations, one of the defence company's clients. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French people vote on Sunday in high-stakes snap parliamentary elections which could alter France's trajectory and see the far-right party of Marine Le Pen take power in a historic first.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With Russia's war against Ukraine in its third year and energy and food prices much higher, support for the anti-immigration and eurosceptic National Rally (RN) party has surged despite President Emmanuel Macron's pledges to prevent its ascent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polling stations open across mainland France for the first round of elections at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) and close 12 hours later, immediately followed by projections that usually predict the result with a degree of accuracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voters in France's overseas territories that span the globe cast ballots earlier in the weekend. Some 49 million French are eligible to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round, a week later, on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls show that National Rally is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the RN obtains an absolute majority, RN party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense "cohabitation" with Macron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse," Rahman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, thousands of people joined an LGBT Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms," said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has deplored "racism or anti-Semitism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off. The party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!" Le Pen wrote on social media platform X on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Le Pen and Bardella have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a "civil war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins. (AFP)

 Police on Saturday arrested a 55-year-old man after he was allegedly found carrying a bullet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said that at 6 pm, officers had been patrolling Nam Ning Street in Aberdeen, when they saw a man who they believed to be acting suspiciously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said officers stopped and searched the man and a bullet was found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers then arrested the man on suspicion of possessing ammunition without a license.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday morning, police said the man had not been charged, although he remains in detention.

<div class="itemFullText">
 India beat South Africa by seven runs in a heart-stopping final to win the Twenty20 World Cup at the Kensington Oval on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Electing to bat on a dry surface, 2007 champions India overcame a top-order meltdown to post a competitive 176-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Virat Kohli (76) struck his first 50 of this World Cup and Axar Patel smashed 47 to power India to a healthy total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anrich Nortje and Keshav Maharaj claimed two wickets apiece for South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Proteas suffered a top order collapse of their own but Quinton de Kock (39) and Tristan Stubbs (31) put their chase back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heinrich Klaasen (52) then counter-attacked in spectacular fashion but India's impeccable death-overs bowling restricted South Africa to 169-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, Kohli confirmed that he was quitting T20 Internationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was my last T20 game playing for India," player-of-the-match Kohli said following India's victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Time for the next generation to take the T20 game forward."  (Reuters)

    Switzerland dispatch Italy; Germany beat Denmark

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Italy's Alessandro Bastoni slumps on the pitch after the match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759626_1_20240630022211.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of superb strikes from Remo Freuler and Ruben Vargas for Switzerland sent defending champions Italy crashing out of the European soccer championship in the round of 16 after a sloppy, rudderless display by Luciano Spalletti's side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Though the Swiss defended well, the Italians made their job all the easier with bad passing and poor-decision-making, giving the ball away cheaply in central positions and failing to press with any vigour as they headed for the exit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a slow, tenuous start on a sweltering evening in Berlin, Switzerland should have taken the lead in the 24th minute when Breel Embolo was played in, but his attempt to wait out Gianluigi Donnarumma didn't succeed and the Italian goalkeeper comfortably parried his curled shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking far more like defending champions than the men in blue, the Swiss breakthrough came 13 minutes later with brilliantly-worked goal as they pulled the Italians out of position, Freuler hammering the ball home from a pin-point pass by Vargas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whatever Spalletti said at half-time did not have the desired effect and his side were two down within a minute, with Italy's ponderous, flat-footed defence taking on a spectator's role as Vargas curled a stunning shot into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss almost threw the Italians a lifeline in the 51st minute as Fabian Schaer's glancing header wrong-footed keeper Yann Sommer, leaving him to watch helplessly as the ball bounced up and kissed the far post before being cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the clock ticking ominously, the Italian players seemed paralysed in the face of the Swiss defence, resorting to speculative long shots that did little to trouble Sommer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woodwork intervened again in the 74th minute as Gianluca Scammacca scuffed the ball onto the near post from close range but that was as close as they came, and Italian fans were streaming out of the stands long before the final whistle, with those left in their seats dumbstruck by their team's insipid performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That goal at the start of the second half cut our legs, we weren't very incisive," said Italian coach Spalletti after the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What made the difference is the pace, we had a pace that was too inferior to them in the first half. Even in the individual players there was a different pace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other game, a Kai Havertz penalty and a Jamal Musiala strike gave Germany a 2-0 win over Denmark as the host nation reached the quarter-finals after a dramatic game that was delayed by almost half an hour in the first half due to a violent storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Havertz stroked home from the spot early in the second half in Dortmund following a handball by Joachim Andersen, the unlucky Danish defender who had a goal disallowed at the other end only moments earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musiala, of Bayern Munich, then ran away to stroke in the second goal midway through the second half as Germany's class told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one point it looked as if the game could be abandoned as English referee Michael Oliver stopped play in the 35th minute of the first half and took the teams off the pitch while a violent storm passed overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain, hailstones, high winds, thunder and lightning caused a break in play of 25 minutes before the action could resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It made for a memorable night, and one that ended with the host nation coming through a stern test of their credentials to keep alive their dream of winning the trophy in Berlin on July 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The path is set to get much tougher from here, however, and Julian Nagelsmann's team will now go to Stuttgart for a quarter-final next Friday against either much-fancied Spain or surprise package Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Denmark, who famously beat Germany in the 1992 European Championship final, go home without winning a game. (Reuters, AFP)

    Policeman wounded near Israeli embassy in Belgrade

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Serbian police officer on Saturday killed a man who shot him in the neck with a crossbow in front of the Israeli embassy in Belgrade, in what the prime minister called a "terrorist act".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police identified the assailant as being a "convert" to Islam, who was born in 1999 in the town of Mladenovac, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack happened around 11:00 am (1700 HKT) on Saturday in the Serbian capital, when the attacker shot the officer who was on duty outside the Israeli embassy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policeman "used a weapon in self-defence and defeated the attacker, who died as a result of his injuries", said Interior Minister Ivica Dacic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said some arrests had been made and a number of people known to the security services were suspected of being linked to the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said they were carring out searches in a number of locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer, who underwent surgery in hospital, was in his guard booth when the attack happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to authorities, the assailant had moved to live in Novi Pazar, which is a historical and political centre of the Bosniak Muslim minority in Serbia, and a centre of Islam in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dacic told reporters that there were early indications connecting the attack with people suspected of being linked to the Wahhabi movement -- an ultra-conservative branch of Islam that dominates in Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said several people had been arrested for "prevention reasons" and that overall security had been stepped up in Belgrade. Special prosecutors had taken over the case, added Dacic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic strongly condemned what he labelled a "heinous terrorist act".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an act of insanity, which cannot be attributed to any religion and any nation. It is a crime of an individual," he said, according to quotes from the Beta news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said his country would firmly respond to the threat of terrorism and stressed Serbian citizens could "feel safe".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli foreign ministry called it an "attempted terrorist attack in the vicinity" of the country's embassy in Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The embassy is closed and no employee of the embassy was injured", it said in a statement, saying the circumstances are still being investigated. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen continued his imperious form in Red Bull's homeland on Saturday when, after winning the sprint race, he claimed a convincing pole position for Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The series leader and three-time world champion clocked a best lap in 1 minute 4.314 seconds to outpace nearest rival Lando Norris of McLaren by 0.404sec for his fourth Austrian pole at the Red Bull Ring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also ended a run of three races where he was beaten in qualifying in Monaco, Canada and Spain and brought him his 40th career pole position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That went really well," said Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to adjust things a bit after this morning and it went well. It was warmer than yesterday and a bit tricky but the car felt good and I could attack the corners much more. It felt on point and really good out there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a while since we've been on pole and we have worked hard to be more competitive.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris said: "I think that was the best we could do today and Max was in a league of his own - but I am happy and I'll take that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George Russell took third for Mercedes ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes, Charles Leclerc in his Ferrari and Oscar Piastri in the second McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piastri's best flying lap was deleted for exceeding track limits in the closing minutes when he briefly went third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sergio Perez was eighth in the second Red Bull, continuing his struggles, ahead of Haas's Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Ocon of Alpine. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Saturday said it strongly disapproves of remarks by the US regarding the human rights situation in the city. This came after the US published its 2023 Report on International Religious Freedom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the US report was another attempt to slander the SAR under the guise of religious freedom. It accused the US of piling up false stories and fabricating narratives. It said residents of Hong Kong enjoy the right of religious freedom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also called on the US to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.

 Tuen Mun Magistrates' Court on Saturday ordered a psychiatric assessment of a man, who allegedly tried to kill his wife and three daughters by burning charcoal at a public housing flat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 43-year-old faces four counts of attempted murder. He allegedly lit the charcoal before fleeing the flat on Shan King Estate in Tuen Mun on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Principal Magistrate Daniel Tang adjourned the case to July 12, pending psychiatric reports to determine whether the man is fit to enter a plea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was remanded in custody.

    Security chief says being a fugitive has a high cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security Chris Tang on Saturday said that the government revoked the passports of six wanted people this month to send a message that there was a high cost to being a fugitive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an interview to mark the second anniversary of the current administration, Tang said fugitives might also lose any foreign travel documents once they were no longer of use to those harbouring them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know why these people think that, 'maybe I'll still have the opportunity to travel to other places by using my refugee status as a refugee or another status.' I'm not entirely sure in this regard," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But firstly, you'll not be able to use Hong Kong SAR passports to travel; and secondly, while you may now have value because others sympathise with you - and they have granted you travel documents - you might lose those documents, when you no longer have any value. Then you won't be able to travel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six people wanted here for alleged national security offences under homegrown national security legislation include Nathan Law, Mung Siu-tat, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng, Johnny Fok and Tony Choi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the security minister also called on Alman Chan, the wanted principal of drug rehabilitation centre Christian Zheng Sheng College, to return to Hong Kong from the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others - including Chan, who denies the allegations - were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that Alman Chan said on social media that 'Oh I did not take any funds from the college and the issue has nothing to do with me, and I'm not involved'.."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this is true, I hope he has the courage to return to Hong Kong and explain to us clearly about the whole matter. On the one hand you are running away, and on the other you are making such remarks. This has no meaning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Tang said authorities would make sure that the July 1 celebrations pass off peacefully.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on why there are now fewer protests on July 1, Tang said that, although protesting is allowed, a protest might be hijacked by people with ulterior motives so residents are choosing other options instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe Hongkongers, after going through what happened in 2019, they clearly know that - while they want to hold a peaceful protest - many people, who wish to endanger national security or Hong Kong's security, might take the opportunity to conduct acts endangering national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said Hong Kong residents know that they might be used, so they have chosen other ways to express their opinions. He also said residents might just feel the government is doing a good job.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong would grasp opportunities to innovate and transform the economy. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759582_2_20240629151414.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said that the city's 'One Country, Two Systems' governing principle is a world-recognised success, and that local residents know clearly that there's no change in the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng was speaking at a celebratory event in Victoria Park ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 27 years, which areas in Hong Kong have changed and which have not? While outsiders can pretend not to know, local residents clearly know that there's no change to the city's governing principle," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can clearly see that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle has not changed. The city's high degree of autonomy has not changed, its legal environment has not changed, the business environment has not changed, democracy and freedom have not changed, the way people live their lives has not changed, the city's international character has not changed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And at the same time, we can see all the positive changes in the city since the return to the Motherland. Hong Kong has moved from colonial rule to being the 'apple of the country's eye'," he added, hinting that more policies benefiting the SAR will come along the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also speaking at the event, Chief Executive John Lee again noted that Hong Kong will go all out to boost the economy, in spite of challenges that the SAR might face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is now undergoing economic transformation and it will face different new challenges. But Hong Kong people have always been able to adapt," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So as long as we grasp new opportunities, innovate for change, and strive to be stronger in our various posts... we'll surely reach more glorious achievements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's top leader also reviewed his work over the past two years via a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, the rolling out of light public housing, efforts to shorten the waiting time for the public housing, the removal of the property cooling measures, as well as the hosting of events to spur economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described his administration as a boat navigating the winds and tides, adding that many policies are gradually bearing fruit.

    Retail sector moves to cater for new allowances

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association says that the increased allowances will offer a boost to the retail industry. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759565_1_20240629121734.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse, said on Saturday that the industry will aim to offer more products that cater for the new duty-free shopping allowances announced by Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland shoppers heading back to the mainland will see their allowances more than double to 12,000 yuan from 5,000 yuan when returning from Hong Kong and Macau at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau Tse said that while the increased allowances did not match the annual 100,000 yuan duty-free shopping allowances in the mainland province of Hainan, it's hard to compare the two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [duty-free] system in Hainan island is really different from that in Hong Kong. There are different supporting systems for Hainan to achieve such [a quota], as it has real-name systems to keep track of how many things a customer buys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, the duty-free sales in Hainan are monopolised by one group. In other words, it is much simpler to manage a system within one single group, whereas in Hong Kong, we have so many retailers, all of which are duty-free. So how can we set up one system with them all together? It is challenging..."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Tommy Cheung said that the increase was a gift from Beijing ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also urged the government to keep lobbying for allowance increases and an expansion of the multiple-entry limits for mainland visitors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board, Ng Yut-ming, has resigned amid a government plan to reform the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the board's website, Ng's tenure in office ended on Friday, following the earlier departure of six other members: Toby Ho, Grace Wong, Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means only one elected member, Oscar Lai, remains on the board. The three-year term for the current board is set to expire in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to start the second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the body next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.

    Brazil up their game to beat Paraguay 4-1

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brazil forward Vinicius Junior anticipates the ball during the second half. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759569_1_20240629130036.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazil's Vinicius Jr scored twice in his side's 4-1 Copa America victory over Paraguay in a Group D clash in Nevada on Friday, bouncing back from a lacklustre display in his first game of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Colombia, who have qualified for the quarter-finals, top Group D with six points after two matches, with Brazil in second on four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costa Rica are third with one point and Paraguay, who are bottom with zero after two defeats, have been eliminated from the competition in the group stage for only the second time since 2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This victory marked Brazil's first win in six competitive matches and their maiden competitive win under the management of Dorival Jr, who took charge of the team in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the whistle, Vinicius' pace and trickery posed a constant threat to Paraguay down the left flank, a far cry from his performance in Brazil's 0-0 draw with Costa Rica in their opening group stage match, in which he was largely ineffectual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Brazil's strong start, it was Paraguay who almost went ahead in the 15th minute as Damian Bobadilla's goal-bound effort took a massive deflection off Eder Militao and nearly wrongfooted Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who showed quick reflexes to keep out the strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil earned a 28th-minute penalty for a handball, which was fired wide by Lucas Paqueta, but the midfielder made up for his miss seven minutes later as he set up Vinicius with a first-time pass to cap off a flowing team move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girona winger Savio doubled Brazil's advantage after pouncing on a rebound inside the box, before Vinicius stuck out a boot to divert a clearance from Omar Alderete into the net for his second goal of the night in first half stoppage time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paraguay got a goal back after the break as Alderete netted a superb long-range, but any hopes of a comeback were swiftly dashed when Brazil were awarded a penalty in the 68th minute after a handball by Mathias Villasanti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his earlier miss, Paqueta stepped up and made no mistake at the second time of asking to send Brazil's fans at the Allegiant Stadium into delirium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Towards the end of the match, tempers flared and Andres Cubas was shown a red card after kicking out at Douglas Luiz, with Brazil using their man's advantage to comfortably see out the game and clinch the three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In particular the first half, up to the 40 minutes, it was very even," Paraguay coach Daniel Garnero told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we created some opportunities. Unfortunately, in the three minutes we got a bit distracted and they scored two goals that made a great difference in the result. And Vinicius is an elite player, no doubt about it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil next face group leaders Colombia in California on Tuesday, where a draw would be enough to secure qualification for the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paraguay face Costa Rica, who retain a slim chance of progressing to the quarter-finals, in Texas. (Reuters)
