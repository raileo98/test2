<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced Palestinians killed 93 people, as Israel's military accused militants of using the building as a command centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas denounced the "dangerous escalation" in north Gaza, which came after international mediators invited the warring sides to resume next Thursday talks towards a long-sought ceasefire and hostage-release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry said the timing of the school strike "is an indication of the Israeli government's efforts to obstruct and thwart these efforts".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence in the Hamas-ruled territory said three Israeli missiles hit the school in Gaza City while people performed dawn prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their bodies were torn apart," civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. "It reminds us of the first days of the war in the Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced during the war started by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings, which have been hit at least 14 times since July 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army said on Saturday it had "precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the Al-Tabieen school".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has repeatedly made similar accusations after strikes on the school shelters. Hamas has previously denied Israeli claims that it uses schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities for military aims. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded more than 45,300 crimes during the first half of the year, a 5.6 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deception made up about 40 percent of all cases. Victims – who were mostly scammed online – were swindled out of HK$4.48 billion in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the number of "Guess Who" phone scams were down by 61 percent, the force pointed out that fraudsters had adopted new tactics such as impersonating staff of e-shopping and online payment platforms, and telecommunications companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force also revealed that its robbery detection rate of 84.1 percent was the highest since it started maintaining statistics for the period in 1977, with police stepping up anti-burglary patrols, especially in areas with village houses. Officers noted they used drones and partnered with the Government Flying Service to carry out air patrols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of June 30 this year, 300 arrests have been made under the National Security Law that was put in place four years ago, it added. About 60 percent of those arrested have been charged.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 1,000 policymakers, researchers and young entrepreneurs gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre on Saturday for the city's first youth development summit, organised by the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee said young people should learn from the Olympic spirit and be inspired by Hong Kong's young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we can't all be Olympic champions, we can all be champions of our own stories. We can all live in the spirit of the Olympic motto, faster, higher, stronger, together, in our pursuit," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong also attended the summit, where she showed her medal from the Paris Games to audience members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, who won gold in the women's individual epee, said she was initially very nervous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time I was nervous, I would turn and channel all that energy into training. So the more nervous I got, the more training I did, and that gave me the confidence to be like: okay, I am doing everything I can to fence the best that I can at the Olympics and I shouldn't be scared, I shouldn't be worried about the results", the 30-year-old fencer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said that the government's youth development blueprint could provide all-round support to its targeted beneficiaries of those aged between 12 and 39.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blueprint was rolled out in December 2022, with around 60 additional measures added last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them includes the Member Self-recommendation Scheme for youth. The government is working to triple the number of participating advisory committees to not less than 180 in the current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To date, 85 government advisory committees have joined the scheme, covering trade and industry, innovation and technology, human resources planning, child affairs, and much more," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that the energy, creativity, and resilience of young people will help create a better future.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong paediatrician on Saturday said the SAR has seen a large rise in scarlet fever cases this year, and he advised early treatment with antibiotics to prevent complications. The disease, which is caused by streptococcal infection, usually affects children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan, from the university's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said symptoms include high fever and a red body rash that leaves an in-print if touched. Speaking on a radio programme, he gave more details about the rise in case numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, for example last year, the notification rate in fact is less than 10 every month. But in Hong Kong this year, the notification rate, up until last month was around 260 in June. So the number is really high, and this indicated the streptococcal strep A activity is really high among our population," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lau Yu-lung, chairman of the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases, said there had been 4,500 Covid cases in Hong Kong last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the 31st week of this year - between July 28 and August 3 - sewage surveillance showed that infections seemed to have reached their peak. But it's too early to say whether there has been any decline," he said, while appearing on the same radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lau said there had been seven outbreaks in care homes last week involving 60 patients, and the situation is worrying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Covid jab could significantly lower the mortality rate, and he urged vulnerable people, such as those suffering from chronic illnesses, as well as people in care homes to get a booster.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said athletes have skills that are highly sought by employers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Saturday said businesses should be more open to employing athletes once they retire, as they have already shown their abilities on a global stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Mr Yeung said the government had allocated resources to help athletes once they step down. He said most have skills that are highly sought by employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually we hope the business sector will consider employing more athletes because we think they have a lot of abilities: such as how they face challenges, how they remain calm under pressure, and their perseverance. These are qualities we hope society will be able to see, and we hope the business sector will be able to give athletes more chances," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said universities here have been admitting athletes through their top athletes admission scheme and granting them a longer study period so they can attend training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the promotion of sport in the community is crucial if new talent is to be discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government is trying to promote different kinds of sport in the community.... When more people are involved in sport, more people will develop an interest in sport, and it will be easier for us to find talent and give them the resources to train their skills," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are also supporting the Hong Kong Sports Institute and The Jockey Club to do research into how to increase athletic performances and make use of human science to improve training," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the Paris Games had encouraged people to go out in the evening and watch Olympic events, which are free-to-air. He said the catering industry had recorded around a 30 percent increase in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked whether the government would continue to purchase the Olympic Games broadcasting rights in future, Yeung said the government would consider sporting events on a case-by-case basis.

    PBOC to increase buying and selling of treasury bonds

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's central bank, The People's Bank of China, said it would pay attention to changes in long-term bond yields. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765596_1_20240810084940.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's central bank will seek to "enrich" its monetary policy toolbox and will gradually increase buying and selling of treasury bonds in its open market operations, its second-quarter monetary policy implementation report said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will also seek to steadily lower companies' financing and household credit costs, the report said, adding that prudent monetary policy should be "flexible, moderate, precise and effective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC will "guide credit to grow reasonably and balance the supply of credit while keeping liquidity reasonably ample," said the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank will pay attention to changes in long-term bond yields during economic recovery and said it will conduct stress tests on the risk exposures of bond assets held by financial institutions and prevent interest rate risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's necessary to enrich the monetary policy toolbox, enrich and improve methods of monetary base injection, and gradually increase buying and selling of government bonds in the central bank's open market operations," the PBOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank will pay close attention to changes in the monetary policies of major overseas central banks, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economic growth missed forecasts in the second quarter, depressed by a property downturn and sluggish domestic demand, while some July economic indicators showed a mixed and unbalanced recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC will also study plans to appropriately narrow its interest rate corridor and deliver clearer signals of interest rates adjustments to markets. The central bank last month launched temporary repo or reverse repos to make open market operations more efficient and keep the banking system liquidity ample.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the Chinese yuan, the PBOC vowed it will prevent the formation and self-reinforcement of unilateral expectations and will guard against risk of exchange rate overshooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yuan is up 0.7 percent against the dollar this month, in tandem with a surging Japanese yen, as an unwinding of short positions snowballed following a surprise rate hike by the Bank of Japan and weakness in US economic indicators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To achieve a stable and sound development of the property sector, the PBOC said it will step up support to construction and seek to boost supplies of affordable housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keeping prices stable and ensuring moderate inflation will still be a significant consideration of the bank's monetary policy, the bank said, adding it will keep prices at a "reasonable level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's consumer prices rose at a slightly faster-than-expected rate in July, partly due to weather disruptions in food supplies, while producer deflation persisted, official data showed on Friday. (Reuters)

    Regional plane crashes in Brazil killing 61

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The plane crashed in the town of Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765594_1_20240810084017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A regional turboprop plane crashed near Sao Paulo in Brazil on Friday, killing all 61 people on board, the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Regional carrier Voepass said the plane, bound for Sao Paulo's international airport, took off from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed at around 1.30 pm in the town of Vinhedo, some 80 km northwest of Sao Paulo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video shared on social media showed the ATR-72 aircraft spinning out of control as it plunged down behind a cluster of trees near houses, followed by a large plume of black smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearby resident Daniel de Lima said he heard a loud noise before looking outside his condominium in Vinhedo when he saw the plane in a horizontal spiral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was rotating, but it wasn't moving forward," he told Reuters. "Soon after it fell out of the sky and exploded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City officials at Valinhos, near Vinhedo, said there were no survivors and only one home in the local condominium complex had been damaged while none of the residents were hurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I almost believe the pilot tried to avoid a nearby neighbourhood, which is densely populated," de Lima said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not immediately say what had caused the crash, though the head of Brazilian aviation accident investigation centre Cenipa said that the plane's so-called "black box" containing voice recordings and flight data had been recovered from the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video of the crash showed clear weather, with the forecast for the area calling for light rainfall and winds of 10 km per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may have been an engine failure on one side that was mismanaged by the crew," he said. "It could be the thrust of the remaining engine that started the rotation downward."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US aviation safety consultant and former commercial pilot John Cox said he would want to validate the Flightradar data, which showed a lot of gyrations in speed, but regardless, something "really significant" happened to cause the plane to spin when it came down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't spin airliners," Cox said. "So that says at some point it stalled and then the flight crew lost control of it. But it appears that there may have been some catastrophic event before that loss of control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cenipa head Marcelo Moreno cautioned in a press conference that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From what we can tell so far, the aircraft did not reach out to traffic control reporting an emergency," Moreno said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voepass, Brazil's fourth-largest airline by market share, said it could not provide any additional information on what caused the plane to crash. It had originally reported 62 people aboard the aircraft, though local media interviewed a man who said he had missed the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, the plane was carrying 57 passengers and four crew, Voepass said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Franco-Italian ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Leonardo, is the dominant producer of regional turboprop planes seating 40 to 70 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ATR told Reuters that its specialists were "fully engaged" with the investigation into the crash and its customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The motor on the plane was a PW 127 produced by Pratt & Whitney Canada, its parent company RTX Corp confirmed to Reuters. RTX said that it had offered assistance in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both French and Canadian investigators will participate in the investigation, Moreno said. Europe's safety regulator also said it would offer technical assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash is Brazil's deadliest since 199 people were killed in 2007 on a flight operated by TAM, which later joined LAN to become what is now LATAM Airlines. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The road to the Olympics is not easy for athletes, but it’s just as hard for judges who likely spend the same amount of time and effort in training to be able to officiate Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For gymnastics judge Yuen Ka-keung, the journey to Paris was lonely and arduous, but one that he hopes will pave the way for others to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Being an Olympic gymnastics judge is not easy because you have to pass many of the selection [tests] under the International Federation, so you had to prepare a lot, meaning that you had to spend a lot of the time and also you had to manage everything well,” Yuen, who is judging the Olympics for the third time in Paris, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to allocate my time and also allocate, for example, money to make the proper preparation for this Olympic Games. Another thing is that if you prepare for the Olympic Games very seriously, you will feel alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen is the only gymnastics judge from the SAR. To qualify, he had to judge designated events within the Olympics cycle and obtain the best evaluation result in two competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The veteran gymnast said he hopes the government will put more resources into training athletes, and those behind the scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gymnastics is not only [about the] coach and gymnast. We should have many more supporting people, for example the judge, the physiotherapist, the psychologist and other people,” Yuen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Wong, one of the two cycling judges from Hong Kong appointed by the International Federation, echoed Yuen’s views.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Hong Kong, we can organise different kinds or different levels of judge development or training courses and encourage the people to have the qualification to enter the international training courses," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like me, when I prepared for the international commissaire course, I paid [for it] myself,  [so I could] visit different kinds of large-scale events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, who played a leading role on the judging team for cycling at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said he feels proud to be a part of the world's biggest sporting event for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that safety is paramount on the racetrack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We stand on the track to monitor the behaviour of the riders and also the behaviour of different TV broadcast staff members. Because we need to protect all the people on the track,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case any accident happens, the riders will go out of the track with the bike and at that moment [there will be] a serious accident if we don't manage it in a proper way.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that he hopes newcomers can have more exposure to large-scale cycling events in Asia before they become judges.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Day 14 in Paris saw China mine gold in diving, sprint canoeing, table tennis and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gold rush sees China in second place in the medals table with 33 golds, behind the United States which also has 33 golds, but is in first place due to a higher overall medal count.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look at some of the key moments.

   After three Olympics without any gold medals in women's boxing, China won their second in as many days when Wu Yu beat Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu in the flyweight final on Day 14.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Wu's compatriot Yang Liu could not get past Algeria's Imane Khelif who claimed the gold medal in the women's welterweight boxing category at the Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khelif had been in the spotlight at the Paris Games amid a gender dispute that dominated headlines.

    Chen Yiwen added the women's 3m springboard gold to her synchronised title in the French capital, winning the seventh gold for the Chinese diving team at the Paris Olympics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chen's teammate Chang Yani finished third while Australian diver Maddison Keeney won the silver medal.

     China successfully defended their Olympic men's team title after beating Sweden in three nail-biting matches as Ma Long cemented his status as one of his country's most accomplished athletes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ma, already the most successful Olympic table tennis player, became the most decorated Olympian in China's history with six gold medals.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Although the national team overcame Sweden 3-0, each match was a five-game thriller as the seventh-seeded Swedes pushed them all the way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both Sweden and France celebrated their first ever medals in the table tennis team event, also marking the first time two European nations have stood on the podium.

       China came very close to winning an historic gold medal in women's field hockey, but in the end came up short against the Netherlands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Netherlands completed a remarkable double in Olympic hockey when their women's team, the defending champions, beat China 3-1 in a shootout to take gold just 24 hours after the men's side had triumphed over Germany.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Dutch women, who were appearing in their sixth successive final, were made to work hard for their fifth Olympic gold medal after China held them to a 1-1 draw in regulation time.

        Sha'Carri Richardson powered the US to an Olympic sprint relay gold with a storming anchor leg.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Richardson turned on the afterburners to overhaul Britain, Germany and France in the home straight as the US quartet took gold.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But on a wet track at the Stade de France, the US men again failed in their bid to win their first 4x100m gold since Sydney in 2000 with a disastrous baton fumble.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Already missing 100m individual champion Noah Lyles through Covid, a botched baton change completely slowed the US momentum, allowing Canada to snatch gold ahead of South Africa and Britain.

         Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time as Spain took gold in the Olympic men’s soccer final after a 5-3 win against France on Friday.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The thrilling win at Parc des Princes completed a golden summer for Spanish soccer — following the senior team's European Championship triumph last month.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         France came back from 3-1 down to send the game to extra time when Jean-Phillipe Mateta equalised from the penalty spot in the third minute of time added on.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         But substitute Camello coolly lifted over France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes in the 100th and got his second in the first minute of time added on.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The urban sport of breaking spun its way onto the Olympic stage on Friday for the first and possibly last time, with Japan's B-Girl Ami winning the inaugural women's gold.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Breaking, better known as breakdancing, made its debut amid the grand elegance of Paris' Place de la Concorde, with 17 dancers known as B-Girls going head-to-head in a series of battles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ami, whose name is Ami Yuasa, beat Lithuania's Dominika "Nicka" Banevic in the final, with China's Liu "671" Qingyi taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport's appearance at the Olympics could be a fleeting one however, having already been dropped from the Los Angeles 2028 programme and no guarantees it will return in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was disappointing it was decided that it wouldn't be in LA, particularly before we even had a chance to show it," said Australian B-Girl Rachel "Raygun" Gunn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that was possibly a little premature. I wonder if they're kicking themselves now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers ensured breaking made the most of its time in the spotlight in Paris, pumping up the volume for an excited crowd that included rapper Snoop Dogg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each battle sees B-Girls take turns to lay down their dance moves over a set number of rounds, with a panel of judges determining the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition opened with a pool stage featuring four groups of four B-Girls, before moving onto the knockout round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first contest of the day was between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, known by her B-Girl name India, and Refugee Olympic Team competitor Talash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talash, whose real name is Manizha Talash, left Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to live in Spain two years ago and danced wearing a blue cape with "Free Afghan Women" printed on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's competition takes place on Saturday. (AFP)

  Another spellbinding night of athletics action at the Stade de France saw the United States add to their gold medal tally thanks to a stunning last leg from sprint star Richardson in the women's 4x100m relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US's highly fancied men's relay quartet however finished empty-handed after a disastrous performance saw them disqualified, with Canada storming to a memorable victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's 10,000m, Kenya's Beatrice Chebet completed a long distance double with her second gold medal of the games, four days after triumphing in the 5,000m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a masterful performance from the diminutive East African known as the "smiling assassin", who timed her finish to perfection to scamper home in 30minutes 43.25 seconds, ahead of Italy's Nadia Battocletti (silver) and Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's shot put saw Germany's Yemisi Ogunleye snatch a dramatic gold medal with her final attempt, a last-ditch heave of 20.00m taking her past New Zealand's Maddison-Lee Wesche, who threw 19.86m. China's Song Jiayuan won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's triple jump, Spain's Jordan Diaz won gold with a jump of 17.86m, with Portugal's Pedro Pichardo taking silver and Andy Diaz of Italy claiming bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were golds too for the Dominican Republic's Mari Marileidy Paulino in the women's 400m, while the men's 400m hurdles saw the United States add to their gold tally with Rai Benjamin outfoxing Norway's Karsten Warholm to claim gold. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Controversial boxer Imane Khelif is officially queen of the ring, winning an Olympic gold medal amid a gender row which has cast a shadow over her Paris campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Algerian defeated China's Yang Liu by unanimous decision in the women's 66kg gold medal bout, with all three rounds going in her favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang, the reigning Asian Games champion, was unable to repel Khelif's fast and powerful punches, often retreating while failing to land good hits on her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was written on the wall even before the umpire made the announcement, with Khelif already holding one arm in the air looking ready to celebrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was consolation for China earlier on Friday night, after Wu Yu clinched gold in the women's 50kg by taking a 4-1 split decision over Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There was heartbreak for China's women's hockey team after they were beaten in the final by the Netherlands in a shootout, despite leading the defending champions most of the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was China's second silver medal in the sport, equalling their best-ever finish in Beijing in 2008 when they were also defeated by the Dutch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China nearly pulled off a remarkable upset after Chen Yi put the underdogs ahead just six minutes into the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands then laid siege in front of the Chinese goal, but couldn't find the equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finally broke down the stubborn defence nine minutes from time, when Yibbi Jansen found just enough space to fire home from a penalty corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides were unable to score again in regulation, and the match had to be decided by a shootout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anne Veenendaal put on a goalkeeping clinic, making three saves to deny China, and helping the Dutch claim their fifth women's crown in six Games.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street ended a volatile week higher. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765571_1_20240810042652.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended higher on Friday after a tumultuous week in which markets clawed their way back from Monday's steep dive that was prompted by fears of a recession and unwinding of a global yen-funded carry trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to end at 5,344, the Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.5 percent to 16,745. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 percent to 39,497.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology sector led gains in the index for the day, while the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's "fear gauge", was down on Friday after surging to 65.73 at the start of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Fed policymakers expressed confidence that inflation was cooling enough to allow interest-rate cuts ahead, and will take their cues on the size and timing of those cuts from the economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's big decline followed a sharp sell-off last week as a weaker-than-expected July jobs report sparked recession fears, and the Bank of Japan's decision to hike interest rates on July 31 led to a sharp appreciation in the yen. That resulted in the unwinding of currency carry trade positions in which the yen is used to buy high-yielding assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For most of the last week the negative opinions were driving sentiment and direction and those have been outweighed by a little less pessimism," in recent days, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he said, "there is going to continue to be a significant amount of uncertainty and anxiety hanging over the market for the course of the next month until we get to the next Fed meeting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors see a 55 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on September 17-18, with a 25 basis point cut seen as having a 45 percent probability, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors also await next week's readings on US consumer prices and retail sales for July, which could provide fresh evidence on the chances of a soft landing for the American economy. (Reuters)

    Beijing complains to WTO over EU tariff hike

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In recent years, China has emerged as a EV powerhouse. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765566_1_20240810032643.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Friday it had filed an appeal with the World Trade Organization over the European Union's imposition of additional tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In July, the EU slapped extra provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EVs after its executive arm concluded in an investigation that they were unfairly undermining European rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On August 9, China appealed to the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism over the EU's temporary anti-subsidy measures on EVs," a spokesperson for the country's commerce ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said the appeal aimed to "safeguard the development rights and interests of the electric vehicle industry and cooperation over the global green transformation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU's preliminary ruling lacks a factual and legal basis, seriously violates WTO rules, and undermines the overall situation of global cooperation in addressing climate change," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We urge the EU to immediately correct its wrong practices and jointly maintain the stability of China-EU economic and trade cooperation as well as EV industrial and supply chains."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels said it took note of Beijing's move but was "confident" its probe and provisional measures were WTO-compatible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU is carefully studying all the details of this request and will react to the Chinese authorities in due course according to the WTO procedures," a European Commission spokesperson told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Geneva, WTO spokesman Ismaila Dieng said the organization had received the Chinese request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further information will be made available once the request has been circulated to WTO members," Dieng added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Definitive duties are due to take effect by November for a five-year period, pending a vote by the EU's 27 states. (AFP)

 Substitute Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time to settle a remarkable Olympic men's football final on Friday as Spain beat France 5-3 to take gold after the hosts had earlier staged a dramatic comeback.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It had looked as though Spain were going to run away with victory at the Parc des Princes in Paris when they recovered from conceding an early goal to lead 3-1 by half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enzo Millot put France in front, but a Fermin Lopez brace and an Alex Baena free-kick turned the final completely on its head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, France staged a memorable comeback with Maghnes Akliouche pulling a goal back before Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a stoppage-time penalty awarded following a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That took the final into extra time, where Rayo Vallecano forward Camello emerged as the hero by giving Spain the lead again in the 100th minute of an absorbing game, and then running away to seal their victory at the death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Silver medallists in Tokyo three years ago, it is the second time Spain have won Olympic men's football gold after their victory in Barcelona in 1992 with a squad featuring Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France had hoped for a second gold of their own, 40 years after winning in Los Angeles, but instead have to settle for silver. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s men’s table tennis team of Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Fan Zhendong on Friday took gold at the Paris Olympics, beating the seventh seeded Swedish team 3-0.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This is the fifth straight gold medal for the men's team at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three matches between the teams went the distance and went on for more than two and a half hours at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the opening doubles match, Ma and Wang dropped the opening game against Swedish duo Anton Kallberg and Kristian Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the national team came back strong and won the next two games 11-4 and 11-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the fourth game to Sweden 6-11 and took the final game 11-7 to win the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan, who struck gold in the men’s singles in Paris, took on Sweden’s Truls Moregard in the second match. It went back and forth before Fan pulled through for a 3-2 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one paddler Wang started strong in the third match and won the first two games 11-9 and 11-5, before losing the next two to Sweden’s Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang beat Karlsson 11-2 in the fifth and decisive game, sealing gold for China.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Chen Yiwen triumphed in the women's 3m springboard final on Friday at the Paris Olympics, putting the national team one gold medal away from achieving all eight diving crowns at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chen, who is a first-time Olympian, performed five stellar dives leading the scoreboard throughout all five rounds. She earned a total of 376.00 to top the podium – over 30 points ahead of the silver medallist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old attempted a forward 3 ½ somersaults pike in the fourth round, making this her best dive and earning her a 77.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Chen’s second gold at these Games, where she also won the women’s synchronised 3m springboard with teammate Chang Yani.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia’s Maddison Keeney came in second, maintaining the silver spot throughout the competition with a score of 343.10. Her last forward 2 ½ somersaults 2 twists pike dive earned her a 78.20, the highest score received in the entire competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chang wasn’t able to replicate the success she had in the synchronised diving having had a rough start finishing at the end of the pack in round one, but she was able to catch up by the fourth round to secure the bronze with a 318.75.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men’s 10m platform final – the last diving event of the Games – begins on Saturday at 9pm Hong Kong time, where China is looking to complete a clean sweep of golds in all eight diving events.

 A study on one of the Hong Kong's beloved giant pandas could shed light on life-long care for the animals, according to researchers who had monitored the late An An.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park on Friday said it had conducted a study on the world's oldest zoo-housed male giant panda, covering the final two years of his life and tracking his activities, movement patterns, and habitat preferences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Results showed that An An, who lived 35 years or roughly 105 human years, conserved energy by favouring gentle slopes when going uphill and steeper paths when descending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said this behaviour – which led the animal to cover greater distances uphill than downhill – mirrored that of wild giant pandas, researchers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park's senior research fellow, Eszter Matrai, said the study will help improve future enclosure designs for ageing pandas and can also be considered for other animals at zoos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This provides an objective measure of lifestyle changes based on life stages in terms of age and illnesses. The results can be used for habitat optimisation and sustainable improvement for life-long care,” Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the study contributed to the limited literature on the behaviour of geriatric animals, because previous studies on ageing pandas had primarily focused on veterinary medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These findings go beyond design enhancements, guiding tailored care plans and enrichment activities based on age-related behavioural changes and seasonal variations," Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An An was one of two giant pandas gifted by the central government to Hong Kong in 1999. He died in July 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese pair of Xu Shixiao and Sun Mengya powered to victory in the women's canoe double 500 metre final at the Paris Games on Friday, setting a new Olympic record of 1:52.81 and breaking the mark of 1:53.73 that they set earlier in the day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Liudmyla Luzan and Anastasiia Rybachok came in second to take silver, with Canada's Sloan Mackenzie and Katie Vincent finishing third to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a tailwind providing some of the choppiest waters seen at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, Xu and Sun got off to an excellent start but the Canadians kept the pressure on them before fading over the final stretch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the national team's second canoe sprint medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's freestyle wrestler Zou Wanhao was not able to make a comeback in the men’s 57 kilogramme category at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old lost by a final score of 7-4 to Kyrgyzstan's Bekzat Almaz Uulu in the repechage, bringing his debut Olympic run to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uulu will next face Gulomjon Abdullaev of Uzbekistan in the bronze medal bout. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR is sending 23 athletes to Paris for the upcoming Paralympic Games, with prize rewards nearly doubled to reward Paralympians.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The athletes representing Hong Kong, China, are set to compete in eight sports. The squad includes wheelchair fencer Alison Yu, who will be competing at the Paralympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu, who has won seven Paralympic gold medals, three silvers and one bronze, said it is important to get into the right mindset in the last weeks leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so looking forward to competing at the Grand Palais... In the Olympic Games, we saw Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong get gold medals at the Grand Palais, so I think the Grand Palais is a lucky place for us," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to relax a bit from fencing, not thinking so much about fencing and trying to be ready mentally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For rider Natasha Tse, she said it is an honour to compete for the SAR in her fourth Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My challenges in this Games are on how to get used to my new horse, or how to get used to the weather, or even the accuracy in my test," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Paralympian Leung Chung-yan, who will compete in the men's table tennis singles, said he is excited to play and hopes to win a match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officiating at the flag ceremony ahead of the Games, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to higher rewards for Paralympians, with a gold medal winning solo athlete set to receive HK$1.5 million. He also said the entire city is behind the SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of you have overcome various challenges to reach the pinnacle of sport, competing with athletes from all over the world on the Paralympic stage. We are proud of you," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your participation not only represents your personal efforts and achievements but also represent Hong Kong's support and recognition of parasports."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Paralympics will run from August 28 to September 8.

    DAB urges government to tackle rat problem in Wan Chai

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Many Wan Chai shopkeepers and residents surveyed by the DAB said they encountered rodents on the streets. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765505_1_20240809165148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Thursday raised concerns about a rodent problem in the back alleys of Wan Chai and called for government intervention to tackle it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department shows that Wan Chai is the most infested of Hong Kong's 18 districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent DAB survey of over 800 shopkeepers and residents in the area, more than 70 percent said they had encountered rodents on the streets between May and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jennifer Chow, chairwoman of the party's Wan Chai branch, said the three main hotspots identified in the district were Bowrington Road Market, Yat Sin Street and Wing Hing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some residents saw rats climbing up the pipes into their homes and they were very frightened. We have to do more in terms of cleaning the environment to prevent the rats from going down the street," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hotspots are mostly the back lanes of the private property that is not the government area. So that's the most difficult thing that they face because they don't have any support from the government to clean or to prevent most of the rubbish in their back lane."

    Philippine court allows Rappler to keep operating

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maria Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, was a vocal critic of former president Rodrigo Duterte and the deadly drug war he launched. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765491_1_20240809154850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Philippine news site co-founded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa can continue operating after a court overturned a shutdown order, according to the ruling released on Friday, in the latest legal victory for the media outfit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ressa and Rappler have been fighting multiple court cases filed during former president Rodrigo Duterte's administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, was a vocal critic of Duterte and the deadly drug war he launched in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That triggered what media advocates say was a grinding series of criminal charges, probes and online attacks against her and Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeals decision, issued on July 23 but only released to the media on Friday, reversed a previous ruling by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had ordered the shutdown of Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC order had been a "grave abuse of discretion" and contravened "established procedures, jurisprudential and legal instructions, and clear intent of the Constitution", the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC shutdown order was issued on June 28, 2022, days before Duterte left office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It revoked Rappler's "certificate of incorporation" for violating constitutional and statutory restrictions on foreign ownership in mass media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rappler has continued operating as it appealed the SEC order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the constitution, investment in media is reserved for Filipinos or Filipino-controlled entities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case sprang from the 2015 investment from the US-based Omidyar Network, which was established by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Omidyar later transferred its investment in Rappler to the site's local managers to stave off efforts by Duterte to shut it down. (AFP)

 We've heard a lot over the past two weeks about athletes battling it out for the gold medal at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  What about ordinary people like you and I?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While our gold medal moments may not involve winning a place on the podium, we've all experienced things in life that made us incredibly happy or proud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK spoke to people in Paris and Hong Kong, and asked them what they felt were their proudest or most joyous moments.

    Discovery Bay ferry fares to rise from Sunday

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People travelling on the Discovery Bay ferry to and from Central will pay up to 21 percent more per trip from August 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Adult residents using Octopus Cards registered with the ferry operator will see the fare for the 25-minute journey go up from HK$33.5 to HK$38.2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares will increase to HK$24 for those aged 65 or above, and to HK$19.1 for full-time students under 26, as well as children under 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices for those without registered cards will go up from HK$46 to HK$55.8, with the discounted rate for seniors and children rising from HK$23 to HK$27.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase approved by the government is lower than the 60 percent the ferry operator, Discovery Bay Transportation Services, had requested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to Islands District Council, the Transport Department noted that the fares were last raised in June 2018. It said the number of passengers had dropped, while operating costs continued to rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The revenue generated by the ferry service has been insufficient to cover the rising operating costs. In addition, the cumulative inflation rate has reached double digits since the last fare adjustment," the department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In granting the fare hike, the authorities said they had taken in account a number of factors, such as operating costs, revenues and the level of public acceptance of the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department also said the ferry operator should continue to "explore feasible measures" to improve its financial situation.

    URA announces Ma Tau Wai Road redevelopment project

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Friday unveiled plans for a HK$1 billion redevelopment project in To Kwa Wan that will affect around 180 households and 20 shops.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blocks with even numbers between 324 and 354 Ma Tau Wai Road will be demolished. The buildings are three to nine storeys high and were constructed between 55 and 69 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA said the blocks, containing many subdivided flats, have been poorly maintained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New buildings up to 120 metres in height will be built, offering around 230 residential units, with the blocks linked to nearby open space and an underground shopping street leading to To Kwa Wan MTR Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michelle Tong, the URA’s general manager for acquisition and clearance, outlined the compensation available for the flat and shop owners and residents affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will offer acquisition consideration to the owners and the value will be based on the market value at the time when we issue the acquisition offer. We will ask surveyors appointed through ballot to assess the market value and the home purchase allowance value at the time before the offer was issued,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the tenants, we will check their eligibility and if they fulfil the eligibility then we will offer the ex-gratia allowance or the rehousing arrangement.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A freezing survey will commence on Friday, followed by a public consultation exercise from September 25 to October 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA said it expects the project to be completed by 2033 or 2034, assuming no appeals are filed against it.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Johnny Ng says Hong Kong's virtual banks still probably need a couple more years to turn a profit, if similar banks in the UK and Germany are an indicator, although the trend is in their favour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Virtual banks have been operating here since 2020 and a recent report released by the Monetary Authority shows the SAR's eight virtual banks are still in the red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 2.2 million people use these banks, but their deposits account for only 0.3 percent of total savings among all Hong Kong banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Ng says they are gaining ground, especially among the young, as they can offer attractive 1-year fixed rate deposits and other offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people are often unaware that they have the same deposit protection as traditional banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, the protection is the same for HK$500,000 deposit in the bank which is protected by insurance of all banks, including traditional banks and also the virtual banks," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So you can see the trend... people moving, especially young people, moving from the traditional bank to use the virtual banks. Also they provide a lot of attractions and promotion offers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng also said that, unlike traditional banks, virtual banks don't require a minimum deposit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's virtual banks are ZA Bank, WeLab Bank, Mox Bank, Ant Bank, Livi Bank, Ping An One Connect Bank, Airstar Bank, and Fusion Bank.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fans can now travel back in time to catch a glimpse of what the Paris Games were like a century ago, thanks to new AI-powered cloud tech that can bring historic moments back to life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alibaba Cloud, a partner of the International Olympic Committee, is supporting the Games through cloud computing and e-commerce platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris Tung, president of Alibaba Group’s strategic development, said the tech giant is using generative AI to restore videos and colourise moments from when the French capital last hosted the Olympics in 1924.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By doing that, we'll be able to represent the glorious moments of Olympic Games in the past and be able to come up with concepts and stories to spread Olympic spirit and culture,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tung said that cloud infrastructure has overtaken satellites as the primary source of television broadcasts for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It has been more than 50 years that we watched exciting Olympic games on TV through satellite,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For Paris 2024, this will be the first time that cloud-based broadcasting exceeds the volume of satellite-based [broadcasts]. So it's a great building block from game to game, from flame to flame that we're doing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba Cloud has also built a data management platform for all Olympic venues, which they use to monitor and analyse energy consumption and carbon emission data, in line with the organisers’ goal of making the Paris Games the greenest ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding privacy concerns, Tung said all visitors’ personal data will be removed after 24 hours, while audio clips and videos will only be kept for less than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, mainland EV maker Xpeng has decided to make its debut on the French market in Paris to make the most of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now you are with the Olympics, this is the most beautiful city in the world. That was the perfect platform to launch such a premium brand,” said Thomas Rodier, head of marketing and communication at Xpeng France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very invested in leading EV technology, but also autonomous driving technologies where we are [a] leader in China, and soon, I hope in Europe," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodier also said provisional EU duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EV imports will not affect Xpeng's business in France.

 The United States kept the dream alive with a stirring fourth quarter rally to tame feisty Serbia 95-91 and move into the Paris Olympics men's basketball gold medal final against France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trailing by double digits for much of the game and down 76-63 heading into the fourth quarter, the United States chances of a fifth consecutive gold were quickly dimming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then NBA stars LeBron James and Stephen Curry took charge, bringing a wide-eyed capacity crowd at the Bercy Arena to their feet with a furious fight back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Curry made nine three-pointers on his way to lead all scorers with 36 points, while James finished with a triple double of 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A turning point of the game came with more than seven minutes left in the final period, when Serbia's star center Nikola Jokic committed a foul on Anthony Davis when American forward Kevin Durant made a three pointer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foul meant the US maintained possession of the ball, and Devin Booker hit another triple on the ensuing possession to cut the deficit to five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Curry made a three pointer for an 87-86 lead with around two minutes to go for the Americans' first lead since the first quarter, as they hung on for the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US win delivered the final basketball fans wanted to see and is sure to be one of the Paris Olympics highlights, as the Americans take on an inspired France on Saturday, in what will be a hostile Bercy cauldron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolstered by an electric home crowd, a turbo-charged France won a 73-69 thriller over Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France was led by a 17-point effort from Guerschon Yabusele while Isaia Cordinier chipped in 16, none more important than two free throws with seven seconds to play to blunt a Germany fight back and seal victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the national team, this jersey brings to us that different energy that we can't find nowhere else," said Victor Wembanyama, the first Frenchman to be taken number one overall in the NBA draft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can see how intense we've been over the last two games. It's something that we all feel as patriots. We love our jersey. We love our country." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese boxer Chang Yuan dominated from the opening bell to land gold in the women's 54kg final at the Paris Olympics on Friday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old from Hebei province landed a series of blows on her opponent, Turkey's Hatice Akbas, to win a unanimous points victory from the judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang was ahead on four of the five cards after the first round, when Akbas showed occasional signs of danger, but took full control for the latter two three-minute sections, scoring ahead on every card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In truth, Chang had been tested more heavily in earlier rounds, including in a split decision victory over the North Korean, Pang Cholmi, in the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the national team's 29th gold of the Games and the first in boxing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Chinese fighter, Li Qian, made it to the women's 75kg final thanks to a victory by unanimous decision over Caitlin Parker of Australia in Friday's semi-final.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street bounced back, with all three major indices ending the session higher. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765409_1_20240809043424.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Thursday in Wall Street’s latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about the slowing economy .
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 jumped 119.81 points, or 2.3 percent, to 5,319.31, for its best day since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683.04 points, or 1.8 percent to 39,446.49, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 464.22 points, or 2.9 percent to 16,660.02.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A week ago worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims fuelled worries that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates at too high for too long. That sent markets reeling, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that hit the carry trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down about 9 percent from its all-time set last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the market’s swings look more like a “positioning-driven crash” caused by too many investors piling into similar trades and then exiting them together, rather than the start of a long-term downward market caused by a recession, according to strategists at BNP Paribas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say it looks more similar to the “flash crash” of 2010 than the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 recession caused by the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, markets have been quick to turn over the past week regardless of any long-term predictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Today’s jobless claims data may ease some of the concerns raised by last week’s soft jobs report,” said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But with inflation data due out next week and the stock market still working through its biggest pullback of the year, it’s unclear how much this will move the sentiment needle.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime, big US companies continue to turn in profit reports for the spring that are mostly better than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Big Tech stocks also rose to claw back some of their sharp losses from the last month. (AP)

    Apple says it's falling into line with new EU rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with new European digital laws by allowing third-party app stores. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765399_1_20240809022302.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday announced changes to its App Store after the European Union accused the iPhone maker of breaking the bloc's landmark new digital rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU said the App Store terms prevented app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative ways to pay, making Apple the first ever tech firm to face accusations of breaching a new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now Apple says there will be changes to comply with the DMA and address the findings of the European Commission, the EU's powerful antitrust regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels at the time said developers could only steer customers through a link in their app that redirected the user to a web page to conclude any contracts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regulators said Apple placed "several restrictions" meaning app developers could not communicate, promote offers and conclude contracts through the channel of their choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the autumn, Apple said developers in the EU "can communicate and promote offers for purchases" wherever they want, for example, via an alternative app marketplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in Thursday's announcement, Apple said the changes mean developers will have a new fee structure for customers linking out of an app for offers and content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For instance, developers will have to pay a five-percent fee on sales of digital goods and services made on any platforms within a year of a user first installing an app with the ability to link out to a different channel such as a website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the big tech firms modify their platforms in accordance with EU rules, they can avoid large penalties. The DMA demands the EU wrap up any probe within a year of its start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission told AFP it "will assess Apple's eventual changes to the compliance measures, also taking into account any feedback from the market, notably developers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges against Apple came after the commission launched investigations in March into Apple, Facebook owner Meta and Google under the DMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta also faced formal accusations of violating the DMA in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DMA gives big tech a list of what they can and can't do in business in a bid to increase competition in the digital sphere. For example, they must offer choice screens for web browsers and search engines to give users more options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law gives the EU the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five percent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Coalition for App Fairness, whose members include Swedish streaming giant Spotify and which has long called for Apple to open up its marketplace, dismissed the latest Apple announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the introduction of yet another confusing, arbitrary, and expensive fee structure, Apple continues to evade compliance and make the digital landscape in Europe more complicated for developers and more costly for consumers," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with the DMA by allowing third-party app stores. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem won the Olympic men's javelin title in Paris on Thursday, his country's first individual gold at a Summer Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadeem threw an Olympic record of 92.97 metres for victory, India's defending champion Neeraj Chopra taking silver with 89.45. Grenada's Anderson Peters claimed bronze with 88.54m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Arshad's remarkable victory, Pakistan had never won an individual gold medal at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of Pakistan's previous three gold medals came in hockey, with their team winning gold in 1960, 1968 and 1984.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to Thursday, only two Pakistan athletes had won individual medals of any colour – with a wrestling bronze in 1960 and a boxing bronze in 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the 1992 Barcelona Games, Pakistan has not won a medal of any kind. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Benjamin Thomas recovered from a late crash to win gold in a pulsating Olympic men's omnium race and send the home fans wild inside the National Velodrome on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former world champion Thomas won the scratch race, the first of the four events that make up the omnium, and scored heavily in the elimination race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As is usual with the multi-event omnium, the final points race would decide the gold and Thomas was involved in a fierce tussle with Portugal's world champion Iuri Leitao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just as Thomas got to the top of the leaderboard he lost control of his bike and slid down the track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He calmly checked himself over though and re-joined the race with holes in his skin suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the crowd roaring him on he managed to stay on the wheel of Leitao, who made a late dash for gold, and could begin celebrating as he rounded the last corner knowing he had an unassailable lead in the points standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium's Fabio van den Bossche completed the podium with bronze, just ahead of Spain's fast-finishing Albert Torres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leitao became the first Portuguese to win an Olympic medal in track cycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, New Zealand's Ellesse Andrews surged to gold in the Olympic track cycling women's keirin. The 24-year-old hit the front early, held off Britain's Emma Finucane around the final bend and powered across the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finucane, who won gold in the team sprint, faded in the final metres and was overtaken by Dutch rider Hetty van de Wouw who took the silver with Finucane settling for bronze. (Reuters)

    FTX ordered to pay customers almost US$13bn

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US court has ordered bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX to pay US$12.7 billion in relief to its customers, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTX drew customers in with "an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets," then misappropriated their customer deposits to make its own risky investments, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The repayment order implements a settlement between the CFTC and the bankrupt crypto exchange, which has committed to a bankruptcy liquidation that will repay customers whose deposits were locked during its late 2022 collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has said its customers will receive 100 percent recovery on their claims against the company, based on the value of their accounts at the time it filed for bankruptcy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC agreement resolves a potential roadblock to that repayment, ensuring that the government's lawsuit against FTX will not reduce the funds available to its customers. The CFTC agreed not to collect any payment from FTX until all its customers are repaid, with interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC settlement requires FTX to pay US$8.7 billion in restitution and US$4 billion in disgorgement, which will be used to further compensate victims for losses suffered during the exchange's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for stealing US$8 billion from customers. He has appealed the conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has used its bankruptcy to reach settlements with US regulators and former business partners and to sell assets that had been purchased with misappropriated customer funds, including real estate and investments in crypto and other tech companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX is currently soliciting votes on its bankruptcy proposal but faces opposition from some customers who feel short-changed by the decision to repay them based on much-lower cryptocurrency prices from November 2022. Votes are due on August 16, and FTX intends to seek final approval of its wind-down plan on October 7. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Letsile Tebogo became the first African to win the Olympic 200 metres title on Thursday when he powered clear of American duo Kenny Bednarek and Noah Lyles in 19.46 seconds to claim Botswana's first Olympic gold medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tebogo, who won bronze at the worlds last year and set a national record of 9.86 when finishing sixth in the Paris 100m final, produced a dominant run to become the fifth-fastest man in history over 200m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bednarek chased him all the way to take a second successive silver in 19.62 seconds, with Lyles, hoping to become the first American to complete the sprint double since Carl Lewis 40 years ago, third in 19.67.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Immediately after the race, US officials said Lyles had Covid and a yellow card appeared against his name in the official results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minutes later, American Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone obliterated her own 400 metres hurdles world record with a time of 50.37 seconds to retain her Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anna Cockrell of the United States took silver and Dutchwoman Femke Bol claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her previous mark of 50.65 set at the US trials in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the sixth time she had broken the record and the crowd at the Stade de France went into a frenzy when it became clear a new all-time best was within her reach.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 19-year-old Islamic State sympathiser planned a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, the country's intelligence agency said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Austrian authorities detained two suspects on Wednesday for allegedly plotting to attack one of three Vienna concerts by the US star due to start Thursday. All were cancelled at the last minute leaving disconsolate "Swifties" to gather in the Austrian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old main suspect had confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives," domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner told a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert, either today or tomorrow," he added. The concerts were to run from Thursday to Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian, was employed at a facility management company which would have "provided services" at the Ernst Happel Stadium where Swift was to perform, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The younger suspect, who has so far refused to talk to authorities, was "in the area" of the stadium when he was detained, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chancellor Karl Nehammer said there were "concrete and detailed" plans to commit a "blood bath".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner, a "tragedy was averted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation was very serious", he added, particularly in view of a recent attack at a Taylor Swift themed event in Britain, where three girls were killed in Great Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explosives and detonators were found in a search of the main suspect's apartment, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria's top security chief Franz Ruf told reporters the two suspects had recently made changes in their private lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main suspect, an Austrian with Northern Macedonian roots, had changed "his appearance and adapted it to Islamic State propaganda", while the second, an Austrian of Turkish or Croatian origin, had broken up with his girlfriend, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruf earlier confirmed that authorities had received information "from foreign partners" which led to the arrests, but he declined to specify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had promised to ramp up security for the concerts while having minimised any concrete danger, but organisers still cancelled Swift's shows. About 65,000 people were expected at each show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's fans gathered in parks and plazas across Vienna to share their disappointment. Dilyara Joldassova, a 23-year-old engineer who travelled from Kazakhstan for the show, said she was "broken-hearted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift did not immediately comment on the decision to cancel the Vienna shows but after the British attack said she was "completely in shock".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three girls were killed and five people seriously wounded in the mass stabbing at a dance class in Southport inspired by the American singer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Ruf, police "did everything humanly possible to ensure" that the Vienna concerts "could go ahead", but the cancellation decision was taken by the organisers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old star was to bring her record-breaking "Eras" Tour, which began its European leg in Paris in May, to Vienna on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following France, the tour stopped in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of last year, "Eras" had already become the first tour to sell more than US$1 billion in tickets and it's on track to more than double that by the time it concludes in Vancouver in December. (AFP)

    HK's Lo Wai-fung misses out in Taekwondo repechage
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lo Wai-fung attempts a kick in his defeat to Liang Yushuai. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765396_1_20240809020655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China’s Lo Wai-fung wasn’t able to make a comeback in the men’s Taekwondo 68kg category, losing to national team athlete Liang Yushuai in the repechage at the Paris Olympic Games early on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two came in strong in the first round, but after a close battle, Liang came out on top in a close 5-4 contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unfortunately, Lo wasn’t able to take back control in the decisive second round, with Liang winning 13-0, care of two body kicks, a head kick and a five-point turning kick, bringing the SAR athlete’s Olympic debut to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said he was both nervous and excited in his bouts: nervous because it was such a big, raucous crowd at the Grand Palais, and excited because he wanted to enjoy the stage at his Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the first round [against Liang], I think I fought according to the coaches' plans," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But when it's the second round, perhaps my opponent disrupted my rhythm, and I got a bit anxious towards the end, so that allowed him to have a turning kick to the back of my head to extend his lead."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added he hopes he can inspire more taekwando fighters from the SAR to make it to the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo was previously defeated by reigning Olympic champion Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. Since the Uzbek athlete went on to make it to the final, Lo was granted entry to the repechage competition for a chance at bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, this is the first time a Hong Kong athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liang took bronze for China after his British opponent withdrew.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new Banksy artwork depicting a wolf on a satellite dish in London was removed, possibly stolen, less than an hour after it was unveiled by the elusive street artist on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The piece was the fourth animal-themed artwork that Banksy had installed in various parts of the UK capital this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The street artist, whose identity is unknown and the subject of feverish speculation, confirmed on Instagram that the works were his own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wolf silhouette was located on the roof of an empty shop in Peckham, southeast London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photos from the scene carried by local media show a person climbing up a ladder to retrieve the satellite dish while another holds the ladder for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further images show an individual in shorts walking off with the piece of art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were called to reports of a stolen satellite dish containing artwork at 1:52 pm (12:52 GMT) on Thursday, 8 August in Rye Lane, Peckham," London's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There have been no arrests. Inquiries continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, a Banksy of a goat precariously perched on top of a wall with rocks tumbling down appeared in Richmond, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then on Tuesday two elephant silhouettes with their trunks stretched towards each other appeared in Fulham, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the black silhouette of three monkeys appeared on the side of a railway bridge as if they were swinging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several months usually pass between new Banksy artworks and this week's sudden spurt has sparked speculation among fans about their meaning. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's weightlifter Luo Shifang set three new Olympic records as she claimed gold in the women's 59kg category at the Paris Olympics on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luo, who's making her Olympic debut, lifted 107kg in the snatch and 134kg in the clean and jerk to go with a winning total of 241kg, all new highs at the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old's total in Paris was 7kg short of her own world record, set in Thailand in April this year at the weightlifting World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada's Maude Charron took home silver with 236kg, and the champion of the Tokyo Games, Chinese Taipei's Kuo Hsing-Chun, snatched bronze with 235kg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the third weightlifting gold for the national team in two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, China's Shi Zhiyong was unable to complete his dream of winning his third gold in as many Olympics, after not being able to complete a lift in all three of his clean and jerk attempts in the men's 73kg category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had built himself a 10kg lead on the field after the snatch, having lifted 165kg in his second attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia's Rizki Juniansyah, who lifted an Olympic record of 199kg in clean and jerk for a total of 354kg, took his country's first gold medal in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand's Weeraphon Wichuma got silver Bulgaria's Bozhidar Andreev won bronze. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Xie Siyi on Thursday successfully defended his diving crown in men's 3m springboard at the Paris Olympics, with teammate Wang Zongyuan taking silver.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The result means the national team has now sealed six diving golds in its quest for a clean sweep in Paris, with just two more left to contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two teammates went neck and neck from the start, with only several points separating them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his last of six dives, Xie finished with a 100.7 – the only dive in the final that scored more than 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It ensured that he finished atop the podium again in Paris, having done the same in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, for his part, made a mistake in the second to last dive, meaning he finished the competition with 530.2 points, 13.4 less than his compatriot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xie, who came out of a brief retirement to compete in Paris, said he was nervous during the first two rounds of the final, when he was trailing Wang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the third round, I told myself: I need to slow down. There are so many spectators today – in the previous round there weren't that many," he told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So with so many people around suddenly, I needed to enjoy the atmosphere, the cheers. They may be for other teams, but I took them as though they were for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mexico's Osmar Olvera Ibarra grabbed bronze with just a little over 500 points.

 Radio Television Hong Kong has won an Asia-Pacific broadcasting award.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare secretary Chris Sun on Thursday said the elderly can showcase their talents through performing arts, as Hong Kong prepares to host its first festival to celebrate elderly artists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came as more than 100 performers aged up to 86 are set to take the stage at the "First Hong Kong Creative Ageing Arts Festival" next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also noted that Hong Kong's population is ageing, and urged all sectors to join hands and create an elderly-friendly culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 20 years time, every one in three people in Hong Kong will be aged 65 or above. We need to encourage more elderly to actively participate in society," Sun told an event to promote the festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope our creative ageing artists can showcase their abilities and skills to the community," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will feature more than 30 programmes including dance performances and art exhibitions starting from September 25 to October 6 at the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Lo Wai-fung was unable to beat the reigning Olympic champion Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the men’s Taekwondo 68kg category at the Paris Olympic Games on Thursday, but will have a chance of a bronze medal care of the repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Rashitov started off strong, beating Lo 12-0 in the first round with a series of kicks and punches. The Uzbek continued his lead into the second round, and while the 17th seeded SAR athlete was able to earn two points for a body kick, Rashitov ultimately came out victorious with a 9-2 win to reach the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rashitov went on to make it to the final, granting Lo entry to the repechage competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo and Liang Yushuai of China, who lost to the Uzbek in the quarterfinals, will fight each other in a repechage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner of the matchup, scheduled for 1.30am on Friday Hong Kong time, will fight another bout for a bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo is making history as the first teakwondo athlete to represent Hong Kong in the games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 75 prisoners have graduated from the Correctional Services Department's Ethics College, receiving diplomas in education.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Among the graduates was Tong Ying-kit, the first person charged under the National Security Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the graduation ceremony on Thursday, Tong reflected on his past, saying that he had been influenced by radical comments, misinformation and the social atmosphere at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was grateful for the education opportunities given to him, and expressed his desire to make positive contributions to society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang, who attended the ceremony, congratulated the graduates and said he was proud of their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the role of the college in guiding them towards a more constructive path in life and instilling in them the importance of upholding ethical values.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the event, Tang praised the achievements of Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong and expressed regret that some people targeted and criticised her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kong is supportive of the government and she condemns violence. I think the stance should be encouraged, and everyone should embrace that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong won gold in the individual epee event at the Paris Olympic Games and is joining the Hong Kong Jockey Club as an assistant external affairs manager.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group on Thursday said the sale of illegal cigarettes is becoming a more serious problem in Hong Kong, with free trial packets even handed out in the streets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group warned that such cigarettes could be harmful to health, because it's not clear what ingredients they contain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui Yuen, a member of the group, said he now sees promotional teams handing out free trial packets of illegal cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I run into them once or twice in Kwun Tong every week, there are no regulations! Where is the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Convener of the group Joe Lo said these promotional squads also encourage people to keep in contact with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Smokers are also invited to join the Telegram group to receive more promotional advertisements and to keep in contact," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also warned against a plan by the government to ban fruit-flavoured cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said a recent survey it carried out involving 297 people who smoked fruit-flavoured cigarettes found that two thirds would try to find illicit products if a ban came into effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Lo Wai-fung is heading into the round of 16 in the men’s Taekwondo -68kg category at the Paris Olympic Games, after beating Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in straight sets at the Grand Palais on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo began the first round of the qualification contest with a clean 14-0 sweep, earning nine points in the first minute for three head kicks. He then got two points for a body kick, followed by a three-point head kick to end round one with less than 20 seconds to spare. A round ends automatically if one contestant is ahead by 12 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ghotany fought back with a two-point kick to the body at the start of the second round, but Lo came back strong, leading to an intense exchange of blows in the first 30 seconds. The SAR athlete was able to continue with strong kicks to the head to once again pull away by 12 points, and won 16-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will face Uzbekistan’s Ulugbek Rashitov next for a place in the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they had foiled an attempt to smuggle 12 kilogrammes of gold, estimated to be worth HK$7.5 million, from Hong Kong to Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said an X-ray scan at the airport revealed gold hidden in parts of ozone generators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they suspect smugglers were trying to evade taxes of HK$800,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the third haul of smuggled gold to be intercepted by the authorities this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Society for Community Organization (SoCo) on Thursday called on the government to improve support for caregivers after a mother and son were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It's understood that the 60-year-old man died from an accident in the flat, while the 82-year-old bedridden woman died from a lack of care.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Yuen, a community organiser with Soco, said there is a lack of effort to identify high-risk families and inadequate emergency and temporary care support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said many carers do not know where to access support services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen stressed the need for proactive measures to support carers, noting that some older people with chronic illnesses are themselves forced to care for those even more vulnerable than themselves.

    Thousands join protests against racism in UK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There were anti-racism rallies in English cities including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765272_1_20240808110122.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets in several English cities on Wednesday to oppose days of far-right violence that have had UK police on high alert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nightly riots -- during which mosques and migrant-related facilities have been attacked -- have erupted across towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland fuelled by a wave of misinformation surrounding the murder of three children on July 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on Wednesday evening, it was anti-racism and anti-fascist counter-protesters who were out in greater numbers, holding rallies in cities up and down England including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whose streets? Our streets!" chanted protesters at a few-thousand-strong gathering in Walthamstow, northeast London, where some held banners saying "Stop the far right".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the borough and we don't want these people on our streets... they don't represent us," Sara Tresilian, 58, told AFP, referring to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have to turn out (and) give that message... I think it's important that you show up for your friends and neighbours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Valentine, the Met Police's deputy assistant commissioner, thanked "communities for coming together across the capital and for showing community spirit this evening".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sheffield, activists chanted "Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here," as riot police looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Birmingham, hundreds of anti-racism protesters gathered outside a migrant support centre, while in Brighton, around 2,000 people took part in a peaceful demonstration, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some friction, however, as in the southern town of Aldershot, where the PA reported police had to intervene between anti-racism activists and a group of people shouting "Stop the boats" -- a reference to migrants who reach Britain by crossing the English Channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had put 6,000 specialist police on standby to deal with the approximately 100 demonstrations by far-right activists and counter-protesters that were advertised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper thanked "all the police officers working tonight to protect & support local communities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Courts have started to order jail terms for offenders tied to the unrest as authorities seek to head off new troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disorder, Britain's worst since the 2011 London riots, has seen almost 430 people arrested and at least 120 charged, and has led several countries to issue travel warnings for the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence broke out after three girls aged nine, seven and six were killed and five more children critically injured during a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, northwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  False rumours initially spread on social media saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. The suspect was later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales. UK media reported that his parents are from Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rioting that followed has seen demonstrators throw bricks and flares at police officers, burn cars, and attack mosques and at least two hotels that have been used for asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned anyone involved will face "the full force of the law", including those inciting violence online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer, a former chief state prosecutor, has pledged "substantive sentencing before the end of this week" for rioters, and his government has freed up an extra 500 prison places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scores of accused, including teenagers, have already appeared before judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a man was jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder and assaulting a police officer in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other men received sentences of 20 months and 30 months for participating in violence in Liverpool on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest," said prosecutor Jonathan Egan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the disorder on figures associated with the now-defunct English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.

  EDL founder Tommy Robinson has been accused by authorities of stoking tensions, and police in Cyprus, where he was reported to be on holiday, said on Wednesday they were ready to assist UK police if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Robinson later wrote on the X social media platform: "Lucky I'm not in Cyprus then".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK lawmakers have accused social media sites of fuelling the violence. Tech billionaire and X owner Elon Musk in particular has angered the government with a series of provocative tweets, including that a British "civil war is inevitable". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Texas man was executed on Wednesday for the 1997 murder of a woman who was jogging in her Houston neighbourhood, one of two executions scheduled this week in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Arthur Lee Burton, 54, was put to death via lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, and pronounced dead at 6:47 pm Central time, officials from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the western state of Utah is scheduled to carry out an execution overnight, its first in 14 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taberon Honie, 48, is to be put to death shortly after midnight Mountain Time (0600 GMT Thursday) for the 1998 murder and sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend's mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Honie is to be executed by lethal injection at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Utah's last execution was carried out by firing squad in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton, the death row inmate in Texas, was convicted of the July 1997 murder of Nancy Adleman, a mother of three who was attacked while out jogging. Adleman was strangled with her own shoelaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court to stay his execution but the request was denied without comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorneys had argued that Burton should be constitutionally exempt from being put to death because he is intellectually disabled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To all the people I have hurt and caused pain, I wish we didn't have to be here at this moment, but I want you to know that I am sorry for putting y'all through this," Burton said in his final statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including Burton, Texas has carried out three executions since January and there have been 11 in the United States this year so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 US states, while six others (Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee) have moratoriums in place. (AFP)
