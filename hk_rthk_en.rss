<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) on Tuesday issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 5.40pm, as Tropical Cyclone Yagi neared the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HKO added the chance of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 was relatively high later this week, as Yagi is edging closer to the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong and Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the influence of Yagi, the weather over the coast of Guangdong will deteriorate in the latter part of this week. There will be heavy squally showers and seas will be rough with swells," the Observatory said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to take note of the latest weather forecast.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A transformed museum documenting China's resistance against the Japanese invasion is set to open on Wednesday, with Chief Executive John Lee calling it "an important base" for patriotic education.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence was renamed the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence, focusing on the history of the War of Resistance and the city's military affairs, to cultivate a stronger sense of national esteem and patriotism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The name change was made on Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the museum now combines the existing relics of coastal defence with exhibitions on the war, to allow visitors to experience "the resolute resistance" of the Chinese people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The history of the war against Japan reminded us to cherish the hard-fought peace. It is an important teaching material for young people to learn the deeds of the martyrs, and deepen their feeling for the nation and traditional cultural connotations," Lee said at an unveiling ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence will become one of the important bases for patriotic education."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revamped museum will see its first thematic exhibition, jointly presented by local and mainland authorities, highlighting the resistance activities of the East River Column in Shenzhen and Hong Kong during the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The museum's curator, Rebecca Cheung, said the exhibition is very important to "convey the idea of patriotism" and to understand the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The East River Column was not only a pillar of the resistance of southern China, but also made a significant contribution to the national victory in the war," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said people are encouraged to donate items and photos relating to the war to the museum for future exhibitions and research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be four exhibition galleries to showcase the history of the War of Resistance at the museum in Shau Kei Wan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will launch an anti-discrimination investigation into Canada's tariff hikes on electric vehicles (EVs) as well as steel and aluminium products imported from China, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing will also launch anti-dumping investigations into rapeseed imports and certain Canadian chemical products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry said Ottawa adopted "discriminatory unilateral restrictive measures" targeting Chinese imports, and China will file an appeal to the World Trade Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada announced last week that it will implement a 100 percent surtax on all Chinese-made EVs, effective October 1, and impose a 25 percent surtax on imports of steel and aluminium products from China from October 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It followed moves by the United States and the European Union to slap tariffs on Chinese EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has criticised the imposition of levies on EVs, calling them unfair and protectionist. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Cathay's handling of engine glitch 'professional'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768907_1_20240903153255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A flight engineering expert said on Tuesday the public should not worry about aircraft safety, after Cathay Pacific grounded its A350 flights due to an engine glitch on Monday which forced its Zurich-bound aircraft to fly back to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The carrier said on Tuesday that ongoing maintenance work had identified 15 airplanes whose engine components had problems which require replacements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the affected planes were expected to be able to fly again on Saturday. Cathay has 48 A350 aircraft in its fleet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warren Chim, the deputy chair of the Institute of Engineers' aircraft division, told RTHK he doesn't think passengers have to worry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the case required a "mandatory occurrence report", meaning it could lead to hazardous or potentially hazardous conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the engineer thinks Cathay's handling of the matter was professional.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As what we observed, everything after the incident happened in accordance with the established process and established procedures," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So as a passenger, I don't think we need to over-worry about that because all the processes and procedures are according to the international practice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chim stressed not only does Cathay need to report the case to local and European authorities, all engine parts will have to go through stringent tests before the planes can fly again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike Ng, an engineering lecturer with the Institute of Vocational Education, said there were around 600 A350 planes in operation around the world, and whether other airlines would be affected could depend on whether those engine parts came from the same batch as Cathay's faulty components.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's Working Group on Patriotic Education came out with a theme song on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Titled "Our Home", the song was sung by sub-group member Cally Kwong - a Cantopop singer who was active during the 1980s. She is also a local deputy to the National People's Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The city has been through a lot in the past years and I have always wanted to produce a song that could bring warmth to the people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong also shared her favourite verses by singing it out loud when meeting the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Convenor Starry Lee revealed that it took them around a year to work on the project after deciding to roll out a song for promoting patriotism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that using [music] is one of the most effective means to [generate enthusiasm] because we all know that, especially children, teenagers, they all love songs. Actually not only students, teenagers, different ages of people, different sectors of people, go to karaoke, or when attending functions, they will choose songs to express their feelings," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope this song will become very popular among different ages, different people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who's also the SAR's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said production costs were low, adding Kwong does not claim any copyright to the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pointed out that a USB-drive will be distributed to primary and secondary schools, so that they can sing the song during lesson time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also rolled out a karaoke version and has made a QR code available for the public to download it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee called on everyone to sing the song before and after National Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added many activities will be rolled out for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and details will be announced later.

 Cathay Pacific says inspections carried out following the inflight failure of an engine component on one of its A350s have found 15 aircraft in need of repairs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's flag carrier has cancelled dozens of flights since a glitch forced the return of a plane bound for Zurich on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maintenance activity on our A350 fleet is progressing well. Our engineering team have thoroughly inspected our fleet of operational A350 aircraft within 24 hours," Cathay said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In total, we have identified 15 aircraft with affected engine components that require replacement and three have already gone through successful repairs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The remaining 12 aircraft in need of replacement parts were expected to resume operations by Saturday, the airline said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it expected to cancel another 20 regional flights on Wednesday, but that no long-haul services would be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the remaining cancellations up to Saturday (7 September), we will provide further details by 2:00pm tomorrow [Wednesday]," the airline said.

    Putin visits Mongolia despite global arrest warrant

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Mongolia on Tuesday with no sign the host country would bow to calls to arrest him on an international warrant for alleged war crimes stemming from the conflict in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trip is Putin’s first to a member country of the International Criminal Court (ICC) since it issued a warrant for his arrest about 18 months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of his visit, Ukraine called on Mongolia to hand Putin over to the court in The Hague, and the European Union expressed concern that Mongolia might not execute the warrant. A spokesperson for Putin said last week that the Kremlin was not worried.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit puts Mongolia in a tough spot. Members of the international court are bound to detain suspects if an arrest warrant has been issued, but Mongolia is a landlocked country highly dependent on Russia for fuel and some of its electricity. The court doesn't have a mechanism to enforce its warrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian leader was welcomed in a ceremony at the capital city's main square by an honour guard dressed in vivid red and blue uniforms styled on those of the personal guard of 13th century ruler Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and Mongolian President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh walked up the red-carpeted steps of the Government Palace and bowed before a statue of Genghis Khan before entering the government building for their meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICC has accused Putin of being responsible for the abductions of children from Ukraine, where the fighting has raged for 2.5 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the European Union expressed concern the ICC warrant might not be carried out and said it shared its concern with the Mongolian authorities. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has launched a programme to make it easier for non-local professionals who have come to Hong Kong through talent schemes to join volunteer services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the launch ceremony on Tuesday, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the initiative aims to help new arrivals integrate into the local community and allow them to contribute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the platform in place, we expect more of the talents to join us, join hands with Hong Kong local people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So together, we believe they can contribute to our society as volunteers, and we also can benefit from their expertise and also their passion towards Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, Sun confirmed that he has received a proposed list of members for a disciplinary panel under the Social Workers Registration Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The confirmation came after local reports said social worker Jackie Chen, who is involved in a rioting court case, had been removed from the list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I, as the Secretary, am satisfied with the list, we're going to publish it in the Gazette. I can confirm we have received the recommended list from the board. So after vetting the list, we're going to publish the list in the Gazette as part of the legal requirement," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the Legislative Council passed a bill to reform the board, raising the number of government-appointed members.

 Pope Francis arrived in Muslim-majority Indonesia on Tuesday to kick off a four-nation tour of the Asia-Pacific that will be the longest and farthest of the 87-year-old's papacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The head of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics touched down in Jakarta for a three-day visit devoted to inter-religious ties, and will then travel to Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12-day tour will test the pontiff's increasingly fragile health, but he is often energised by being among his flock and in recent weeks has appeared in good spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pope was due to have a relaxing day in Jakarta on Tuesday following the long flight from Rome, then meet President Joko Widodo on Wednesday in the first major set piece of his visit to the world's most populous Muslim-majority country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catholics currently represent fewer than three percent of the population of Indonesia -- about eight million people, compared with the 87 percent, or 242 million, who are Muslim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they are one of six officially recognised religions or denominations in the secular nation, including Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Francis will meet representatives of all six at Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia and a symbol of religious co-existence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is linked via a "tunnel of friendship" to the cathedral across the road, where Christians in recent days have been taking selfies with a life-sized cutout of the pope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will then host a mass and deliver a sermon at Indonesia's 80,000-seater national football stadium. (AFP)

    Brazil's supreme court panel upholds X ban

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brazil's Supreme Court ratified the decision by one of its judges to suspend Elon Musk's X social network for alleged judicial transgressions. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768883_1_20240903130013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian Supreme Court panel on Monday unanimously upheld the decision of one of its justices to block billionaire Elon Musk’s social media platform X nationwide, according to the court’s website.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The broader support among justices undermines the effort by Musk and his supporters to cast Justice Alexandre de Moraes as an authoritarian renegade who is intent on censoring political speech in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel that voted in a virtual session comprised five of the full bench’s 11 justices, including de Moraes, who last Friday ordered the platform blocked for refusing to name a local legal representative, as required by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will stay suspended until it complies with his orders and pays outstanding fines that as of last week exceeded US$3 million, according to his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The platform has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to block users, and has alleged that de Moraes wants an in-country legal representative so that Brazilian authorities can exert leverage over the company by having someone to arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Moraes also set a daily fine of 50,000 reais (US$8,900) for people or companies using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some legal experts questioned the grounds for that decision and how it would be enforced, including Brazil’s bar association, which said it would request the Supreme Court review that provision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, with tens of millions of users. Its block marked a dramatic escalation in a monthslong feud between Musk and de Moraes over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the weekend, many X users in Brazil said they felt disconnected from the world and began migrating en masse to alternative platforms, like Bluesky and Threads. (AP)

    UK suspends some arms exports to Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy makes a statement to Parliament on UK arms sales to Israel. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768871_1_20240903120720.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government on Monday said it was suspending exports of some weapons to Israel because they could be used to break international law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK government had concluded there is a “clear risk” some items could be used to “commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told lawmakers the decision related to about 30 of 350 existing export licences for equipment “that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza," including parts for military planes, helicopters and drones, along with items used for ground targeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision wasn't “a determination of innocence or guilt” about whether Israel had broken international law, and wasn't an arms embargo, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on X: “Deeply disheartened to learn of the sanctions placed by the UK Government on export licences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Kingdom is among a number of Israel’s long-standing allies whose governments are under growing pressure to halt weapons exports because of the toll of the nearly 11-month-old conflict in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians in its toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war broke out on October 7 after Hamas militants and others stormed into Israel and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roughly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Tuesday said it would issue the Standby Signal No. 1 this evening and there was a relatively high chance it would issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Forecasters said the number one signal was scheduled to be issued sometime between 5pm and 8pm on Tuesday, as Tropical Cyclone Yagi was expected to remain more than 600 kilometres away from Hong Kong and wasn't expected to directly affect the SAR yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With Yagi edging closer to the coast of southern China gradually, winds will strengthen over the region later this week. The chance for issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 is relatively high," the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it expected heavy squally showers and rough seas with swells, as the weather for coastal Guangdong was expected to worsen in the latter part of the week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Uruguay icon Luis Suarez announced his retirement from international football on Monday, confirming that the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Paraguay will be his last international match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Friday will be my last match for my country," an emotional Suarez, 37, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was not an easy decision to make, but I do it with the peace of mind that I will give my maximum until the very last game of my Uruguay career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Barcelona and Liverpool striker is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and will retire from international football as Uruguay's top scorer with 69 goals from 142 appearances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suarez, who was infamously kicked out of the 2014 World Cup after being handed a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, made his debut for Uruguay in 2007.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Inter Miami forward helped Uruguay capture the 2011 Copa America, where he was named player of the tournament, and would eventually represent the South American country in nine major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suarez said Monday that inspiring Uruguay to that Copa crown had been the highpoint of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't trade the Copa America title for anything," he said. "It was the best moment of my career. I wouldn't trade it for anything." (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's consumer inflation slowed in August to the weakest in nearly 3-1/2 years, official data showed on Tuesday, supporting market expectations for an easing of monetary policy as early as next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index rose 2.0 percent from a year earlier, after gaining 2.6 percent the previous month, marking the slowest annual rise since March 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It matched the median 2.0 percent increase tipped in a Reuters survey of economists and the central bank's medium-term inflation target of 2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, unless there is any additional shock from weather conditions or global oil prices, consumer inflation is expected to stabilise in the lower 2 percent range," said Vice Finance Minister Kim Beom-seok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the Bank of Korea held interest rates steady at their highest in nearly 16 years but revived expectations for a policy easing that some economists see happening as soon as October as growth concerns overshadow inflation worries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank said Tuesday's data showed inflation was stabilising more quickly than in other major economies, and expects prices to maintain a stable trend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, the index was up 0.4 percent, the fastest in six months, after rising 0.3 percent in the prior month and beating forecast by economists for 0.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy items, rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier, slowing from the previous month's 2.2 percent rise and marking the weakest since November 2021. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday appealed for witnesses after a vehicle fell into the sea from Shenzhen Bay Bridge on Monday night; killing the driver, a 46-year-old customs officer. The incident happened at 9.18 pm on the bridge's northbound section.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, police said the car had reportedly gone out of control, rammed into an information road sign on the hard shoulder, then bounced over the barriers before plunging into the sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police officers and firemen sped to the scene and conducted search and rescue operation in the vicinity. The car was located at the bottom of the sea. The driver was trapped inside the compartment and later rescued by firemen. Sustaining multiple injuries, the man was rushed to Tin Shui Wai Hospital in an unconscious state and was certified dead at 1.30 am today," the statement said.

   Four-time Paralympian John Loung kicked off a medal spree for the SAR at the men's boccia individual BC1 final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old took a commanding lead after three ends against South Korea's Jung Sungjoon, and held on for a 4-1 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coach Marco Lau revealed Loung didn't think it was possible to reach the final, let alone win a gold medal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Thank you to our head coach, Kwok Hart-wing, and other coaches who have helped him a lot," Lau said after the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, a thank you to Leung Yuk-wing for assisting his teammates quite a bit in their training," he added, citing the veteran SAR bowler.

    Just hours later, Ho Yuen-kei clinched a second gold medal for Hong Kong at the South Paris Arena.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The third time has proven to be a charm for Ho, who defeated Australia's Jamieson Leeson 4-2 in the women's individual BC3 final.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "This gold medal isn't just for me. It's for everyone who helped me and for all the audience," she said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I hope our 23 athletes at the Paralympics in France show that we aren't just doing well because we have worked very hard despite our disabilities. We want to send a message that we're all the same and share the Hong Kong spirit of never giving up."

     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Paralympic debutant was defeated by China's Lin Ximei at the women's individual BC4.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I am not very satisfied with my overall performance ... I was too nervous, so I wasn't playing as freely as I should, but I am still very happy to be able to win a silver medal," Cheung said as she looked ahead to the mixed pairs competition.

     Wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan finished on the podium for the second straight Games, this time winning a silver as he lowered the curtain for his illustrious career.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 39-year-old veteran was beaten by world number one Japanese Daiki Kajiwara in straight games of 10-21 in the men's singles WH2.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The result was still one step better than his bronze-medal finish in Tokyo three years ago.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Speaking after the match, a tearful Chan said waist pain affected his performance.
     <br/>

     <br/>
     "I really put in a lot of effort. Before the competition, my waist was so painful that I couldn't even turn around. I had to ask the therapist for help, and take medication," he revealed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I want to compete like a 20-year-old, but I haven't been able to do that in recent years."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But there was heartbreak for fellow SAR shuttler Chu Man-kai, who missed out on a medal after losing to his Brazil's Vitor Tavares 2-1 in the men's singles SH6 bronze medal match.

     It wasn't quite a happy ending for the two Hong Kong table tennis players either.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Leung Chung-yan concluded his Paralympic debut when he was beaten in the last 16 of the men's singles MS11 by Peter Palos of Hungary.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the women's, Ng Mui-wui also bowed out after losing to her Brazilian opponent 3-0 in the WS11 singles round of 16.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany men's football coach Julian Nagelsmann said Monday he had tapped Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich to take over as national team captain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kimmich was a "role model for the whole group", Nagelsmann said at a press conference ahead of Germany's Nations League fixture against Hungary in Duesseldorf on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He always gives his all, he always wants to train – sometimes too much – he is never tired, he always wants to win," Nagelsmann said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich, 29, was "number one" in a player leadership group alongside Real Madrid defender Antonio Ruediger and Arsenal striker Kai Havertz, Nagelsmann said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three had a "good connection" with the rest of the squad, the coach added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich takes over from Ilkay Gundogan, who captained Germany at Euro 2024 on home soil before retiring from international football in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich has served as vice-captain of Germany since September 2023, having been promoted to the role behind Gundogan by former coach Hansi Flick, and is one of the country's most experienced players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder will be tasked with leading a new generation of German footballers, with Gundogan as well as 2014 World Cup winners Toni Kroos, Thomas Mueller and Manuel Neuer all retiring from international duty in recent weeks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan has wrapped up his illustrious career by collecting a silver medal for Hong Kong, China at the Paralympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old veteran insisted he was proud of his performance, despite not being at his best on the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two came up short against Daiki Kajiwara, the top seed from Japan, losing 10-21, 10-21 in the men's singles WH2 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was still one step better than his bronze-medal finish in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>

  Speaking after the match, a tearful Chan revealed lower back pain hampered his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I really put in a lot of effort. Before the competition, my waist was so painful that I couldn't even turn around. I had to ask the therapist for help, and take medications," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to compete like a 20-year-old, but I haven't been able to do that in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stood by his decision to hang up his racquet, saying he wanted to have a good rest and recuperate from the "tormenting" chronic spasms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was heartbreak for fellow SAR shuttler Chu Man-kai, who missed out on a medal after losing to Brazil's Vitor Tavares 21-23, 21-16, 12-21 in the men's singles SH6 bronze medal match.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Customs officer has died after his vehicle fell into the sea from Shenzhen Bay Bridge on Monday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at about 9 pm on Monday of a traffic accident on the northbound route of the Shenzhen Bay Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, chief inspector Chui Wing-luen said the road was dry and there was no road maintenance work at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Officers found two skid marks on the fast lane of the road and a damaged road maintenance sign on the slow lane. There were also signs of impact on the railings. We believed the vehicle plunged off the bridge after the accident," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fire Services Department said the diving team took over two hours to locate the vehicle, and rescuers retrieved the driver's body from the car at around midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An assistant divisional officer Yu Wai-wah said conditions weren't favourable for the search and rescue mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The water is shallow and the environment is dark. The visibility is very low underwater, which made the search more difficult," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the driver was sent to Tin Shui Wai Hospital where he was later certified dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said there were no surveillance cameras at the scene, but officers would inspect the vehicle and try and find out how fast it was travelling at the time of the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner of Customs and Excise Louise Ho expressed deep condolences over the passing of the officer, who died while heading to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the man was a senior customs officer stationed at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former champion Daniil Medvedev reached his fifth US Open quarter-final in six years on Monday with a straight-sets victory over unseeded Nuno Borges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Medvedev, the 2021 winner in New York, outclassed Borges, who was bidding to become the first Portuguese man to make a Grand Slam quarter-final, 6-0, 6-1, 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Medvedev will meet Jannik Sinner for a place in the semi-finals if the world number one Italian defeats Tommy Paul of the United States in his last-16 clash in the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I played Tommy twice this season. I beat him once but I feel as if he should have beaten me both times," said Medvedev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had unbelievable battles with Jannik. It will be very physical for both of us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medvedev is the only former champion left in the tournament after the shock exits of Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German automotive giant Volkswagen said on Monday it could take the unprecedented move to close production sites in Germany and threatened further job cuts as its savings plans stalled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rising costs at the carmaker were cutting into profits, leaving Volkswagen facing "particularly significant challenges", the group said in an internal memo seen by AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the current situation, even plant closures at vehicle production and component sites can no longer be ruled out," Volkswagen said in the note sent to employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unions and government officials responded with alarm to the idea of plant closures in the group's home market, a decision never before taken by Volkswagen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement by one of Germany's blue-chip companies adds to concerns for Chancellor Olaf Scholz after the domestic economy has struggled in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation," Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume was quoted as saying in the memo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market," Blume said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The difficulties were particularly acute in Germany, which "is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness" as a manufacturing location, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We as a company must now act decisively," the CEO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Volkswagen last year announced plans for a $US11 billion savings programme and has flagged cuts to its workforce over the coming years to improve profitability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the group said further measures were now required after disappointing results published in August that showed a dip in profits. (AFP)

    Biden says Netanyahu not doing enough on hostage deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough on securing a ceasefire. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768794_1_20240903002658.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Monday said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not doing enough to secure a deal for the release of hostages taken by Palestinian group Hamas and a ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Asked by reporters at the White House, where Biden was arriving for a meeting with US negotiators, if he thought the Israeli leader was doing enough on the issue, the president responded: "No."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's meeting with the negotiators on the hostage-release deal comes after the deaths on Saturday of six captives in Gaza, including an American citizen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Biden expressed his devastation and outrage at the murder, and reaffirmed the importance of holding Hamas's leaders accountable," a White House statement said after the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running to succeed him in November's US presidential election, were briefed by negotiators "on the status of the bridging proposal outlined by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the meeting, Biden had said negotiators were "very close" to a final proposal to be presented to Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said the Situation Room briefing had been attended by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA Director William Burns, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and other senior US officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, along with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar, has spent months claiming to be pushing for a hostage-prisoner exchange and ceasefire in the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,786 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to the health ministry in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN's human rights office. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific said it has cancelled 48 flights after discovering an engine glitch in one of its A350 aircraft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's flag carrier said it identified an engine component failure in an A350 aircraft en route to Zurich on Monday. That forced the flight to return to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This component was the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide," Cathay said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier has since inspected all 48 of its A350 aircraft and found that some of the same components required replacement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said 48 flights operating through Tuesday were cancelled. Affected passengers have been informed and offered alternative travel arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each aircraft is undergoing a rigorous inspection. Upon completion, the aircraft cleared for operation will return to service, while those identified with technical issues will undergo further repair and maintenance work," Cathay's engineering director Keith Brown said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, we are liaising with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and the aircraft and engine manufacturers.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia athlete Annie Cheung on Monday added a silver medal for Hong Kong, China in the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant, 25, was defeated by China's Lin Ximei 5-1 in the women's individual BC4 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin scored a point in each of the first two ends for a 2-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third end, a series of miscues by Cheung widened the gap, with Lin scoring three more times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung picked up one point in the fourth and final end but it was not enough to overcome the deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's victory in the final avenged her loss to Cheung in their inaugural pool match in the preliminary round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not very satisfied with my overall performance, especially in the final. I was too nervous, so I wasn't playing as freely as I should. But I am still very happy to be able to win a silver medal," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I try to regroup as quickly as possible... and I hope to achieve good results in the mixed pairs event."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will compete in the boccia's mixed pairs event alongside six-time Paralympian Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Cheung on winning the silver medal, praising her for staying resilient against the world's best athletes throughout the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, SAR table tennis player Leung Chung-yan ended his Paralympic debut when he was beaten in the last 16 of the men's MS-11 singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost 6-11, 11-8, 6-11 and 6-11 to Peter Palos of Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team have now captured one gold, two silvers and a bronze at the Paris Paralympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia player John Loung on Monday won Hong Kong's first gold medal in the Paris Paralympics, bowling his way to victory in the men's individual BC1 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Loung, who is competing in his fourth Paralympics, beat Jung Sung-joon of South Korea 4-1 to reach the top of the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete went ahead by scoring two points in end one, and then added a point in each of the next two ends, before Jung responded with a point in the final end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung cheered and waved to the crowd after his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on behalf of Loung after the match, his coach Marco Lau said the athlete did not think it was possible to reach the final, let alone win a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung also paid tribute to his coaches as well as veteran boccia star Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to our head coach, Kwok [Hart-wing], and other coaches who have helped me a lot. And also, thank you to Leung Yuk-wing, for assisting his teammates quite a bit in their training," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Loung on winning gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "John Loung demonstrated unwavering determination and superb skills in the competition, claiming the first gold medal for the Hong Kong, China Delegation at this year's Paralympic Games," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His gold medal is well-deserved. All Hong Kong people and I are thrilled and proud of his outstanding performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR has won three medals at the Paralympics so far, which include a silver and bronze in swimming.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New World Development's share price plunged to a 21-year low on the back of its expected net loss of HK$20 billion. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768743_2_20240902181343.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of New World Development, one of Hong Kong's major property developers, ended the day nearly 13 percent lower after it estimated a net loss of as much as HK$20 billion for the financial year ending in June.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shares fell to HK$6.74 in early trading, marking a 21-year low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finished the day at HK$6.83.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said in a Friday filing it expected a drop of as much as 23 percent in core operating profit from continuing operations due to a lack of revenue and it would have fair value and impairment losses of as much as HK$9.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with the continuous interest rate hikes experienced during the year as well as the depreciation of renminbi, the group expects to record a net loss," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company also said the provisions were one-off non-cash and unrealised items and did not affect the group's cash flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New World has one of the highest debt-to-equity ratios among Hong Kong's property developers and its de-leveraging plan has been closely watched over the past year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Hong Kong has not seen any major defaults by its property developers, like in China, investors worry about weakening liquidity for the sector due to sluggish residential and commercial property markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New World's full-year loss estimate follows a first-half net loss of HK$5.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JPMorgan analysts said in a note to clients that New World's loss "is not as drastic as the headline suggests", because its pro-forma core net loss may only be HK$2-3 billion if non-cash items like the impairment loss and losses on asset sales are excluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The net loss situation is more a status quo. For New World Development, the more important consideration is not earnings, but the balance sheet and refinancing ability," JPMorgan said, adding the developer secured HK$16 billion in loan arrangements in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New World is expected to report its earnings later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its stock has slid some 80 percent since its peak in mid-2021, just before the debt crisis in China's property sector began to emerge. It currently has a market cap of around HK$17.15 billion. (Reuters)

    SAR primed for new productive forces: Beijing official

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Beijing official in Hong Kong on Monday said the SAR is the most suitable place to develop new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a summit, Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, said talent is key, as he hailed Hong Kong's top-notch research and development teams, as well as its convenient global connections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre. Finance and innovation and technology are intertwined, and Hong Kong has incubated more than 4,200 start-ups. It is a petrol station for the development of new quality productive forces," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has unique and unparalleled conditions to develop new quality productive forces."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng also brought up "tourism is everywhere", a concept suggested by Xia Baolong, the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trade should think about how to make good use of the beautiful 1,180 kilometres of coastline and 263 islands, how to support Hong Kong's tourism with animation, performing arts, e-sports, healthcare, artificial intelligence and coastal sports, and how to provide a top destination for leisure and vacation for the more than 500 million middle- and high-class people on the mainland," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, at the same event, vowed to speed up the development of new quality productive forces and said overseas talent will be a focus for the administration.

  "The government is fully committed to providing broader space for entrepreneurship and employment for talents in innovation and technology, encouraging industry and academia to work together to cultivate them, and to offer them richer practical opportunities," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we continue to improve our talent schemes to attract more global talent and to become a place for high-end international talent to gather."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a newspaper interview, Lee said those who came to Hong Kong via various talent schemes generally earn more than the median monthly income.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Liberal Party on Monday called on the government to provide the TV rights for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles for free to major broadcasters in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party surveyed 1,047 people, with around 70 percent of them backing the idea of the government buying the official rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities secured the television rights for the Paris Olympics, enabling live broadcasts on four free-to-air television channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Southern District Councillor Jonathan Leung, who is also from the Liberal Party, said the free broadcasting rights had ignited an Olympic fervour across the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said the government should ensure that people in Hong Kong could watch the Los Angeles Games for free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This Olympics, we can see that the media tried so hard to broadcast, to show our citizens how good this Olympics is. I believe they all benefited from the free broadcasting this year," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they would [be] happy to see the government purchase the next Olympics broadcasting [rights], and they would share the benefit. I think it's good for all of us - the television, the media, and the citizens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to concerns over the remuneration local athletes receive, Leung called on businesses to offer more sponsorship and job opportunities to athletes.

    Mass strike brings disruptions to Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters stand around a fire on a highway during an anti-government rally in Tel Aviv calling for the release of Israeli hostages. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768725_1_20240902161400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rare call for a general strike in Israel to protest the failure to return hostages held in Gaza led to closures and other disruptions around the country on Monday, including at its main international airport. But it was ignored in some areas, reflecting deep political divisions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of Israelis had poured into the streets late Sunday in grief and anger after six hostages were found dead in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The families and much of the public blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying they could have been returned alive in a deal with Hamas to end the nearly 11-month-old war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But others support Netanyahu's strategy of maintaining relentless military pressure on Hamas, whose October 7 attack into Israel triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say it will eventually force the militants to give in to Israeli demands, potentially lead to more successful rescues and ultimately annihilate the group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, called for a general strike for Monday, the first since the start of the war. It aims to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking, health care and the country’s main airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airlines at Israel’s main international airport Ben-Gurion were halting outgoing flights between 8 and 10am. Those flights either departed early or were slightly delayed, and travellers were seen lining up at check-in counters despite the limited disruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arriving flights were continuing as usual during that time, according to the Israel Airports Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks, some large malls and government offices were all closed due to the strike and public transit was limited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Municipalities in Israel’s populated central area, including Tel Aviv, were participating in the strike, leading to shortened school hours and cancellations for public daycares and kindergartens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many municipalities, however, including Jerusalem, were not participating in the strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli media reported that the state appealed to a labour court to cancel the strike, saying it was politically motivated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations on Sunday appeared to be the largest since the start of the war, with organisers estimating that up to 500,000 people joined nationwide events and the main rally held in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli media estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 took part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are demanding that Netanyahu reach a deal to return the remaining roughly 100 hostages held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, even if it means leaving a battered Hamas intact and withdrawing from the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Israelis support this position, but others prioritise the destruction of the militant group over freedom for the hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has pledged “total victory” over Hamas and blames it for the failure of the negotiations, which have dragged on for much of this year. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A green turtle that was rescued in 2022 was released back into the sea on Monday, according to a spokesman from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The turtle had been under the care of Ocean Park Hong Kong (OPHK) since it was rescued by AFCD staff from waters near Chi Ma Wan Peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The green turtle weighs around 39 kilogrammes, and its carapace length measures about 66 centimetres. It was assessed by the veterinarians of OPHK as being in good condition and ready to return to the sea," an AFCD spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department is thankful to the veterinarians and staff of OPHK for taking care of it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers released the green turtle in the southern waters of Hong Kong, adding that a microchip, tag and satellite transmitter have been attached to it for future identification, and for tracking its movements and feeding grounds for conservation purposes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green turtles are a globally endangered species and the only sea turtle known to nest locally.

    Well-being design guide unveiled for public housing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Monday said that public housing tenants would soon be able to enjoy a better living environment that is more age-friendly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as the Housing Bureau and Housing Authority offered a glimpse on their well-being design guide for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team came up with eight concepts - health and vitality; green living and sustainability; age-friendly; inter-generational and inclusive living; family and community connection; urban connectivity; upward mobility; perception and image - after visiting 26 housing estates across 17 districts to seek the views of over 3,000 residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, under the inter-generational and inclusive living concept, a special area would be set up for vehicles such as medical vans, allowing residents easy access to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It may not just serve the elderly persons, although sometimes the health-related mobile services may relate to the elderly persons more, but there are also mobile libraries which the children and young mothers would be very interested in," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other facilities to improve the living environment include items such as exercise stations at convenient locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also gave an example on how a facility could achieve age inclusivity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Very usually, we see the grandparents bring their grandchildren to the playground. So if the grandchildren were playing, where should the grandparents sit?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Can they sit comfortably under the tree when they watch the children play, and at the same time, can the grandparents can have a social chat to share necessary information? That is the kind of environment we want to create,” Ho added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pilot programme will be launched at five existing estates - Kai Yip Estate, Fu Shan Estate, Chak On Estate, Shui Pin Wai Estate, and Mei Lam Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is believed that Hin Fat Estate and Yip Wong Road Phase 2 (Yip Wong Estate) will be the first two projects built under the new guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calvin Au, a researcher at the think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation, welcomes the introduction of the design guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au told RTHK that the authorities have to design public housing based on the needs of residents there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different people have different needs. The challenges would be how to pick the right design recommendation from the guide to apply to the right estate," he explained
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the architect and policymakers, they really have to have a good sense of what is the population they are planning to serve, the data, so they know about the population mix and they know what they need."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au also said it's important to cater to the needs of elderly residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our population is ageing, our building is ageing, and our senior residents have difficulty in their daily life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This guideline... can really gather resources across sectors and across society to really apply the newest technology and the newest design in a larger scenario such as public housing estate, which can really push forward the development of the age-friendly community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The details of the guidelines will be unveiled next Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The well-being design guide was proposed in Chief Executive John Lee’s maiden policy address back in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen reached the US Open quarter-finals for a second time with victory over Donna Vekic in a record late finish for a women's match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The encounter finished at 2:15am New York time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventh-seed Zheng won 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-2 against her 24th-ranked Croatian opponent who she also defeated in the Paris Olympics final four weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng will face Aryna Sabalenka next in what will be an Australian Open final rematch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At two o' clock in the morning, this is unbelievable. Thank you to the fans for not sleeping tonight and supporting me here," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donna is really tough to play in hard court. She put me in a lot of pressure. In France I was totally in control but today she hit really aggressive, it was really tough but a nice victory for me and I enjoyed it." (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia pounded Ukraine's capital of Kyiv with missiles on Monday, while officials said falling debris from the downed weapons injured at least two people, sparking fires and damaging homes and infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's air defence units destroyed more than 10 cruise missiles and nearly 10 ballistic missiles, Kyiv's military administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air raid alerts went out across Ukraine for nearly two hours before the air force declared the skies clear. Neighbouring NATO member Poland activated Polish and allied aircraft to keep its airspace safe during the attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boiler house at a Kyiv water plant was partially damaged as was the entrance to a metro station doubling as a bomb shelter in the Svyatoshynksyi district, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app, though the station still operates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The district is home to a cluster of universities and schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency services also went to the districts of Svyatoshynksyi, Holosiivskyi, and Solomyanskyi, where debris fell from destroyed missiles, Klitschko added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solomyanskyi is home to a major train station and Kyiv's main airport. The historic neighbourhood of Svyatoshynksyi is on the city's western edge, while Holosiivskyi is in its southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came exactly a week after Moscow launched more than 200 missiles and drones on Ukraine, killing seven people and striking energy facilities nationwide in what Kyiv called the war's "most massive" attack. (Reuters)

    Mixed feelings on first day back at school

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong pupils on Monday had mixed feelings about going back to school, with some happy to see their old friends again and others saying they wished the summer holiday was longer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I slept at around 9.30 last night because I was playing with my dad. [I miss the holiday] because I still want to play," said one pupil studying at a Tin Shui Wai school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another pupil said she was nervous because there would be many new faces in class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Education Secretary Christine Choi wished pupils a good start to the academic year, and highlighted the need for mental health support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said as of July, more than 420 schools had signed up for the government's 4Rs Mental Health Charter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 4Rs stand for rest, relaxation, relationship and resilience, and the charter is designed to address the plight of students struggling with their mental well-being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know some schools have their own mental health support programmes for students in progress or in future," she told reporters at a secondary school in Tuen Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that as those plans are gradually integrated, more and more schools will participate in the 4Rs mental health charter, to encourage students to rest and relax, improve their resilience, and establish good interpersonal relationships."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau has sent six advisory letters to follow up on a primary pupil who has reportedly been absent from school for more than two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the bureau hopes to help the pupil get back to school as soon as possible by getting in touch with different stakeholders.

 The observatory on Monday said it might issue the Standby Signal No.1 between Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night, with Tropical Cyclone Yagi intensifying into a severe tropical storm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said Yagi would be within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong on Tuesday and then edge close to the coast of southern China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added there was a high chance Yagi would move towards the vicinity of the western part of Guangdong and Hainan Island and would further intensify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the observatory forecast Yagi could strengthen to a typhoon by Thursday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A far-right party won a state election for the first time in post-World War II Germany on Sunday and looked set to finish a very close second to mainstream conservatives in a second vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A new party founded by a prominent leftist also made a strong impact, while the parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular national government obtained extremely weak results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 32.8 percent of the vote in Thuringia in the country's east — well ahead of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main national opposition party, with 23.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Saxony, projections put support for the CDU, which has led the state since German reunification in 1990, at 31.9 percent and AfD on 30.6-30.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AfD made substantial gains in Thuringia and smaller ones in Saxony compared with the last state elections in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An openly right-wing extremist party has become the strongest force in a state parliament for the first time since 1949, and that causes many people very deep concern and fear,” said Omid Nouripour, a leader of the Greens, one of the national governing parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parties say they won't put AfD in power by joining it in a coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, its strength is likely to make it extremely difficult to form new state governments, forcing other parties into exotic new coalitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a historic success for us,” Alice Weidel, a national co-leader of AfD, told Germany media. She described the result as a “requiem” for Scholz's coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CDU's national general secretary, Carsten Linnemann, said that “voters in both states knew that we wouldn't form a coalition with AfD, and it will stay that way — we are very, very clear on this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weidel denounced that as “pure ignorance” and said that “voters want AfD to participate in a government.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deep discontent with a national government notorious for infighting, anti-immigration sentiment and scepticism toward German military aid for Ukraine were among the factors that have contributed to support for populist parties in the region, which is less prosperous than western Germany. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index fell 126.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to open at 17,862.59 points on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as investors in the US have reportedly been switching from tech stocks, following results from tech giant Nvidia, into shares more likely to benefit from this month's expected interest rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected to kick off a rate-cutting cycle at its monetary policy meeting on September 17-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the Hong Kong dollar pegged to the US dollar, any interest cut in the US should also lead to cuts in the SAR. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and Reuters)

  Ng returned to the pool one night after finishing sixth in the women's SM6 200 metres individual medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant was second at the halfway mark of the SB6 100 metres breaststroke final, before being leapfrogged by China's world-record holder, Liu Daomin, towards the end.

  Ng touched the wall at 1:34.15, nearly two seconds behind Liu for bronze, while Britain's Maisie Summers-Newton retained her gold.

   At 14 years and five months old, Ng is now Hong Kong's youngest-ever Para medallist.

   She refreshed the previous record set by legendary sprinter So Wa-wai, who was 14 years and 10 months old when he bagged his maiden Paralympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
   <br/>

   Speaking after the race, Ng has set her sights on improving her stamina.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm happy I finished the event and won the second medal for team Hong Kong. For the last 25 metres, I couldn't maintain my pace. When I return to Hong Kong after the Paralympics, I hope to train harder and give my best in another competition," she said.

Many messaged me on Instagram or left comments, telling me they set an alarm to wake up and watch us play. I thank you very much for supporting Paralympians. It hasn't been easy for you," Ho said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Debutant Annie Cheung also breezed her way to the gold medal match, after beating her Malaysian rival 7-0 in the women's individual BC4.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the men's side, John Loung will be fighting for gold as well after defeating his opponent from Indonesia 4-3 in the men's individual BC1 semi-final.

    Liverpool beat Man Utd to maintain perfect Slot start

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot passed his first major examination as Liverpool manager with a statement 3-0 win at Manchester United thanks to Luis Diaz's double and a Mohamed Salah strike on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slot has the unenviable task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp but has made a perfect start with a 100 percent record from three Premier League games to sit alongside Manchester City at the top of the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everything you want to see as a manager you saw in this game," said Slot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second consecutive defeat leaves United boss Erik ten Hag already under pressure just three games into the new season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman survived an internal review at the end of last season after overseeing the club's worst ever Premier League finish of eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But all the hallmarks of United's failings last season were exposed by the impressive visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not like I'm Harry Potter," said Ten Hag."We just had a third game in the season and again we have to build a new team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be fine," he added. "It's clear we have to improve but at the end of the season I'm quite confident that we will have a big chance to lift another trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Liverpool's ascendency over United during Klopp's reign, the German managed to win only two of his 11 away games against United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time Liverpool were ruthless and could easily have matched their record 5-0 victory away to United in 2021. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Coco Gauff was knocked out of the US Open in the fourth round on Sunday by American compatriot Emma Navarro after a serving horror show.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 13th-seeded Navarro took advantage of third-ranked Gauff's 19 double faults and 60 unforced errors to win 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 and set up a quarter-final against Spain's Paula Badosa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not the summer that I want," said Gauff who exited Wimbledon in the fourth round and suffered early losses at the Olympics, Toronto and Cincinnati.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I feel like there's 70 other players in the draw that would love to have the summer that I had even though it's probably my least well done during this time of the year," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff's defeat means that Serena Williams remains the last woman to successfully defend the US Open title back in 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Navarro had defeated Gauff at Wimbledon in July and was dominant again on Sunday from the outset. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patients will be able to pick up their medications at community pharmacies from next week, the Hospital Authority (HA) has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HA launched a medication delivery service last year, allowing patients to receive their medications at home or at the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it will expand this service and allow patients to collect their medications at over 100 community pharmacies, under Mannings and Watsons, from September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Chui, chief pharmacist with the HA, said it would provide one more option for patients, and they will be able to receive professional help as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the professional, the community pharmacists, provide counselling and also drug information to patients who want more information about their medication or drug treatment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So [it's] not only for the delivery of the drugs but also providing immediate service or professional service to the patient."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the HA would look into expanding the scope to cover more pharmacies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the HA also aims to encourage Hong Kong residents to make use of primary healthcare services to reduce the workload on public hospitals and clinics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Pharmacists in the community provide information, and also professional advice on how to prevent disease, how to improve patients' health overall. I think this is a good start to let our patients make use of healthcare professionals in the community," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Grigor Dimitrov returned to the US Open quarter-finals for the first time since 2019 with a five-set triumph over Andrey Rublev on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ninth seed Dimitrov came through 6-3, 7-6 (7/3), 1-6, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a clash with either Frances Tiafoe of the United States or Alexei Popyrin, the conqueror of Novak Djokovic, for a place in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Dimitrov made the semi-finals in 2019 where he was defeated by Daniil Medvedev having stunned five-time champion Roger Federer in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was playing fairly good," said Dimitrov, the oldest player left in the men's draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But for some reason my body got tired a little bit and he wasn't going to give up the match. I had stay patient. I think the biggest thing today was my experience."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dimitrov saved 13 of 18 break points in the match and credited long-time friend and six-time women's champion Serena Williams for a helping hand.

  <br/>
  "She gave me a good pep talk yesterday," he said of the US tennis legend who was watching the match in Arthur Ashe Stadium. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Teenage swimmer Jasmine Ng clinched her first Paralympic bronze medal for Hong Kong, China, in the women’s 100m breaststroke SB6 event, becoming the youngest Hong Kong Paralympic medallist.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old touched home in a time of 1:34.15, less than three seconds behind British Maisie Summers-Newton who smashed the Paralympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Daomin took silver for the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng is now Hong Kong's youngest-ever Para medallist, refreshing the previous record set by legendary sprinter So Wa-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 14 years and five months old, she is five months younger than So when he took home his first Paralympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the race, the teenager has set her sights on improving her stamina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy I finished the event and won the second medal for team Hong Kong. For the last 25 metres, I couldn't maintain my pace. When I return to Hong Kong after the Paralympics, I hope to train harder and give my best in another competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the final of the mixed 4-by-100m Freestyle Relay S14, the SAR team of Chan Yui-lam, Cheung Ho-ying, Andy Cheung and Tang Wai-lok finished fourth out of five, clocking a time of 3:55.20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain took gold, Australia bagged silver and Brazil rounded off the podium.

    Gaza parents rush to vaccinate kids against polio

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A health worker administers the Polio vaccine to a Palestinian child in Zawayda in the central Gaza Strip.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ghadir Hajji rushed to a clinic on Sunday in hopes her five children would be among the first to get vaccinated against polio, which has re-emerged in war-ravaged Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "They absolutely have to be vaccinated," she told AFP as the family waited in line for a vaccine drive announced after health officials reported last month the first case of polio in the besieged territory in a quarter of a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We received text messages from the ministry of health and we showed up right away."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was joined by thousands of other Gazans whose fear of polio, which is highly contagious and potentially fatal, despite concerns for their personal security and rumours the vaccine would not be safe or effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polio-virus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water - an increasingly common problem in Gaza with much of the territory's infrastructure destroyed by Israel in its war against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one clinic alone in Deir el-Balah nearly 2,000 children were vaccinated on Sunday, said Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency had mobile teams going from tent to tent, marking kids' thumbs with ink once they received their doses, Wateridge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first doses were administered on Saturday to an unspecified number of children in the southern city of Khan Yunis, ahead of Sunday's large-scale rollout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign aims to vaccinate more than 640,000 children in the besieged Palestinian territory, devastated by almost 11 months of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the WHO said that Israel had agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in northern, southern and central areas to facilitate vaccinations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu however, has insisted that these pauses were not amounting to any kind of ceasefire in overall fighting in Gaza. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Charles Leclerc won the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday to delight Ferrari's massed ranks of fans as Lando Norris again chipped away at struggling champion Max Verstappen's lead in the Formula One drivers' standings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Monegasque Leclerc claimed victory at Monza for the second time after winning in 2019, holding off McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Norris in a thrilling race in which Verstappen finished nearly 38 seconds off the pace in sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huge roars engulfed the stands as Leclerc took the chequered flag after holding out on a set of hard tyres he had changed in his one and only pit stop on the 16th lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of his major rivals, apart from teammate Carlos Sainz who ended up finishing fourth, pitted twice and McLaren were hoping that the Ferrari pair would do the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But instead Leclerc managed to keep his tyres in good enough condition to stay ahead and in the end finish the race comfortably in front of Piastri, who had taken the race lead early on after a daring overtake manoeuvre on Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briton Norris, who clocked the fastest lap right at the end, will be disappointed by his finish after starting on pole but he managed to chop Verstappen's championship lead to 62 points with eight races remaining as his Dutch rival's barren run continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has now failed to win any of the last six GPs after claiming the honours in seven of the first 10, and his and Red Bull's dominance of F1 looks increasingly in question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth straight world title looked a near certainty when Verstappen won in Spain back in June, but since then he has only finished on the podium twice. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One in five teenagers exhibited symptoms of depression or anxiety, according to a survey released on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service, an NGO providing mental health support and counselling, interviewed 1,646 secondary pupils between last November and April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 25 percent of the respondents even displayed "medium" to "severe" levels of depression. When asked to self-evaluate, many said they felt useless, had nothing to look forward to or hated their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 37 percent of them also expressed dissatisfaction with their academic performance, while one in four felt distressed about their appearance and body shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is "concerning", according to Scarlet Poon Fung Oi, the group's assistant chief executive officer who reported the findings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, she believed the existing three-tier school-based emergency system is effective in identifying pupils with suicidal risks or high mental health needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government introduced the scheme in December last year with an aim to offer timely assistance to students going through mental health issues. The response came after multiple teenagers took their own lives in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical psychologist Jeff Kei advised teenagers to proactively seek help when needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes we tend to avoid or even suppress our emotions. This may help us navigate the world when we are stressed but in the long run, actually it may lead to more emotional problems," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think the first thing teenagers can do is to recognise and acknowledge their feelings. There are many online services or resources that can help them enhance their emotional well-being. So, don't hesitate to look for these resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the new school year begins on Monday, Kei also called on teachers and parents to offer additional support to pupils grappling with mental health issues.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday that preparations are underway at the Kai Tak Sports Park for a grand opening ceremony in the first quarter of next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his social media page, Lee said he and a number of his top officials inspected the sports park last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the main structure of the public sports ground, indoor sports centre and main stadium are almost complete, while the interior decoration and landscaping construction are still in progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the inspection, I asked the working group to ensure that the Kai Tak Sports Park is successfully completed and opened as scheduled to consolidate Hong Kong’s strategic positioning as a city of major events. At the same time, I reminded staff to pay attention to implementation details, strengthen adaptability and ensure smooth operations after the park is completed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kai Tak Sports Park will conduct different drills and trial opening activities before its official opening to allow for adjustments… it will also adjust strategies as needed to improve response efficiency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a video posted on the CE’s social media page, the main stadium will have about eight floors, with a seating capacity of 50,000. There will also be 28 concession stands and five bars, with one being amongst the longest in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said many local sports stars and artists are slated to attend the grand opening ceremony next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes that the new, state-of-the-art venue will not only drive sports development, but also generate substantial economic benefits to Hong Kong by stimulating the growth of the performing arts, tourism and other sectors.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians engaged in a dialogue with their counterparts from Macau on the second day of their visit to the gaming hub on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eight gold medallists from the Paris Games, including table tennis star Ma Long, diver Quan Hongchan, swimmer Pan Zhanle and gymnast Liu Yang, sat down for a sharing session with elite athletes from the SAR at the Olympic Sports Centre in Taipa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They discussed how to deal with pressure and injuries during the exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan, who refreshed his own 100m freestyle world record en route to victory in Paris, revealed his ambition to further improve his time and "let the world see the limit of humankind".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes then took part in a brief game of table tennis, followed by a gymnastics demonstration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a banquet at the Wynn Palace hotel on Saturday night, Macau chief executive Ho Iat-seng expressed his gratitude to the delegation, and urged teenagers to learn from the role models on how to persevere and love the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team's packed schedule continues with a gala show at the Macau East Asian Games Dome on Sunday night, before wrapping up their visit on Monday with a community event.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages in Gaza, including that of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, US President Joe Biden said late on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas," Biden said in a statement issued by the White House. "I am devastated and outraged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that the bodies of Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino had been brought to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial estimation, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them," military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas and its armed wing did not immediately comment on the accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 40,691 Palestinians have been killed and 94,060 injured in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since October 7, the enclave's health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war was triggered when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, clashes broke out between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters in the occupied West Bank as Israel pushed ahead with a military operation in the flashpoint city of Jenin. Hundreds of Israeli troops have been carrying out raids since Wednesday in one of their largest actions in the West Bank in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goldberg-Polin, captured at a music festival near Gaza, appeared in a video released by Hamas in late April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world," Biden said. His parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, "have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express," the president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden vowed that "Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement, "I strongly condemn Hamas’ continued brutality, and so must the entire world. Harris, the Democratic candidate running to succeed Biden, said she and he would never waver in their commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden said he was "still optimistic" about a ceasefire deal to stop the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're on the verge of having an agreement," he said. "It's time this war ended."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden added that "people are continuing to meet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think we can close the deal, they’ve all said they agree on the principles." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Fatman Scoop has died, his family and manager announced on Saturday, after the 53-year-old artist suffered a medical emergency while performing on stage, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of hip-hop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scoop, best known for the hit tracks "Be Faithful" and "It Takes Scoop," collapsed on stage at Hamden Town Center Park, Connecticut and was taken to hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical staff apparently attempted to administer CPR while he was still on the stage, according to a video of the incident obtained by celebrity news site TMZ. He was then carried away on a stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a post on his Instagram account, his family wrote that "it is with profound sadness and very heavy hearts that we share news of the passing of the legendary and iconic Fatman Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fatman Scoop was known to the world as the undisputed voice of the club. His music made us dance and embrace life with positivity," they wrote.

  <br/>
  Scoop's manager Birch Michael confirmed his death on Facebook, writing: "I love you Scoop. Thank you so much for everything you gave to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hip-hop star Missy Elliott wrote on X that Scoop's "voice and energy have contributed to many songs that made the people feel happy and want to dance for over two decades. Your impact is huge and will be never be forgotten."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Radio host Shelley Wade posted a photograph of herself with Scoop, writing: "We are losing too many of our hip-hop legends too soon. Rest easy, Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scoop briefly became embroiled in a political row in Australia in 2018 when the country's then-prime minister Scott Morrison posted a clip that featured his hit "Be Faithful."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morrison, a conservative evangelical Christian, deleted the post after his critics said the entertainer's lyrics were inappropriate and unparliamentary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's quite clear that that is not a song on my playlist," he later told reporters in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The uproar prompted a response from Scoop, who tagged Morrison in an Instagram post saying: "I am humbled to have my voice rocking in the highest offices of the Australian Government!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rapper defended his lyrics: "It's a fun PARTY SONG that has no NEGATIVITY or HARM in it!!" before extending Morrison a backstage invite to a festival appearance in Australia. (AFP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong has what it takes to be a regional processing hub for Australian exports, ahead of his five-day duty visit down under.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The financial chief departed for Sydney on Sunday. He will also visit Melbourne before returning to the SAR on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said he hopes to achieve three objectives in his latest trip, with luring investment being top of his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the highlights of this visit is to meet enterprises in the fields of biomedicine, new energy and fintech, and I will promote Hong Kong's strategic advantages and hopefully get them to set up shop in the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similarly, Chan also hoped to strengthen cooperation in green technology, citing his goal to develop Hong Kong into a "green finance centre" under this year's Budget.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also noted that Hong Kong imported HK$14.8 billion worth of Australian goods last year, including fresh produce, seafood and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia is now the city's second-largest source of imported wine by value, and the largest by volume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's highly interconnected and accessible air freight network, well-developed storage facilities and efficient customs clearance have made it a cost-effective transshipment hub for high-value goods," Chan explained, adding there is potential to further boost trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from meeting local business leaders, Chan will also attend an Asia Summit organised by the Australian Financial Review, and deliver a keynote speech.

    HK needs to beef up tech investment: Sun Dong

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong still has a long way to go before it can become a Silicon Valley-style international technology hub, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said the SAR has rolled out measures to boost the sector over the past two years, noting that the target of attracting 100 I&T enterprises to the territory within five years has been achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said there’s room to further boost investment in cutting-edge technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Hong Kong] government is investing more money on frontier technologies. Last year, it spent 1.07 percent of GDP on this, which is a record for Hong Kong. However, this is still low compared to nearby regions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, the mainland spends 2.7 to 2.8 percent of its GDP on research and technology. Cities like Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai spend even more, over 5 percent of their GDP."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the government needs to consider how to make the most out of its investments given the current financial climate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech chief also highlighted the need for the SAR to enhance its role as a super connector and super value-adder to lure more global talent.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The AFCD said people will no longer get verbal warnings for feeding wild pigeons. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768569_1_20240901111427.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities said people who're caught feeding wild pigeons will no longer get any verbal warning and will instead face immediate, on-the-spot fines of HK$5,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said pigeon feeders will face instant enforcement measures, after an amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law came into effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Amendment Ordinance has already been in effect for a month," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enforcement officers will take immediate enforcement action without prior verbal warnings upon discovering any person who is found to be illegally feeding wild animals or feral pigeons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by the Legislative Council in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has also been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD noted that officers will step up patrols across the territory, and work closely with other department to conduct joint enforcement operations.
