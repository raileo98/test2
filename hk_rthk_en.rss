<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday maintained a steady position in the pack after two more races in the men's dinghy event, with six still to come over the next three days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ranked 28th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 65 net points, compared with 32 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

    Alcaraz on track to be youngest Olympic tennis champ

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz became the youngest man to reach the Olympic Games men's tennis final on Friday when he thrashed Felix Auger-Aliassime.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, 21, swept to a 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Canadian in just 75 minutes and will meet Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final if the top-seeded Serb overcomes a knee injury and Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in the second semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an objective since the start of the year to try and win the gold medal and now we have one match left to try and get it done," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to have fun in the final and do the business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish star, playing on the same Roland Garros court where he won the French Open in June, broke the 19th-ranked Auger-Aliassime three times in the first set, racing away with six consecutive games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz broke again in the fourth and sixth games of the second set on his way to claiming a fourth successive win over the Canadian having lost the first three of the pair's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very complete performance and I played at a very high level from start to finish," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had very good feelings and sensations, I'm so happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The final is very important for me and the Spanish people but I try not to think about how important it is and will focus on the match," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wimbledon champion Alcaraz is the third Spanish man to reach the Olympic men's final after Jordi Arrese at Barcelona in 1992, Sergi Bruguera in Atlanta four years later and Rafael Nadal who won gold at Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now has the chance to become the youngest men's champion since tennis returned to the Olympics at Seoul in 1988. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said there were about 160,000 technology crime cases in the first half of the year, a 3.5 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said the total loss incurred in the cases amounted to HK$2.66 billion, and that they noted a surge in the use of blackmail apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Raymond Lam of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said tech crime in Hong Kong is on the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said though hacker groups are operating in the city, most cases involved overseas groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested that companies should be proactive when it comes to updating their devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of systems which the users do not update on time. If software and hardware are not updated on time, it will have a lot of loopholes. Therefore systems should be updated on time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Policy Office, meanwhile, said it checks government systems regularly, and it has not discovered loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Assistant Commissioner Daniel Cheung said they conduct spot checks, and any loopholes will be plugged immediately if any are found.

 Wang Zongyuan and Long Daoyi won the men's synchronised 3-metre springboard event at the Paris Olympics on Friday to claim the nation's fourth gold in diving.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both second-time Olympians, the pair finished on 446.10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, previously won gold in the same event in Tokyo three years ago with Xie Siyi, who is only competing in the individual event as defending champion in this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo trailed after the fourth of six dives, but they rallied on the final two dives to take China's fourth straight gold medal and stay on track for an unprecedented sweep of all eight diving events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long and Wang held off the Mexican team of Juan Celaya and Osmar Olvera with 444.03.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding of Britain took bronze with a score of 438.15. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Friday fought hard for the best rank he could get in the men’s single sculls at the Paris Olympic Games, despite dropping out of contention for a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu began in the second lane of the final group D race, where he was competing for the 19th to 24th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started off second in the first 500 metres, before pulling himself to the front of the pack in the next 1,000 metres. But Quentin Antognelli of Monaco came from behind to overtake Chiu in the end with a time of 6 minutes and 54.93 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we were unable to get a medal, I hope this serves as motivation and inspiration for younger rowers," Chiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want them to fight hard for their dreams and dream big, and we can have higher and faster results in future international events,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who finished second out of six other rowers in his race with a time of 6 minutes and 56.65 seconds, ranked 20th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He previously competed in the Rio Olympic Games, where he finished 19th in the lightweight double sculls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Table tennis powerhouse China has secured places in both the men's and women's singles finals at the Paris Olympics, after Fan Zhendong and Chen Meng made it through on Friday in dominant fashion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, the second seed on the men's side, crushed local favourite Felix Lebrun 4-0 in a little more than half an hour in the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan won 11-8, 11-6, 11-7 and 11-5 to silence the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became China's only medal hopeful in the men's singles after top-seeded Wang Chuqin was stunned by Sweden's Truls Moregard in an earlier round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-seeded Lebrun, who's only 17, did manage a three-point lead in the third game, but was otherwise outclassed by Fan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will face Moregard in the final, after the Swede defeated Brazil's Hugo Calderano 4-2 in a gruelling semi-final matchup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chen has a chance to retain her Olympic singles title, after an emphatic 4-0 trouncing of South Korea's Shin Yubin in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Sun Yingsha, also from China, secured another all-China final after brushing aside Japan's Hina Hayata 4-0 in the other semi-final tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun won 11-6, 11-8, 11-8, 11-2, while not allowing the Japanese to take a lead in the last two games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed his six-day trip to Southeast Asia for allowing him to "meet new friends and strength past relationships", with a total of 55 non-binding deals signed with three countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "[We signed] twelve with Laos, 13 with Cambodia and 30 with Vietnam, covering a wide range of cooperative areas, such as trade and economic partnership, investment, customs collaboration, education, cultural exchanges and tourism promotion," he told reporters in Ho Chi Minh City on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have confirmed the support from the three countries' governments for Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an earlier luncheon with business leaders, Lee pledged to strengthen ties with Asean countries and reiterated his wish for Hong Kong to join the free trade pact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is making good use of the free trade agreement and investment agreement between Asean and Hong Kong to deepen our collaboration with Vietnam and other Asean countries. And we are eager to go beyond those free trade agreements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope, too, to join RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Through RCEP, I'm confident Hong Kong can make an even bigger contribution to the overall economic growth of Vietnam, Asean and the larger Asian region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Vietnamese politicians on his last day, including the chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Phan Van Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other visits included a trip to a Hong Kong-owned garment manufacturing factory, where the firm's chief executive officer was quoted as saying the company will continue to keep its headquarters in the SAR and attract talent from Asean countries to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR delegation was returning to Hong Kong on Friday evening.

<div class="itemFullText">
 It will be a guaranteed gold and silver for the national team as two Chinese pairs advanced to the final in the women’s doubles badminton event on Friday at La Chapelle Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first semi-final match, the pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan beat their Malaysian counterparts 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number one duo easily took the first game, 21-12, against Pearly Tan and Muralitharan Thinaah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Malaysians fought back 21-18 in the second, the first game the Chinese duo dropped in five matches throughout the tournament in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia then repeatedly targeted Tan, winning one point by directing multiple smashes at the Malaysian who managed a couple of acrobatic saves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese eventually prevailed and took the final game, 21-15, to book their place in the final. The two had won silver medals at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other match, Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning won in straight sets, after defeating Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida of Japan 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides fought aggressively in game one. The points were fairly equal until the national team pulled ahead to take it 21-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though the Japanese team managed to win a few points in the first half of the second game, the Chinese pair were able to widen the gap, ultimately winning 21-19.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day annual shopping festival kicked off on Friday at AsiaWorld-Expo, with organisers offering free admission to bargain hunters on opening day in celebration of Hong Kong's success at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, visitors and exhibitors at the Brands and Products Shopping Festival, organised by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, pointed to smaller crowds than usual at the fair that runs until August 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, featuring over 250 stalls, was expected to attract 60,000 visitors and generate some HK$60 million in sales revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ivan Sze, the association's vice-president, said he's not worried that sales would be affected by Hongkongers heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists being raised, we hope more mainland visitors will come to the festival to spend," Sze said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For Hongkongers heading north, dining accounts for a large proportion of their spending. But they may not buy too much across the border, because such consumption depends on the products themselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vendor surnamed Ng was selling sparkling wine at the fair and said there were several mainland tour groups visiting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were around 20 to 30 percent of visitors from the mainland. And with organisers offering free admissions, the number of people coming on the first day was about 20 to 30 percent more than last year's opening day," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would already be great for sales this year to match the previous year's levels... I hope the government can introduce more new promotional deals, or stimulate the retail sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor from the Netherlands, who gave his name as Hugo, said he did not see a lot of overseas visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy with the people who are there, but I hope there are more people in the weekend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Macau resident surnamed Lau came to Hong Kong just for the festival and spent around HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere was quite nice, and people were very friendly. The vendors were fair when doing business, and they were courteous," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tseung Kwan O resident surnamed Cheung said it took her two hours to travel from home to the event venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I did not have a voucher [for the festival], I might not have come... It seemed to have few people here. It's only the first day and there were only a handful of people," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An advocacy group on Friday called for more government support for people raising children with special educational needs (SEN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People Service Centre said a survey it carried out involving the caregivers of 175 children with special educational needs found almost 65 percent would like to be able to work, while 80 percent said existing employment support on offer was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social worker Zoe Lam said mothers caring for such children can find their responsibilities overwhelming, while a lack of flexibility in the workplace prevents them from getting a job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “One of our SEN caregivers, she tried to find [childcare] services but she experienced being rejected a number of times because her son was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia,” said Lam
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to 10 percent of the survey respondents said they had been denied childcare services because of their child's emotional or behavioural condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advocacy group called for more family-friendly employment policies, employment subsidies, employer incentives and the improvement of SEN childcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want these four recommendations to be put in the 2024 Policy Address, because now caregivers do not have the choice to choose between personal development and taking care of their families," Lam said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ada Chung says people should be wary of sharing photos and videos of themselves too widely due to a rise in deepfake scams.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers should avoid sharing photos or videos of themselves too widely to reduce the risk of scammers hijacking their images, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Chung said fraudsters are using technology to create deepfake images and videos to trick people into handing over money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong employees of two multinational companies have fallen victim to such scams this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If people really like sharing photos and videos of themselves, they should only share it with a specific audience group or privately. This will already make it much safer. They do not have to share it publicly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said her office received around 600 enquiries relating to fraud in the first six months of the year, up nearly 90 percent on the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said most involved phone scams, including cases where callers impersonated employees of various organisations to try to get people to give away personal information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencer Edgar Cheung returned to a hero's welcome from the Paris Games on Friday saying he still can't believe he managed to become the first athlete in decades to defend a men's foil title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who's also the first-ever SAR competitor to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals, was greeted by a crowd of fans as he arrived at the airport
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Never give up trying our best to give everything... because for me, it's what I train for, for the Olympics and every day I train hard to be in a good condition to fence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said his only regret from the Games was that the men’s foil team didn't qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said every SAR athlete gives their very best and they deserve respect regardless of whether they win a medal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he's going to have a big holiday before getting back to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We prepared for the Olympics for the past three years. It was hard, it was tough and physically, mentally, I'm quite tired. So for me now, I just want to have a good rest and to prepare for the next season,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having spent a lot of time in France, Cheung said he was craving Hong Kong cuisine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he had no plans yet on what to do with his HK$6 million prize money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on Italy's complaint and suggestions of bias over his victory against Filippo Macchi, Cheung said referees always follow fencing rules, even if they sometimes have different interpretations. He added that the referees in Paris were all professional and experienced.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index on Friday was down about 1.4 percent, or 240 points, in early trading at 17,064.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off came after Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday following weak manufacturing data, sparking worries about a US recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, European stocks had slumped on disappointing bank earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US indices finished decisively lower, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index falling the most at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets will get another key US economic data point on Friday with monthly jobs data. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For any Olympian, there's no shame in losing to the world's best player. There's even less shame when that player wasn't even born when you first competed at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But that's exactly the situation that 61-year-old table tennis player Ni Xialian found herself in in the women's singles in Paris. The Shanghai native, who represents her adopted country of Luxembourg, has been winning hearts as she proves that age is but a number ... even when it comes to playing a sport at the very highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni wrote herself into Olympic history as the oldest competitor to win a table tennis match when she beat Sibel Altinkaya of Turkey 4-2 in the round of 64 in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni, who won a mixed doubles world championship for China in her youth before moving to Europe, said she has already reached her goal of being able to compete at the Olympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Olympics has its own difficulties, but every time is exciting and a wonderful experience. For the technique part of the game, it depends on the draw," she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important. If you have some difficult draw, it's difficult. But of course, my age, you cannot against the nature. Every year getting more difficult, that's a fact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni's Olympic journey ended on Wednesday after being edged out by world number one Sun Yingsha of China, who is 38 years younger than her. Sun was born just a couple of months after Ni's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy to have this opportunity and not every day have such a chance, she's number one and people say I'm the only one, so I think it's a very happy, interesting game and we are showing Chinese table tennis [to] the world," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's such a strong, different generation and different area, and I hope I can offer a wonderful game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though Ni has completed her Olympic journey - at least until 2028 - she has won the hearts of many fans for her youthful spirit, becoming a social media hit after her inspiring performance at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people expressed their respect for her performance, while many others commented on the athlete's cuteness when she deployed spin to return her opponent’s shots.

 No medals for Hong Kong, China on Day 6 of the Olympic Games in Paris, although the SAR's athletes saw action in the pool and on the waves.

 Kate Douglass underlined her remarkable versatility with gold in the women's 200 metres breaststroke at the Paris Olympics on Thursday, beating Tokyo champion Tatjana Smith who bows out of a stellar swimming career with a silver medal in her final race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking full advantage of her turning prowess, American Douglass nudged ahead of Smith after every length and held off the South African to touch the wall in 2:19.24 at La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really excited. I feel like for a while I wasn't sure if Olympic champion was going to be possible for me to say, and now it's just really exciting to see it happen," Douglas told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Tes Schouten won bronze for the Netherlands, her first Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's finals, Hubert Kos took Hungary's first swimming gold of the Paris Olympics when he won the men's 200 metres backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Apostolos Christou took the silver and Switzerland's Roman Mityukov the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia rounded out the evening with victory in the women's 4x200 metres relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holders didn't have it all their own way though, as they were pushed hard in the first three legs by the US and defending champions China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, world record holder Ariarne Titmus anchored the Aussies to an Olympic-record winning gold while the US took silver and China the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US silver meant also that Katie Ledecky became the most decorated female swimmer of all time with 13 Olympic medals. (Agencies)

    Wall Street ends down on jitters over manufacturing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street initially opened stronger, but changed direction after manufacturing data raised concerns about the economy. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764341_1_20240802042650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks kicked off August sharply lower after a round of economic data on Thursday spurred concerns the economy may be slowing faster than anticipated while the Federal Reserve maintains a restrictive monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities initially opened higher, partly lifted by Meta Platforms after its quarterly results topped expectations and the Facebook parent issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the early gains evaporated after data showed a measure of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) dropped to an eight-month low in July at 46.8, signifying contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What you’re seeing now, and you will probably see it for the next month or two, is some kind of consolidation and sideways price action," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bigger picture bull trend is intact ... But we're in a period now where the market is kind of digesting its gains sideways, back and forth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 lost 75.62 points, or 1.4 percent, to end at 5,446.68, the Nasdaq Composite lost 405.26 points, or 2 .3 percent, to 17,194.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 494.82 points, or 1.2 percent, to 40,347.97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  August is typically one of the weakest months of the year for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other data showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labour market, although seasonal factors also played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will eye government payroll data later on Friday for signs of further weakness in the labour market. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Yufei came up short in her title defence of the 200m butterfly, coming back third while relinquishing her Olympic record to eventual champion Summer McIntosh of Canada.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang, who earlier took bronze in the 100m butterfly, was in the chase at the halfway mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But McIntosh powered into a decisive lead by the final turn of the pool, while American Regan Smith also caught up with Zhang down the stretch to clinch silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh touched the wall after two minutes and 3.03 seconds, smashing the previous record set in Tokyo by more than eight-tenths of a second. Zhang came back over two seconds later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Jiangsu native has one more shot at gold in the 50m freestyle, which starts on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday evening, China added a bronze in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Junxuan and Li Bingjie, who were part of the quartet who struck gold in Tokyo, were joined by Ge Chutong and Liu Yaxin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finished at just over seven minutes and 42 seconds, around four seconds behind winners Australia, while the United States took silver.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong scraped through to the men's singles semi-final after a pulsating contest against Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who bagged silver in Tokyo, erased a two-game deficit before outlasting his opponent 4-3 in 68 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was a major relief for Chinese fans, after top seed Wang Chuqin suffered a shock exit in the round of 32 yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan's defeat would be a huge disappointment for China, as they have finished on the podium of the men's singles in every Games since 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I didn't perform particularly well today, and allowed my opponent to dictate the rhythm," Fan told RTHK after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to break through, and kept my confidence. Eventually I found a way while keeping the score close, and waited for the momentum to shift."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will next take on 17-year-old French prodigy Felix Lebrun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Sun Yingsha reached the last four in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed has not dropped a single game so far in Paris, going 16-0 following her latest victory over Chinese Taipei's Cheng I-ching in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, who already bagged a gold in the mixed doubles, will next face Hina Hayata of Japan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles clinched her sixth Olympic gold medal in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Paris Games on Thursday, reasserting her status as the number one all-around gymnast three years after she withdrew from the same final at the Tokyo Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight race between Biles and Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, the American was surprisingly left trailing in third place after a flawed performance on the uneven bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she was back on top after a solid performance on her next apparatus - the balance beam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she waited to perform last on the floor, she knew the gold would be hers if she avoided any unexpected slip ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She executed an electrifying routine to secure the gold with a total of 59.131 points, just 1.199 points ahead of her Brazilian rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrade earned a second successive silver in the competition where each gymnasts needs to show off their skills on all four women's apparatus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles' teammate Sunisa Lee, the Tokyo all-around champion, fought back from a disappointing start on the vault to claim thee bronze with 56.465 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles captured her second gold medal of the Paris Games, and her second all-around Olympic title after also winning the individual event in Rio in 2016. She also claimed the team gold earlier this week. (Reuters)

    UK central bank eases rates as inflation ebbs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Governor Andrew Bailey joined four other policymakers in bringing the rate down from a 16-year high.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate for the first time since the pandemic broke out in 2020, as British inflation has retreated in recent months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight 5-4 vote, BoE policymakers agreed to reduce borrowing costs by a quarter-point to 5.0 percent, the central bank announced following a regular meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Andrew Bailey joined four other policymakers in bringing the rate down from a 16-year high, which will ease pressure on borrowers while denting interest earned by savers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail banks tend to mirror the direction of BoE policy when setting their own interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inflationary pressures have eased enough that we've been able to cut interest rates," Bailey said in a short statement. "But we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's annual inflation rate has returned to the BoE target of two percent, after soaring to a four-decade high above 11 percent in late 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its key lending rate unchanged, but noted "some further progress" had been made in bringing inflation down. It is expected to cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the BoE's action Thursday, analysts said they expected the British central bank to cut again this year, but maybe not as early as next month. That helped the pound claw back earlier losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, the European Central Bank has started to trim rates as gains to prices of global goods and services have largely slowed in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday hiked borrowing costs for only the second time in 17 years amid a pickup in the country's inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's rate cut comes less than one month after the country elected a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour administration has vowed to grow the UK economy but has already warned that state spending will be hampered by tight finances. (AFP)

 <br>
  <br/>
  Last month was "the hottest July since complete observations began in 1961, and the hottest single month in the history of observation", state broadcaster CCTV said, citing weather authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average air temperature in China last month was 23.21 degrees Celsius (73.78 degrees Fahrenheit), exceeding the previous record of 23.17 C in 2017, CCTV reported the weather authorities as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mean temperature in every province was also "higher than the average for previous years", with the southwestern provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan logging their highest ever averages, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has experienced by extreme weather this summer, with heat waves scorching parts of the north while torrential rains have triggered floods and landslides in central and southern areas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma have both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng entered the day ranked ninth overall out of 24 men's entrants, having won a race yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two remaining races were scrapped, meaning the 24-year-old had no chance to make up lost ground. Only the top 10 surfers would reach the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma, on the other hand, fell two places to finish 14th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was disqualified on the first race on Thursday, and placed 15th and 10th in the ensuing two. Like the men's competition, the two final women's races were cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday has a lot of catching up to do after the opening day of dinghy competition in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Olympic debutante is placed 28th out of 43 after two races, with eight still to come over the coming four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner for each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday is now on 49 points, compared with 27 for Jean-Baptiste Bernaz of France in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy's Lorenzo Musetti knocked defending champion Alexander Zverev out of the Olympic Games tennis tournament on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Musetti triumphed 7-5, 7-5 over the German world number four in the quarter-finals and will face either top seed Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz of Spain stormed into the semi-finals with an imperious display of tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, playing on the same Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros where he captured the French Open in June, saw off 13th-ranked Tommy Paul of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz recovered from a break down in the second set to defeat Paul, having also beaten the American in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on his way to the title at the All England Club last month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan are expected to be released by Russia as part of one of the biggest East-West prisoner swaps since the Cold War, according to US media on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CNN and other US networks reported the news, with ABC News reporting that the swap involved numerous countries and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate confirmation from US officials. The Kremlin declined to comment on any exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still have no comment on this topic," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March 2023 and convicted in July on spying charges in a fast-track trial denounced as a sham by the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of an imminent prisoner swap had picked up momentum on Thursday, amid reports a plane used in a previous exchange deal had landed in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopes had also risen in recent days days after a number of high-profile prisoners in Russia, including Whelan, went missing from prisons where they were serving long terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those expected to be returned to Russia in exchange is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian citizen imprisoned in Germany for killing a former Chechen rebel commander in a brazen assassination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exchange would be a victory for US President Joe Biden, whose vice president, Kamala Harris, faces Republican Donald Trump in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would be the first prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since star US basketball player Brittney Griner was swapped in return for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen of China stunned women's world number one Iga Swiatek on Thursday to become the first player from the nation to reach an Olympic Games tennis singles final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventh-ranked Zheng triumphed 6-2, 7-5 and will face either Croatia's Donna Vekic or Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel more than just happy – happy isn't enough to describe how I feel," said Zheng, who had played back-to-back three-hour matches to make the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you ask me to play another three hours for my country, I would. It was an amazing match. To beat Iga is not easy, as it's an important event for her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion at Roland Garros, went into Thursday's match at a sweltering Court Philippe Chatrier on a 25-match win streak in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old had defeated Zheng in all of their six previous meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the mixed doubles, the Chinese pair of Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen reached the final after defeating their opponents from the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Zhang were slow off the block in the semi-final, conceding the opening set 2-6 to Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese pair levelled the match at one set apiece by winning set two 6-4, before clinching the tie-break 10-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will face the winner of the other semi-final between the pairs from Canada and the Czech Republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final is scheduled on Saturday morning, Hong Kong time at Roland Garros. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department on Thursday said it conducted around 6,900 checks at about 700 old residential and commercial buildings as of the end of last month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said inspections were stepped up after a fatal fire in a Jordan residential block in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Fire Officer Michael Yung said the common hazards identified during the inspections included defective smoke-stop doors and obstructed escape routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the department will take legal action against those who ignore warning notices and fail to carry out improvement works.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For these inspections, we have issued about [5,000] fire hazard abatement notices, and we will likely take legal action against 264 offences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung added the department aims to inspect 1,000 high-risk old buildings by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the department prosecuted over 1,000 cases for non-compliance to fire safety directions in the first half of the year, a threefold increase compared to the previous year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Hong Kong swimmers on Thursday failed to make it out of the heats at Paris La Defense Arena, bringing their Olympic journeys to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cindy Cheung, the youngest member to represent the SAR in swimming, competed in the women’s 200m backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old maintained a steady pace in her heat against two others, finishing in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She clocked 2 minutes 17.32 seconds, more than 4 seconds behind the winner Tatiana Salcutan of Moldova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who came 26th overall among 27 swimmers, said she was not happy with her performance but that her experience in Paris had been invaluable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the end, this was a very good learning experience. I got to see how the Olympic Village was like, and experienced what it was like to compete at such a high level – the feeling is very different," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though my finishing time was not up to my expectations, this was an experience that's hard to come by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men’s side, Ian Ho also concluded his second Olympics in the pool after he failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the men’s 50m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old came last in his heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really can’t complain. It’s been a good Olympics for me, and to have such a different experience from last time...Really, I’m grateful for what I’ve been able to do," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and Ho were eliminated from the women’s 100m backstroke and the men’s 100m freestyle earlier.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 9.7 percent to HK$29.9 billion in June, government data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, total retail sales were down 6.6 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman attributed the decline to changing consumer behaviour among both visitors and residents, as well as the strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said the rate of decline narrowed further in June, signalling a stabilisation in retail activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the spokesman pointed to ongoing challenges for the sector in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said central government initiatives benefiting Hong Kong and the SAR government's efforts to support the retail sector through mega-events would help retailers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An alert that warns people using the Faster Payment System (FPS) they could be about to lose money to fraudsters is being extended to transactions made in banks or via online banking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From August 4, bank customers will receive an alert if they are on the verge of making a transfer to a recipient flagged as high-risk by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Chu, executive director in banking supervision at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said the extended alert system will offer people more protection from scammers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After this expansion, the coverage of bank transfer transactions will increase from 35 percent to 84 percent. It basically has a wide coverage of the fund transfer transactions, and it will enhance the protection to customers to send the high-risk alerts to them to warn them before they execute a transaction," Chu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Lam from the police's Cyber Security and Technology Bureau said the fraud alert system has been effective since its launch in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of the end of June this year, our system has issued more than 650,000 high-risk alerts. That is an average of one warning for every 30 seconds, which is effectively reminding people of the risk of a scam," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Projected from the average loss of about HK$1,500 per each scam case, and we anticipate the high-risk alert has so far issued a warning of scams [involving] nearly HK$1 billion."

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has encouraged Hong Kong entrepreneurs to better integrate into national reform and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also called on them to contribute further to Chinese modernisation by giving full play to their strengths, in a letter to representatives of Hong Kong entrepreneurs with roots in Ningbo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, descendants of Ningbo-born Hong Kong entrepreneurs wrote to Xi to report on their efforts to support national development and express their commitment to the country's modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the reply letter, the president spoke highly of their tradition of patriotism and contributions to the development of their hometown and the country through active engagement in innovation and entrepreneurship and donations to education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Efforts to build a great country and move towards national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernisation requires the concerted efforts of all Chinese people, Xi added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee thanked President Xi for his response to the entrepreneurs, saying that Xi's letter encourages them to contribute to national development. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers from Chinese University on Thursday called for the implementation of a proactive screening and prevention strategy to tackle the serious pregnancy complication pre-eclampsia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pre-eclampsia, a condition that typically manifests after 20 weeks of pregnancy, is characterised by high blood pressure, elevated urine protein levels indicating kidney damage, and other signs of organ dysfunction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said pregnant women should be screened for pre-eclampsia, with those at risk given low-doses of aspirin as a preventative measure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said their recommendation follows a study conducted with partners across Asia which showed the effectiveness of such a preventative approach, with the practice already established in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the strategy can significantly cut the incidence of pre-eclampsia by between 41 and 54 percent, as well as reducing premature births and perinatal deaths by more than 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liona Poon, professor of obstetrics at the university, highlighted the critical nature of the condition, saying it poses a serious threat to both mother and baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the worst case scenario, the woman can present with seizures and this is what we are very worried about... It's a life-threatening condition for herself as well as her unborn child," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So why do we recommend early screening? It's because there is strong evidence suggesting that there is a way of preventing pre-eclampsia and that is giving high-risk women aspirin. Aspirin should be started before 16 weeks of gestation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university's study involved nearly 43,000 pregnant women in Hong Kong and nine other places in Asia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said Vietnam's rapid economic growth offers lucrative business opportunities for Hong Kong enterprises.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee's comment came as Hong Kong signed eight memoranda of understanding with Vietnam, covering areas such as aviation development, investment and commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the day, the CE met Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Luu Quang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During their discussions, Lee said that Hong Kong serves as an ideal hub for Vietnam to expand its presence in overseas markets, being as it offers exceptional financial, legal and professional services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Tran said the talks focused on strengthening trade and cooperation between the two places, noting Hong Kong's substantial investments in Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the afternoon, Lee met Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Xiong Bo at the embassy in Hanoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xiong said the SAR has transitioned from stability to prosperity, under Lee's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ambassador also affirmed the central government's support for Hong Kong's Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) bid, as well as its participation in Sino-Asean cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE's visit to Vietnam is the final leg of a six-day trip in Southeast Asia.

    HK green group urges action on coral bleaching

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 WWF-Hong Kong on Thursday urged the government to designate 30 percent of the SAR's waters as marine protected areas by 2030.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call comes after the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department received reports of coral bleaching in Hong Kong waters last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bleaching strips coral of its main source of energy, and the coral's demise weakens the overall ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelvin So, WWF-Hong Kong's Oceans Conservation Manager, said the main cause of bleaching is a rise in water temperature. It can also be caused by heavy rainfall, which carries sediments from land that can degrade water quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So urged the government to collaborate with universities to study coral bleaching in Hong Kong's waters and to take step to better protect them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to identify and designate ecologically sensitive area for corals such as Sharp Island and Shelter Island in Sai Kung, and establish legally binding regulations to protect these critical areas from human activities," he said.

    New rules on feeding wild animals take effect

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ban on feeding wild animals now also covers feral pigeons. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764231_1_20240801132929.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law took effect on Thursday, with lawmakers urging the authorities to make sure tourists are aware of rules banning the feeding of wild animals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by Legco in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Offenders may be hit with a fixed penalty of HK$5,000, with the ban now also covering the feeding of feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers, district councillors and officials, including Undersecretary for Environment and Ecology Diane Wong and Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Mickey Lai, went to Tseung Kwan O on Thursday to publicise the new rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, DAB lawmaker Stanley Li said he is concerned that tourists will not be aware of the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because they may be permitted to feed feral pigeons in the countries or places they come from. But this is banned in Hong Kong. As I mentioned in the bills committee, the government needs to enhance promotion and place clear signs at border points,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also noted that appointed officers from certain government departments, and not just the police and Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), can now enforce the law even in private venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the authorities to provide training to these departments to avoid disputes or confusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sai Kung district councillor Angel Chong said she believes the new measures have a deterrent effect and will effectively reduce the number of pigeons in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The feeding of pigeons caused a lot of environmental issues back here and a lot of people actually fed them back then, but then we couldn't prosecute them,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But now feeding wild animals and especially pigeons is illegal. I think that actually reduces the incentive of feeding pigeons a lot because now they'd be afraid of being fined. So I think the environmental and health issues caused by feeding pigeons will improve.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD said that for a month, verbal warnings will be given before enforcement action, to allow people to adapt to the new rules.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will actively expand domestic demand and put consumption promotion at a more prominent position in the next step, Yuan Da, a senior official with the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The state planner will launch efforts to boost consumption of major commodities such as automobiles and home appliances, and to improve and expand the quality and capacity of service consumption in education, elderly care, child care and domestic services, Yuan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support will be given to the high-quality development of cultural and sports tourism, Yuan said, adding that measures will be optimised to make travel in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also expressed confidence that China will achieve its full-year economic growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "sufficient" room for counter-cyclical policy adjustments, said Zhao Chenxin, vice head of the state planner. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday kept its base rate at 5.75 percent, after the US Federal Reserve ended a two-day meeting leaving its key rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the first interest rate cut could come as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said “inflation pressure in the US has somewhat abated lately, and the market expects that the easing cycle might begin soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it added that the pace of any easing remains uncertain, and said the interbank offered rate in Hong Kong might stay high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said in a statement.

 Fencing queen Vivian Kong made a triumphant return to Hong Kong on Thursday, days after winning the SAR's first gold of the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made a sensational comeback in the women's epee gold medal match, overcoming a deficit of 1-7 at one point to beat French rival Auriane Mallo-Breton 13-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she was moved by the show of support from the many fans who gathered for her arrival at Hong Kong airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong's home. It's so good to be home. And being in Paris, I love the French people, with my French friend in the finals. But they had a huge crowd supporting her, and coming back it feels like I have my crowd too,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she had missed her father and wanted to meet up with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about her future plans, she said she was still savouring her victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It still feels unreal. It still feels like I have to go train, but I don't have to today, so I think I'm going to try and let this sink in and then decide what's next.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong also paid tribute to SAR athletes of previous generations, saying they achieved remarkable results with far fewer resources, paving the way for the current crop to pursue their dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she plans to use some of her HK$6 million prize money to buy gifts for her team and coach, adding that she would like to set up a fund to help provide fencing equipment for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said her aim is not only to promote fencing, but also to inspire others to discover and pursue their own passions in athletics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) called for community support for breastfeeding mothers as World Breastfeeding Awareness Week began on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leung Wing-cheong, a consultant obstetrician at Kwong Wah Hospital, said the authority has introduced various initiatives to promote breastfeeding, including lactation consultant clinics to address the concerns of mothers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said additional support includes antenatal education programmes and a dedicated helpline to assist women with breastfeeding challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that an important step forward will be the establishment of a breast milk bank, which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of next year. The bank is expected to collect 1,000 litres of breast milk per year, benefiting up to 600 premature babies, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said that breast milk is the most natural food for babies, highlighting the long-term benefits of breastfeeding in reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems in babies, as well as promoting neurological development in infants. He added that it also helps recovery after pregnancy and reduces the risk of breast cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that successful breastfeeding is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will be ideal if they have enough support from their partner, husband, in-laws, parents etc. I think successful breastfeeding is indeed teamwork, not just the mother on her own," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday rejected accusations in a Forbes Magazine article that suggested that Hong Kong was being used as a hub by "rogue regimes" to conduct "illicit financial transactions and evade international sanctions."
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government hit out at the Forbes commentary, claiming it cited "false and unfounded narratives" from an anti-China group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the SAR is part of China and that UN Security Council sanctions had always been imposed in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without naming names, it said certain countries might impose unilateral sanctions against some places on the basis of their own considerations but that the SAR government did not have the legal authority to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said thanks to local law enforcement agencies, a number of suspected Hong Kong-registered companies had been struck off, and suspicious vessels had been denied entry into Hong Kong waters as part of its robust system to implement sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cedric Ho recalls having doubts about his career. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764124_2_20240731231321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencers Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho said they're aiming higher after making their Olympic debuts in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both hope to continue to shine in the sport thanks to the spirit of never giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan bowed out of the women’s foil individual event after she was beaten by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16. Still, it's the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old recalled enjoying every moment on the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I was just focusing on the skills or tactics, what I want to do and just try my very best to score. And even though I know at the very end the gap was quite big, I didn't give up. Actually in my mind, I just want to try all my stuff and I just want to do my best," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said fellow fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung’s triumphs motivated her and other young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was amazing because my competition day was in the middle. So like before my competition day I saw Vivian got the gold medal… They brought home two gold medals which is never easy, and I think a lot of citizens will know fencing this sport and I think more and more kids will be joining this sport as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a part-time fencer who’s studying in the United States, Chan said it was difficult to juggle between fencing and her studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she made it clear she didn’t want to give up the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho, meanwhile, recalled being at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The idea of giving up came up most when I was at my lowest point, which was about two or three years after the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. I was a bit down and confused and kind of wanted to give up, but luckily I got through in the end,” the 28-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho is the first male épéeist from the SAR to qualify for the Olympics in 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to Japan's Masaru Yamada in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This proves that we have worked very hard in the men's épée category for the past 12 years. The success of our men's épée is due to the whole team and the coaches working together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said he's proud of Ho’s performance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel that he has a lot of takeaways. He's seen his potential, his strengths, and he also has seen his room for improvement. And I hope that we can keep on growing together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu added he's confident that fencing will continue to develop in Hong Kong because of government support and infrastructure being put in place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index fell 16.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to open at 17,327.85 points on Thursday, following its 2 percent rise on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates could be cut as soon as September if the US economy follows its expected path, putting the central bank near the end of a more than two-year battle against inflation. The Fed ended its latest two-day policy meeting with a decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25-5.50 percent range that was set a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it was keeping its base rate at 5.75 percent.

         Hong Kong table tennis player Zhu Chengzhu bowed out of the women's singles, losing 0-4 in her round of 32 match against Japan's Miu Hirano.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes. But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.

          The SAR's Wong Chun-ting put up a good fight in his round-of-32 men's table tennis singles match, but he was no match for second-seeded Fan Zhendong of China.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Fan simply proved too strong for his Hong Kong, China opponent. He completed a 4-1 win in 36 minutes. Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet were the last shuttlers from Hong Kong to bow out of the Paris Olympics, as they shared an emotional moment following defeat in the mixed doubles quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The long-time partners on the court were brushed aside in straight games by the third-seeded pair of Chae Yu-jung and Seo Seung-jae.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans needed just 39 minutes to finish off the SAR duo, winning 21-15, 21-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang and Tse went down by as much as 9-16 in the opening game, before taking five of the next seven points to go within 14-18. They never got closer than that, however, and the Koreans hung on to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chae and Seo then asserted control of game two with an 8-1 run, and never relinquished the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Tang and Tse had trouble holding back tears while meeting the press afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse, who said she's grateful just to compete in Paris, revealed for the first time that she was in a hospital emergency ward two or three weeks ago but did not specify the reason.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Perhaps in the past month, I've cried every single day while on the court. Jordan withstood a lot from me," Tse said as she briefly lost her composure in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I couldn't even squeeze a toothpaste... or comb my hair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also heaped praise on Tang, saying without him she might have retired a long time ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, for his part, thanked Tse for not giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also picked up bumps and bruises here and there so I understand how difficult it is... Returning to a high level after injury is never easy, yet she's done it many times."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added they've been under immense pressure in the past year or so punching their Paris tickets, as they had trailed so much in the rankings.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's new swimming prodigy Pan Zhanle smashed his own world record as he destroyed the field to clinch a gold medal in men's 100m freestyle at the Olympics early on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pan, four days from his 20th birthday, finished the course in 46.40 seconds, 0.4 seconds faster than the mark he set in February in Doha at the World Aquatics Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Kyle Chalmers, more than a full second behind Pan, took silver, while Romanian David Popovici got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan's superb performance won Team China their 9th gold medal at the Paris Games and their first in the pool. It was also the first swimming world record of this year's Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could cut interest rates as soon as September, with technology shares leading the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Fed delivered what the markets anticipated in terms of opening the door to a rate cut in September without overcommitting," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major US indices spent almost the entire day in positive territory, hitting peaks during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference before edging down a bit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index led major indices, winning 2.6 percent to finish at 17,599.40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 percent to 40,842.79, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.6 percent to 5,522.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain interest rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Powell told a news conference that the first interest rate cut could come "as soon as" the Fed's next rate meeting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is beginning to feel more comfortable that inflation is beginning to come down," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Capital. "The Fed feels that it can finally get control of inflation, there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductor shares enjoyed a buoyant session, with artificial intelligence player Nvidia rocketing up 12.8 percent and Broadcom and Micron also advancing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing gained 2.1 percent despite reporting a bigger than expected loss as the troubled aviation company named Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO. The appointment won praise from analysts who said Ortberg's extensive aerospace experience would bolster a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft fell 1.1 percent despite reporting a 10 percent jump in quarterly profit to US$22 billion. Analysts said a crucial cloud computing unit did not grow as strongly as expected. (AFP)

    Trump queries whether Kamala Harris is really black

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Donald Trump has accused his Democratic rival of happening to "turn black". Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764147_1_20240801033646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has questioned whether Democrat Kamala Harris is really black or is using race as a political convenience in an interview that sent shockwaves through the 2024 presidential contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black," Trump told a panel of interviewers at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And now she wants to be known as black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?" he said of Harris, who is the first black, female, and South-Asian-heritage vice president in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I respect either one but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn, and she became a black person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The provocative comments by the Republican presidential nominee were the latest in a stream of ratcheted up personal attacks by the 78-year-old on Harris, and follow his multiple remarks this week in which he accused Harris -- who is married to a Jewish-American -- of being anti-Semitic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden's White House swiftly responded to Trump's comments, calling them "insulting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the first black woman to hold the position, told reporters. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey snagged another bronze medal on Thursday in the women’s 100 metres freestyle event in Paris, making her the first Hongkonger to clinch four Olympic medals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey stayed around the front of the pack throughout the first 50 metres, and was able to pull herself into second place behind the fast-starting American Torri Huske at the turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pushed through the last 50 metres and was in contention thoughout to grab a spot on the podium with a time of 52.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s world record holder Sarah Sjoestroem surged through to claim the gold with a time of 52.16 seconds, while Huske was 0.13 seconds back to pip Haughey for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters that she knew it would be a highly competitive race, so she just wanted to focus on enjoying the whole process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that my training for this race in the past few years was more intense compared to the Tokyo Olympics. I practised a lot more in terms of training time, number of minutes, and distance. Especially as you get older, your body recovery is getting worse," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children watching TV, everyone needs to add oil (keep going). The whole journey may not be easy, but if you have a dream, just keep chasing it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey earlier won the bronze in the 200 metres freestyle event, as well as two silver medals at the Tokyo Olympics in the same respective events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sjoestroem, who set the world record back in 2017, had only committed to join the 100 metres at the last minute having previously indicated she'd focus on her favoured 50m free.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese gymnasts suffered another blow at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Thursday, after Japan's Oka Shinnosuke secured gold following a neck-and-neck battle in the men's individual all-round discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka and the Chinese pair of Xiao Ruoteng and Zhang Boheng were leading the pack after completing five of the six routines, with less than 0.37 points separating the trio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang went last on the last routine - the horizontal bar - and needed 14.9 points to seal victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But minor flaws in his performance meant he ended up 0.2 points short, handing victory to Oka who reigned supreme with a final score of 86.832. Xiao rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan have now won the event four consecutive times, but their defence did not come easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang stumbled out of the gate in the floor exercise, with his score of 13.233 points being one of the worst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he recovered since, even rising to medal contention with a strong 15.3 points on the parallel bars in the fifth round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang and Xiao were part of the Chinese group who coughed up the gold medal in the team event on Monday. Their teammate Su Weide fell twice from the bar in the final routine, enabling a dramatic comeback by Japan to snatch gold from China's hands.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve left its key lending rate unchanged again on Wednesday and said it had made "some further progress" in its inflation fight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the US central bank's benchmark interest rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement -- keeping rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a small uptick in inflation earlier this year, recent data suggest the Fed's mission of bringing inflation back down to its long-term target of 2 percent is now firmly back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its favoured measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labour market has come into better balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective," the Fed said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks a slight change in tone from its decision in June, when it noted only that "modest further progress" had been made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance," the Fed said, adding that it was "attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But since then, the official figures have painted a better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 60 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cuts are expected to come in the form of three separate quarter-point moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favouritism towards the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen on Wednesday became only the second Chinese tennis player to reach the singles semi-finals at an Olympics, beating German veteran Angelique Kerber 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(6) in the quarter-finals in a three-set thriller.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two tough sets, Kerber, who won a silver medal at Rio 2016, took the lead in the third to 4-1 and received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic French crowd after saving a huge break point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having run out of steam on a hot and humid Philippe Chatrier court and lost 10 points in a row, she bounced back to 4-4. But Zheng's powerful shots allowed her to win the tiebreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the quarter-finals, at a tournament the 36-year-old had said would be her last, was the former world number one's best performance this year after returning from maternity leave in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German had lost in the first round of this year's three Grand Slams so far, the Australian and French Open followed by Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng reached a career-high ranking of No. 7 after her runner-up finish at the Australian Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men's side, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz shrugged off crushing humidityto stay on course for an Olympic gold medal showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, seeking a first Olympic title at Roland Garros to add to his record-breaking collection, defeated German left-hander Dominik Koepfer 7-5, 6-3, becoming the first man to reach four singles quarter-finals at the Games.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu concluded his maiden Olympic campaign on Wednesday after losing to old rival Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei in their group stage finale.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was sent packing after 12th-seeded Chou wrapped up a 21-18, 21-13 victory in 44 minutes to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 17 Lee, who was beaten by Chou in eight of their 12 previous matchups, mostly played catch-up in their latest encounter. The SAR shuttler came back from six points down in the opening game to make it 18-19, before his opponent delivered perfect smashes to take the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chou once again moved in front in the ensuing game with a 12-6 lead, and Lee failed to erase the deficit the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the press after the match, Lee said he felt he could have done better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather up and down emotionally... I give myself too much pressure, I wanted to prove myself to others," he conceded, holding back tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before arriving [in Paris], I told my coaches, this is my only chance to prove to the world who Lee Cheuk-yiu is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to address his weaknesses and consistency issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the La Chapelle Arena in Paris, Chinese Taipei veteran Tai Tzu-ying suffered a shock group stage exit in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three, who bagged silver in Tokyo, was stunned by Ratchanok Intanon from Thailand in straight games, 19-21, 15-21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai, who was battling multiple injuries, burst into tears after the match and shared a warm embrace with her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did my best, based on my condition at this year's Games," a tearful Tai told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I can say that I have tried my best. But of course, speed-wise I was unable to catch up to my opponent."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Alex Cheng has notched his maiden race victory in the men's windsurfing competition off Marseille.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The win on his seventh attempt propelled Cheng to 11th overall among 24 entrants. He climbed another two places to ninth after coming back seventh, 10th and fifth respectively in the next three races on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five remaining races are scheduled for Thursday afternoon, local time. Only the top 10 boats in the 15-race opening series will advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng's SAR teammate, Mui Ma, dropped one place to 12th overall after another four races on Wednesday in the women's iQFOiL event. The 26-year-old started strong, finishing seventh on race eight, but her performance tapered off as the day progressed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In sailing, Hong Kong's Akira Sakai and Russell Alysworth remain last out of 20 teams following the penultimate race in the men's skiff category. Only the top 10 boats will enter the medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Nautical Stadium in Vaires-sur-Marne, east of Paris, SAR rower Chiu Hin-chun finished fifth in the six-strong semi-final of the singles skulls with a time of seven minutes, 3.68 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will wrap up his Olympic campaign on Thursday with a ranking race determining the 19th to 24th places.

    Boeing names new boss, unveils hefty loss

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing named former Rockwell Collins chief Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO on Wednesday, as the planemaker reported a loss on continued operational problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ortberg, 64, helped lead Rockwell Collins and integrate it into United Technology prior to his retirement from RTX in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment comes as Boeing attempts to rebound from a series of safety and quality control problems that have sharpened scrutiny on the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg "is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry," said Boeing chairman Steve Mollenkopf in a message to employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg is set to become CEO on August 8, taking over for Dave Calhoun, a former General Electric and private equity executive who has held the post since early 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Kelly as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in our long history," Mollenkopf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing on Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of US$1.4 billion, compared with a loss of US$149 million in the year-ago period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenues fell 14.6 percent to US$16.9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterly results reflected a continued drag from Boeing's commercial division, where it has lowered production while addressing safety and quality control issues under the close watch of regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has been in the hot seat since a January incident in which a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest results also showed significant weakness in its defence business due to a number of fixed price contracts where it has experienced deep losses due to supply chain problems, as well as higher engineering costs and technical issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's press release listed four defence contracts behind an operating loss of US$913 million in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations," Calhoun said. "We are making important progress in our recovery and will continue to build trust through action and transparency." (AFP)

    Warnings before enforcement over illegal feeding

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ban on illegal feeding will be extended to cover feral pigeons. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764115_1_20240731223353.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said verbal warnings will be given before enforcement action for a month after an amendment to the city’s wildlife protection law takes effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Legislative Council passed the Wild Animals Protection (Amendment) Bill in May, raising the maximum penalty of feeding wild animals to HK$100,000 and a one-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be a fixed penalty of HK$5,000 for illegal feeding, and the ban will be extended to cover feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new law takes effect on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Wednesday that officers will issue verbal warnings before taking enforcement actions when they find any illegal feeding activity from August 1 to 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Starting from September 1, enforcement officers will take enforcement action immediately without prior verbal warning if any person is found to be illegally feeding feral pigeons or wild animals,” it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the police and AFCD officers, appointed officers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and Housing Department can also take enforcement action against illegal feeding, the AFCD noted.
