    Boeing's space capsule springs more helium leaks

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing’s space capsule developed more leaks during its first test flight with astronauts as it closed in on the International Space Station on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Starliner capsule already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit on Wednesday. Boeing and Nasa managers were confident they could manage the propulsion system despite the problem and that more leaks were unlikely. But just hours into the flight, two more leaks cropped up. There was no immediate word on the size of these new leaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaks pose no safety issues for Nasa test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams or the mission, Boeing spokesman Jim May said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mission managers pressed ahead for a midday docking with the space station while continuing to monitor the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  May said the capsule holds plenty of helium reserves to make up for what's lost. The propulsion system will be disabled once the capsule is docked at the space station since the thrusters will not be needed then, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helium is used to pressurise the fuel lines of Starliner’s thrusters, which are essential for manoeuvering. Before liftoff, engineers devised a plan to work around any additional leaks in the system. A faulty rubber seal, no bigger than a shirt button, is believed responsible for the original leak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the space shuttles retired, Nasa hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX’s taxi service began in 2020. Boeing was supposed to start around the same time, but was held up for years by safety concerns and other troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing plans to keep Starliner at the space station for at least eight days before guiding it to a landing in the western US. (AP)

    Starship rocket splashes down in Indian Ocean

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The SpaceX Starship launching on its fourth flight test from Starbase in Texas. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756404_1_20240606223852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's giant Starship rocket survived reentry through Earth's atmosphere on Thursday and splashed down in the Indian Ocean as planned during its fourth test mission after launching from south Texas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-stage spacecraft, consisting of the Starship cruise vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, broke apart during its last attempt in March to survive a blazingly hot reentry through Earth's atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the craft survived its reentry on Thursday, a SpaceX livestream showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on social media after the splashdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starship, stacked atop its Super Heavy booster, blasted off on Thursday morning from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas. It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of kilometres above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Super Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There, it began its free-fall back to Earth where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric reentry – the crucial point at which it failed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Designed to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship – standing nearly 122 metres tall – represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by Nasa in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 40 kilometres above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating," Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by Nasa as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programmes, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon cancelled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and opposed the House of Representatives of the United States Congress for introducing a resolution which it said “smeared and slandered” the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance as well as law enforcement actions taken by HKSAR law enforcement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR administration said, "The US House of Representatives grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China, violating international law and the basic norms governing international relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR will not be intimidated and will continue to resolutely safeguard national security in accordance with the law," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also said the US was "in no position to point its finger" at the SAR for legitimately passing legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the SAR's legal framework in safeguarding national security was in line with international human rights standards, and the extraterritorial effect for the offences endangering national security also fully aligns with the principles of international law.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Thursday said it planned to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the government consulted the sector last month and received positive feedback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It planned to invite red minibus route operators, who had already joined the HK$2 fare scheme, to switch to green routes, to further ensure the quality of minibus services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said about 70 red minibus routes had joined the fare scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said criteria would be set for those who wished to go green, such as requiring minibus routes to operate for at least five years, have only one fixed route and offer whole-day services, and the route must be run by only one operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes within the month of July, and the department said it would ensure all routes meet the conditions for operating public light buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, red minibuses are allowed to operate across the territory, and their routes, frequency and fares are not subject to any restrictions.

    CE urged to step in to end HKU appointment conflict

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former council members and alumni of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have called on Chief Executive John Lee to put an end to the infighting at the institution, saying they had lost faith in the council's chairperson Priscilla Wong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They wrote a letter to Lee, who is also the university's chancellor, saying the council had appointed several interim vice-presidents without consulting HKU president and vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the council is tasked with giving advice and monitoring HKU's management, but does not directly deal with administrative affairs, adding the body's move had sparked conflicts in HKU and affected its normal operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Lee to step in promptly, or people would have the impression the government had appointed the council chairperson to control HKU and sideline the president, which would harm Hong Kong's international image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the letter's signatories, former executive councillor Fanny Law, told RTHK she "doesn't have an opinion on who should be the vice-presidents," but she cared about the procedures, HKU's reputation and the city's image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party legislator Regina Ip, who sits on HKU's court, an overseeing and legislative body comprising university and lay members, said she hopes the conflict can be settled soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally I think vice-presidents are part of the president's team. No matter who has the power to appoint them, they should consult the president thoroughly. It's better if the president gets along with the vice-presidents and they can work together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Chief Executive's Office said Lee had asked the Education Bureau to comprehend the situation before reporting to him, adding that people would expect HKU, a successful university, to have good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang had earlier criticised the council's action in an email to HKU teaching staff and students, saying it violated established procedures and severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".

<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders on Thursday gathered in Normandy to remember those who fought and died on the beaches of northern France 80 years ago, when Allied forces launched "D-Day" to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Moving letters from veterans were read as ceremonies kicked off to mark the 80th anniversary of the June 6, 1944 D-Day landings, when more than 150,000 Allied soldiers invaded France by sea and air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US leader Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Britain's King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the Allied powers, paid tribute to the tens of thousands of troops who fought on the beaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived to attend the ceremonies and hold talks with the leaders -- a stark reminder of the conflict between his country and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest guests of honour were some 200 surviving veterans in their late 90s or even over 100, some in wheelchairs, huddled in blankets as they gazed over the shores. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A survey by Hong Kong Unison revealed that about 57 percent of Nepalese individuals found discrimination to be a serious problem in the SAR. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756364_1_20240606174406.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating for racial equality on Thursday called on the government to offer language and cultural courses to Nepalese parents and youths to help them integrate into Hong Kong society and prepare them with skills for better employment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A survey by Hong Kong Unison found that one in five Nepalese youths had been sent back to Nepal by their parents for reasons including family problems, forced marriage and drug abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Tse, executive director of the organisation, said authorities need to boost education measures to help local Nepalese youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They should really put their top priority in the field of education, particularly in the learning of Chinese so that if Nepalese students are doing well in school, hopefully they would be successful in their academic career and then have some sort of social mobility," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, unfortunately, because of the language barrier and the lack of education, many of them can't finish secondary school. Even if they can finish secondary school, they would end up finding a really low-level kind of job which is not really good for them in the long run."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 268 adolescents and young adults were interviewed, with almost half saying their biggest concern was the language barrier and the lack of educational support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Limbu Eliza, a Nepalese youth who was born and raised in Hong Kong, said she personally struggled with discrimination and learning Cantonese growing up, which made schooling and finding a job very difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most companies don't hire our ethnic minority (EM) people. Whenever they see you are EM people, [they] don't want to hire you. They will just reject you immediately. No need for interview, you can just go, which is I think unfair for us," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of them, even though they know Cantonese, but [companies] judge us by our colour, our face, our culture, and that is why they will always reject us. I think that is the most difficult thing [about] finding a job in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation also recommended special programmes tailored to Nepalese individuals to combat drug abuse, after the survey noted 70 percent of youth found drug abuse to be a significant problem.

<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK understands that a man known for challenging government policies in court has been arrested on suspicion of scamming the authorities out of different kinds of social benefits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested a man surnamed Kwok, 85, in Cheung Chau on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said he's Kwok Cheuk-kin, often known as the king of judicial reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the man is suspected of making false statements over his income and assets, for the alleged purpose of deceiving the government to receive subsidies such as public housing, fruit money, social security and legal aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the alleged deception took place between 2013 and 2022, and the arrest was made after thorough investigation by the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspect was released on bail and stressed that fraud carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail.

    E-cigarettes, smoking in a queue to be banned

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-cigarettes, flavoured cigarettes and lighting up while in a queue are set to be banned in Hong Kong, as part of measures designed to bring about a "cultural change" when it comes to smoking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A ban on selling or importing alternative smoking products (ASP) came into force more than two years ago, but it is still legal to possess them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee on Thursday said the government plans to outlaw e-cigarettes and similar products completely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One should not be able to have any legal means to purchase or to get hold of such ASP. So anyone who is still using ASP currently... presumably they are using the stocks that they purchased before April 2022," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So a reasonable assumption is that by a certain time... if they possessed any ASP, should have already consumed all of the remaining leftover."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other planned measures aimed at cutting the number of smokers in the SAR include removing branding from cigarette packaging and a ban on smoking while in queues for public transport, theme parks or medical facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke-free areas will also be extended to the entrances and exits of all childcare centres, schools and homes for the elderly. The fine for smoking in smoke-free areas will be doubled to HK$3,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Existing laws banning the sale of cigarettes to under-18s will be extended to cover those who offer them to minors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The key principle is that we want to protect our youngsters, our next generation. So what we are doing now is actually an education process, a cultural change, a behavioural change," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think another important aspect is that through education and promotion, we will educate our young people that they should not receive tobacco products. At the same time, we send a very clear message to the adults that one should not sell, nor should one provide such tobacco products to our young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said the harm of smoking should not be sugar-coated, so flavoured cigarettes will also be banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These flavoured cigarettes with additives are actually like an advertisement trying to hide the irritating taste of the smoke and at the same time hiding the harmful effect of all these tobacco products to make it like a sugar coating on a toxic product," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat illicit cigarettes, the government will introduce a duty-paid cigarette labelling system and double the fine for smuggling illicit cigarettes to HK$2 million, while increasing the jail term from two to seven years. In addition, the government will continue to increase tobacco duty to discourage smoking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the government aims to table the legislative amendments required before the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael, a cigarette smoker, told RTHK that more people will use conventional tobacco products when electronic cigarettes are completely banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that would be illegal, then more people would be returning to buying cigarettes. Because most of them, they try to quit smoking with the electronic cigarettes such as vape," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But then now, if they're going to ban it, then I think it'll be much more difficult for people to quit smoking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-smoker surnamed Chan said she welcomes the government's plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I don't smoke, I support it. I don't really want to inhale second-hand smoke. In the past, for example, when queuing or taking the elevator, there would often be someone next to me smoking. I would just walk away. I wouldn't hang around," she said.

    Privacy watchdog clears exams body over charges

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Privacy Commissioner says the exams regulator didn't violate the law regarding charges for marking record and exam script checks. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756346_1_20240606154522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog on Thursday dismissed complaints the local exams regulator had violated privacy laws by overcharging public exam candidates for their marking records and exam script checks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The law stipulates that organisations cannot charge a fee higher than the lowest possibly imposed for people seeking a copy of their personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Examinations and Assessment Authority turned electronic and stopped providing hard copies for those seeking their records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It lowered the fee for checking the first subject by HK$20 to HK$380, and kept the fee for each additional subject unchanged at HK$104.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four candidates who sat last year's DSE exams then filed complaints to the Privacy Commissioner, saying they were charged too much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an investigation, privacy commissioner Ada Chung said the fees charged were already lower than the directly related necessary costs, such as those for payroll and computer operating time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The commissioner found that the fees imposed by the [authority] for complying with the data access requests were not excessive and it had not contravened [the ordinance]," she said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One complainant also argued the exams body had been overcharging for a decade starting from 2012, saying it actually retained scanned copies of the records but only gave people hard copies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chung also said this was unsubstantiated, saying the authority was only providing the data in one form and therefore didn't violate the law.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian officials on Thursday said an Israeli strike on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed up to 40 people, including 23 women and children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat had a hidden Hamas command post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people," Thawabta told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack happened after Israel announced a new military campaign in central Gaza as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 There will be more cooperation between the creative industries in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, Culture Secretary Kevin Yeung said on Thursday at an annual meeting on cultural exchanges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “This year's meeting has been very successful, with many collaborative projects showing positive development. It's very encouraging,” he said at the 22nd Greater Pearl River Delta Cultural Cooperation Meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope that this conference framework will guide cultural exchange and cooperation between the three regions, and elevate the depth and breadth of our collaboration to a new level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that over the next five years, the SAR government will allocate HK$135 million to support local art groups and artists in exchange programmes within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also plans to bring more local cultural events, including the Hong Kong Pop Culture Festival, to the bay area, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong’s culture and tourism director general, Li Bin, said creating a well-known cultural tourism brand in the region is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that promotions for art performances and exhibitions will be more closely connected, with more interactions among official accounts on WeChat, Douyin and Xiaohongshu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Macau’s cultural affairs minister, Leong Wai-man, said the city hosted over 2,000 large-scale performances and more than 10,000 cultural events last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Macau could play the role as a major entertainment hub in the bay area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific on Thursday announced that it will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, from October 28.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Air Connectivity Program, which comes under Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cathay Pacific’s CEO Ronald Lam said the new flights will help business and tourism prosper in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Riyadh is a very vibrant city. It is the capital and financial centre of Saudi Arabia. By having direct flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh, we will be contributing to the prosperity of business, trade and tourism between China and Saudi Arabia,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme's CEO, Majid Khan, said the launch of the direct flights will bring more tourists to both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is one of the key markets in terms of tourism and trade from both sides. So we believe Cathay, we're going to grow the point-to-point traffic from both sides between Hong Kong and Riyadh and vice versa, but also the traffic to domestic Saudi Arabia and to the network beyond Hong Kong, where Cathay has a vast network,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay axed a previous service to Riyadh in 2017.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men's and women's national rugby sevens teams are preparing to contend for the final berth at the Olympics next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They will have to win the repechage tournament in Monaco at the end of the month for the trip to Paris and are among 12 entries battling for the last spots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's team are in the same pool with Canada, Great Britain and Uganda, while the women's squad face Poland, Czech Republic and Mexico in pool play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's assistant coach, Zhu Jing, said the most important thing is for the team to fight as one on the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said even though other countries are traditionally considered stronger in rugby sevens, Asians, like Chinese, also have their own advantages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of potential, actually Chinese people have quite an advantage. Because we have speed and agility. When we play we are actually better in these attributes compared to players from Europe or the Americas," Zhu told Hong Kong reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach said he's looking forward to seeing good performances from a couple of players. He said Shan Changshun and the captain, Li Haitao, have good physique and awareness on the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, for his part, said the team was focusing on improving their fitness ahead of the do-or-die tournament, as well as working on tactical adjustments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Making the Olympics for sure is every athlete's ultimate dream. We'll do our best yeah, do our best to get that ticket to Paris," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all in good shape, training with great enthusiasm. Also, in everyday life we're all very united as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the players were having extra sessions in the weight room, and the sports science team has helped their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he thinks the team's biggest foes are themselves, and all they need to do is to give it their best shot.

 Police have arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of drug trafficking, following a raid in Sheung Shui on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During the operation, officers seized over 1,300 bottles of CBD oil and more than 2.8 kilogrammes of suspected cannabis buds, with a street value of nearly HK$1.9 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they also found packaging bags, sealing machines and electronic scales at the scene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people died and more than 20 were injured when a passenger train collided with a freight train in the Czech city of Pardubice late on Wednesday, emergency and government officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least 20 people suffered light injuries and another three were more seriously hurt in the crash which occurred after 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) in Pardubice, along the country's main rail corridor from Prague to the east, Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passenger train, operated by RegioJet, was travelling overnight from Prague to Kosice in eastern Slovakia, according to the Railway Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fire Rescue Services said more than 300 passengers were on board. Dozens of police, fire and emergency service units responded to the accident, helping evacuate carriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage after the crash on news website idnes.cz showed at least one carriage off the track, while police showed on their X social media account a line of emergency service vehicles and a helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech Television cited a fire brigade spokesperson saying the freight train was carrying calcium carbide, although the first two wagons were empty, so no leak occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Martin Kupka, who travelled with the interior minister to the crash site, told a televised briefing an investigation into the accident was beginning and it was too early to speculate on its cause. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The CST-100 Starliner lifts off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756278_1_20240606034809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), following years of technical problems, delays and a 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad from Florida's Atlantic Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 400 kilometres above Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will need to execute precise manoeuvres to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts - Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams - to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wants the Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wrote on social media that Starliner "has reached a safe, stable orbit on its Crew Flight Test" and is headed to the space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner ascends to the heavens," NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the US space agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson called the launch "a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs on Wednesday, powered mainly by technology stocks as markets digested economic data that could support a much-expected start to the Federal Reserve's policy easing cycle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to end at 5,354, the Nasdaq Composite gained just under two percent to 17,187. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 percent to 38,807.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The May private payrolls report on Wednesday became the latest data to suggest an easing in labour market tightness that could propel the Fed to begin cutting rates this year. A report on Tuesday showed job openings fell in April to the fewest in more than three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're seeing the economic data starting to ease up a little bit and the repercussions for that is that you're seeing the pressure on rates come off the boil a little bit mixed in with the potential for weaker economic data, which is a pretty good recipe for the bond market," said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a nearly 69 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Expectations had hovered around 50 percent last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US 10-year Treasury yields fell to a two-month low on Wednesday after a report pointed to weaker-than-expected job growth ahead of Friday's highly anticipated government employment report for May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip stocks leapt, buoyed by gains to Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both touched record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose after forecasting third-quarter revenue above Street expectations, helped by upbeat demand for its AI servers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel gained after buyout firm Apollo Global Management agreed to purchase 49 percent for US$11 billion in a joint venture related to the chipmaker's Ireland manufacturing unit. (Reuters)

    Modi to be sworn in as Indian PM on Saturday

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756276_1_20240606034343.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hindu-nationalist party of Narendra Modi agreed with allies on Wednesday to form a government after a general election in which it failed to secure an outright majority for the first time in a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-member National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition -- led by Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- has 293 seats in parliament, giving it control of the legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all unanimously choose respected NDA leader Narendra Modi as our leader," a BJP-issued alliance statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the NDA government would "preserve India's heritage" and work for the "all-round development of the country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election results released on Tuesday upended conventional wisdom throughout the six-week election that Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda would power him to a landslide win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said Modi's reliance on coalition partners means he faces the prospect of a far tougher-than-expected third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will force Modi to take the point of view of others -- we shall see more democracy and a healthy parliament," said Nilanajan Mukhopadhyay, who has written a biography of Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will have to be a leader that he has never been; we will have to see a new Modi."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian media reports said Modi would be sworn in as prime minister on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China congratulated Modi earlier on Wednesday and said it was "ready to work" with its neighbour, while Japan also applauded the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, 73, insisted on Tuesday night that the election results were a victory that ensured he would continue his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our third term will be one of big decisions and the country will write a new chapter of development," Modi told a crowd of cheering supporters in the capital New Delhi after his win. "This is Modi's guarantee." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mirra Andreeva fought back to defeat second seed Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756273_1_20240606024121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's Mirra Andreeva became the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist since 1997 with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka, who was struggling with an apparent illness, at the French Open on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old fought back from a set down against her ailing opponent to win 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-4 after two hours and 29 minutes and set up a last-four meeting with Italy's Jasmine Paolini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, aged 17 and 29 days, is the youngest woman to make the semis at a major event since Martina Hingis at the US Open 27 years ago and also the youngest at Roland Garros since Hingis in 1997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly I was really nervous before the match, I knew she'd have an advantage," said Andreeva, who had lost both her previous meetings with Sabalenka in straight sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I see the game, I play whenever I want, I don't really have a plan. When I see an open space on the court I try to play, I try to play behind her back or something like this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Me and my coach, we had a plan today but again I didn't remember anything. I just try to play as I feel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will fancy her chances of going all the way to the final when she faces Paolini -- who had never got past the second round at a Grand Slam before this year -- on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka called for multiple medical time-outs as she complained of not feeling well and Andreeva, playing in her maiden Slam quarter-final, eventually took advantage with a composed display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka had powered through the first four rounds but was clearly having difficulties, breathing heavily between points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, currently ranked 38th, had already secured a breakthrough into the world's top 30 with her run to the last eight, but is now poised to rise further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tournament favourite Iga Swiatek plays US Open champion Coco Gauff in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka had been targeting a seventh straight Slam semi-final and had won 11 consecutive matches at the majors following her second Melbourne title earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was immediately clear that Sabalenka was not at her best, as she made four double-faults across her opening two service games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva suffered from nerves in key moments, failing to serve out the first set when leading 5-4, before Sabalenka rallied to take a tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It appeared as though Sabalenka would race away from her young rival -- the youngest woman to make the quarter-finals since 2005 -- when she broke in the first game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva hit straight back, with Sabalenka continuing to shake her head and crouch down between points in apparent pain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair traded breaks once more before Sabalenka again called for the trainer, saying she needed "something to make me feel better".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva was starting to get on top and levelled the match on her second set point as Sabalenka dumped a tired backhand into the bottom of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka was still grimacing and complaining towards her box early in the third set, but suddenly found her groove to break to love for a 3-2 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She could not back it up with a hold, though, as Andreeva quickly drew level and then moved 5-4 ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka failed to extend the contest behind her own serve as Andreeva sealed a famous victory in fine style, with a magnificent lob from way behind the baseline. (AFP)

    World's temperatures likely to breach 1.5 degrees: UN

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Climate change is taking a heavy toll around the world, fuelling extreme weather, flooding and drought. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756271_1_20240606021738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Humanity now faces an 80 percent chance that Earth's temperatures will at least temporarily exceed the key 1.5-degree Celsius mark during the next five years, the UN predicted on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2015 Paris climate accords, which set the ambitious target of limiting the world to a temperature increase of 1.5 C over pre-industrial levels, meant to refer "to long-term temperature increases over decades, not over one to five years", the UN's World Meteorological Organization said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report came alongside another by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service announcing that last month was the hottest May on record, pointing to human-induced climate change -- and spurring UN chief Antonio Guterres to compare humanity's impact on the world to "the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chance of temporarily exceeding the limit in the next five years ahead has been rising steadily since 2015, when such a chance was estimated to be close to zero, the UN's weather and climate agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is an 80 percent likelihood that the annual average global temperature will temporarily exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for at least one of the next five years," WMO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, the risk of temporarily breaching the limit within five years was estimated at 66 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already, dramatic climate shifts have begun taking a heavy toll worldwide, fuelling extreme weather events, flooding and drought, while glaciers are rapidly melting away and sea levels are rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on a record-breaking warming path," WMO deputy chief Ko Barrett told reporters in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "WMO is sounding the alarm that we will be exceeding the 1.5 C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that "we have already temporarily surpassed this level for individual months".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barrett noted though that temporary breaches "do not mean that the 1.5 C goal is permanently lost because this refers to long-term warming over decades".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the trend is alarming and cannot be denied."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperature levels are rising, with 2023 by far the hottest year on record, amid warnings that 2024 could be even hotter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, the WMO predicts that the mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2024 and 2028 will be 1.1-1.9 C above the pre-industrial levels recorded between 1850 and 1900.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to repeated monthly temperature records over the past year, the WMO highlighted that already the past 12 months, from June 2023 to May 2024, were "the highest on record".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it said there was now an 86-percent chance that one of the years between 2024 and 2028 would unseat 2023 as the annual record-holder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said there was a 90-percent likelihood that the mean temperature for 2024-2028 would be higher than that over the past five-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are way off track to meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement," Barrett said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday hit back at criticism by "some individuals" of the city's  economic and financial development, which it said had "clearly overlooked the existing advantages and the current positive development momentum of Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said in a statement that it intended to set the record straight, saying China's real economic growth rates in the first quarter and for all of 2023 were both above five percent, "ranking it among the fastest-growing major economies in the world".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It quoted an International Monetary Fund study which had concluded that the Mainland economy contributed to more than 30 per cent of global economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the SAR was also growing steadily, increasing by 3.3 per cent in 2023, and notching up year-on-year real gross domestic product growth of 2.7 percent. It said it was estimated to grow by 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also defended the city's status as a financial hub, saying Hong Kong stocks market capitalisaion exceeds HK$33 trillion, which is 10 times higher than at the time of the handover in 1997, while Stock Connect had also brought about a cumulative northbound and southbound capital flows of more than 1.8 trillion yuan and HK$3.1 trillion respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These figures demonstrate that Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, has fully utilised its ability to mobilise both Mainland and foreign capital, and will continue to play a key role in helping to 'bring in' international enterprises and investors, as well as assisting mainland enterprises to 'go out',"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also singled out other highlights in the stock market, including the average daily transaction volume of Exchange Traded Funds on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange exceeding HK$13 billion in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the China Securities Regulatory Commission had also recently announced five new measures to support the development of Hong Kong's financial sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the one country, two systems principle was the cornerstone of the city's prosperity, and the Basic Law protected freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its successful implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and Safeguarding National Security Ordinance had "brought about a safe and stable environment conducive to investment and financial development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this year, a survey conducted by a major foreign chamber of commerce reflected that nearly 80 per cent of its members interviewed had confidence in the rule of law in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 per cent of them also indicated that the operation of their enterprises had not been affected by the National Security Law," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It underlined Hong Kong's status in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Various data and facts not only reflect the performance of Hong Kong's economic and financial development, but more importantly, highlight Hong Kong's unique advantages and strategic position under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as well as its resilience and flexibility, in the face of global instability," it said. "Despite the fact that external environment will remain complicated, the Mainland and Hong Kong's economic growth is steadily improving, and even in a faster pace than some developed economies."

    Lawsuit says Google parent abused its position

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Google has urged Britain's competition watchdog to block a lawsuit that accuses the tech giant of abusing its position. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756264_1_20240605234046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google parent Alphabet must face a lawsuit worth up to 13.6 billion pounds for allegedly abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit, which seeks damages on behalf of publishers of websites and apps based in the United Kingdom, is the latest case to focus on the search giant's business practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action is bringing the claim on behalf of publishers who say they have suffered losses due to Google's allegedly anti-competitive behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google last month urged the CAT to block the case, which it argued was incoherent. The company "strongly rejects the underlying allegations", its lawyers said in court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CAT said in a written ruling that it would certify the case to proceed towards a trial, which is unlikely to take place before the end of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tribunal also emphasised the test for certifying a case under the UK's collective proceedings regime – which is roughly equivalent to the United States' class action regime – is relatively low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Google works constructively with publishers across the UK and Europe," Google legal director Oliver Bethell said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bethell added: "This lawsuit is speculative and opportunistic. We'll oppose it vigorously and on the facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Claudio Pollack, a partner of Ad Tech Collection Action, said: "This is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google's anti-competitive conduct in ad tech. Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action's case comes amid ongoing probes by regulators into Google's adtech business, including by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google is also fighting two lawsuits in the United States, one brought by the Department of Justice and another by Texas and other states, accusing the company of anti-competitive conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google's lawyers said in documents for the CAT case that the company's "impact in the ad tech industry has been hugely pro-competitive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wednesday's decision is the latest against a tech giant to be given the green light by the CAT, which already this year has certified a US$3.8 billion case against Facebook parent Meta and a nearly US$1 billion case against Apple. (Reuters)

    Australia admits defeat in battle against X

    <![CDATA[<img alt="X, formerly Twitter, was criticised after video of an attack in a church spread widely on social media and sparked a riot. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756263_1_20240605234336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's online watchdog on Wednesday dropped a legal effort to force Elon Musk's X to remove posts depicting the violent stabbing of a Sydney priest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have decided to discontinue the proceedings in the Federal Court against X Corp," eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog had ordered Musk's company to globally remove about 65 video and audio clips of the April 15 non-fatal attack in a church.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But X challenged the commission's right to make a global takedown order, arguing that geoblocking users in Australia was enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog had argued X's measures were easily dodged with the use of popular location-masking services like VPN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant -- a former Twitter employee -- defended the decision to take legal action: "I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disputed posts showed Assyrian orthodox Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel being stabbed about six times during a live-streamed sermon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video of the attack, which spread widely on social media and sparked a riot by followers of the church in western Sydney, has been blamed by Australian authorities for feeding tensions in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 16-year-old has been charged with "committing a terrorist act" in relation to the attack, which is said to have been religiously motivated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eSafety Commissioner said most Australians accepted that such graphic material should not be broadcast on television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This "begs an obvious question of why it should be allowed to be distributed freely and accessible online 24/7 to anyone, including children," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant said X routinely took down content globally, citing its removal of a compilation video of a knifeman's rampage in a Sydney shopping mall in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other major platforms had complied with the watchdog's requests and removal notices related to the church attack, she said, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Snap, TikTok, Reddit and Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is because the video violated their terms of service and their standards of decency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant said she now "welcomed the opportunity" for a merits-based review of her decision by the country's Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her decision to drop the case followed a setback last month when the Federal Court refused to extend the order for a global ban while the court case was being fought. (AFP)

    HKU head says wasn't told about new appointments

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president and vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Zhang Xiang, on Wednesday confirmed he wasn't told about new senior staff appointments by the HKU council, saying it severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an email to HKU teaching staff and students, Zhang said the council's move to appoint several interim vice-presidents without consulting him violated established procedures and disregarded the fundamentals of good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the University of Hong Kong Ordinance and Statutes, the president was granted the authority to appoint temporary senior management officers, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Neither were the nominations for these interim vice-presidents recommended by me, nor was I consulted about them. The university management did not have prior knowledge of these appointments at all," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stability and development of our University, as well as the reputation of Hong Kong, are now at risk, not to mention the negative impact on our efforts to attract global talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes reportedly include a demotion for Richard Wong, Zhang’s right-hand man and deputy vice-chancellor, who had served as the university’s interim provost since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that Wong had been appointed as a vice-president and would oversee institutional advancement, while his original post would be taken up by Vivian Yam, a professor at the science faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Zhang said he was thrilled that HKU had ranked higher than ever before in the new QS World University Rankings, adding he was dedicated to leading the institution to new heights and positioning it alongside the world's leading universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU climbed up nine places to 17 on QS’s list of the world’s top universities.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 16,000 pupils - or 84 percent of the intake - were accepted into their top three schools in this year's central allocation of Primary One places on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau earlier announced that a total of 19,204 children took part in the central allocation exercise, and the overall satisfaction rate was 92.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau reminded parents to register their child with the school allocated from next Tuesday to Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some parents were happy with the outcome, while others went to their targeted schools for interviews as a last resort to compete for the remaining few places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parent lined up outside a primary school in Yau Ma Tei from 9am for "door knocking" and tried his luck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We live nearby and the school is famous. [My kid] has prepared by earning some certificates and participated in competitions. But I'm not very optimistic, because the school is quite popular," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School in Wong Tai Sin said it was unfair that it was only allowed to operate one Primary One class instead of two, saying it had admitted at least 31 pupils this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the bureau said the decision was based on established mechanisms because the total number of students admitted was less than 41.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain on Wednesday paid tribute to those who took part in D-Day, promising to "always remember" the sacrifices made by the Allied soldiers who invaded France by sea and air to drive out the forces of Nazi Germany in the World War II operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With guests waving British flags, appearances from veterans, recollections and readings - and some tears in Queen Camilla's eyes - the British ceremony took place in Portsmouth, the main departure point for the 5,000 ships that headed to Normandy on June 6, 1944.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we come together to honour those nearly 160,000 British, Commonwealth and Allied troops who, on 5th June 1944, assembled here and along these shores to embark on the mission which would strike that blow for freedom and be recorded as the greatest amphibious operation in history," King Charles said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, as we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory, whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us, once again, commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day and to live up to the freedom they died for."
  <br/>

    New teaching kit to help autistic teens make friends

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two social welfare groups on Wednesday introduced a new teaching kit to help teenagers with autism make friends, saying they often find it hard to fit in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Family Planning Association and Wai Ji Christian Service worked together to design games and story cards that teach autistic teens to interact with others in different social scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Fung, a clinical psychologist with the Christian group, said autistic children struggle to read other people’s emotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Their main difficulty is they don't really recognise the facial expression or the reaction from others. Therefore, they might have a lot of difficulties recognising their reaction and coming up with an appropriate response to them,” she said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, said the teaching kit helps them understand what's expected in social situations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With these stories shown to them, they can actually say, 'Oh, this is what people expected, this is what's going wrong.' So they can learn from seeing. They can learn from understanding,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published by the Census and Statistics Department showed that 22,400 people are living with autism in Hong Kong as of 2020, making up 0.3 percent of the total population.

    Subpar taxi fleets could be banned: authorities

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government hopes new taxi fleets will drive up service quality. File photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756208_1_20240605164135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fleets set to hit the streets of Hong Kong could be suspended from doing business if their service quality isn't up to scratch, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department is currently vetting 15 applications for taxi fleet licences, with up to five successful bidders expected to be announced in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to questions from lawmaker Edward Leung, Acting Transport Secretary Liu Chun-san said taxi fleet operators will need to take part in a mid-term appraisal and their performance would be taken into account should they wish to renew their licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport commissioner would be able to initiate an inquiry should a fleet fail to meet the required standards and a number of sanctions would be available, such as a licence suspension or withdrawing certain taxis from the fleet, Liu said in a written reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year saw a 75 percent surge in complaints against taxi drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of the 1,006 cases filed to the authorities were related to drivers refusing hire, while another 340 cabbies were accused of overcharging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But authorities cautioned that the jump in complaints came against a low base of comparison in 2022, when Hong Kong was still curtailed by Covid restrictions.

    Five arrested over suspected fake drugs, cosmetics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Wednesday said they had arrested five people on suspicion of selling counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetic products in Mong Kok worth around HK$620,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were suspected to have violated the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested were three men and two women aged between 28 and 90.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An investigator from the Customs and Excise Department, Kenny Chan, said that salespersons, working for a supplier, brought the goods to retailers to sell at low prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspected counterfeit items were found in an operation on Tuesday, when officers searched three retail outlets in Mong Kok and a warehouse in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said it was difficult for customers to tell the difference between genuine and counterfeit goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he noted that while the packaging and bottles of the suspected counterfeits looked real enough, some of the anti-counterfeiting features were not done in a detailed manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you compare the real goods to the counterfeit ones, the pattern at the bottom of the bottles is different. It's smooth for the genuine goods and relatively rough for the fakes," Chan said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can also see that the trademarks printed on the genuine goods are clear whereas for the counterfeits they are not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan believed that some of the counterfeit goods had already been sold on the market, but officers had not received any complaints from the public so far, such as the products causing skin rashes or other more serious issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said samples of the goods would be sent to the government laboratory for tests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tourism project involving the use of augmented reality (AR) technology has been expanded to Lei Yue Mun, allowing people to learn more about the cultural and historical development of the area famous for its seafood.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Visitors can use a mobile app to scan AR markers at six locations along the harbourfront to see a panorama mixing photos from the past and drawings of what the surroundings looked like from the 1920s to the 1970s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Narrative texts describe the changes to iconic landmarks, such the Tin Hau Temple, Sam Ka Tsuen and the past quarry zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "City in Time" project was launched by the Tourism Commission in 2021, with the initial phase featuring popular tourist spots like Central, The Peak and Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Project manager Yip Tsz-lam said the programme has now been extended to other communities rich in culture or history, such as Lei Yue Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most people know Lei Yue Mun as a seafood paradise, but through our research, we discovered that there are many other interesting historical values in Lei Yue Mun, like the quarrying history, the Hakka culture and also the Tin Hau Temple,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about the panoramic artwork. Visitors can also gain in-depth understanding through the historical narratives and also the old photos.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said it took the research team half a year to gather about 300 old photos to recreate a realistic scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are not many old photos available from universities or any other sources. We rely on the descriptions from villagers and they also provided us with a lot of photos from their family albums,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we're very grateful that a restaurant owner provided us with a photo of him and his father in the 1970s. We provided that photo to the artist and the artist drew them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip added that the programme will later be expanded to Tai Hang and Kowloon City.

    Courtesy ambassadors to improve taxi relations
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Courtesy ambassadors will be stationed at some of the SAR's busiest taxi stands. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756179_2_20240605140015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Taxi Council on Wednesday said that courtesy ambassadors would be stationed at some of the SAR's busiest taxi stands, including at checkpoints and the airport, from June 6 to August 27, to distribute leaflets and souvenirs to passengers and drivers to encourage better service.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The exercise is part of this year's annual taxi courtesy campaign in conjunction with the Tourism Board's hospitality campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, the Taxi Council's chairman Ryan Wong said he hopes this new measure could improve the image of taxi drivers, and also improve communication between drivers and passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have hired university students to be our courtesy ambassadors. Our council has provided them with some training so that they understand the purpose of our campaign and also the services they will provide," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, in addition to our courtesy ambassadors, members of the council will also be on site. If there are questions that the students cannot answer, like industry-related questions, our members can help can help out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick added that service would also be enhanced with more taxis incorporating electronic payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that there are several systems that are available and [are being] installed in the taxi fleets now," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By the introduction of the taxi fleet management scheme by the government, they are required to put this electronic payment system in there, so I'm sure that the situation will start to improve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who RTHK spoke to said that taxi services have improved over the years, but there are other aspects that could make journeys more enjoyable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daria, who takes a taxi two to three times a week, said a lot of old taxis have been replaced with more comfortable and newer vehicles, but said it is difficult to hail a cab, especially during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe have a better app, but right now, it doesn't work properly so for me, I cannot really order a taxi. The taxi drivers never pick up my order, so if they can [provide] more digital [options] to find taxis faster, it would be great," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, I've never experienced any rude behaviour to be honest, but also I know on the news, there are a few accidents involved where taxi drivers are quite old. I think authorities should limit the age as well because it might be dangerous for both the passenger and for the taxi driver."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krauchi, who takes a taxi to work every day, said it would be better if cabs accepted electronic payments, especially with rival Uber being cashless.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for new overnight high-speed trains to the mainland went on sale on Wednesday, with the first service to Beijing selling out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains to the capital and Shanghai will run Friday-Monday from June 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queues for tickets formed at West Kowloon Station, while mainland app 12306 showed no places left for the first train to Beijing, although people could join a wait list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were really happy when we saw the news [regarding the new services], so we immediately decided to travel to Shanghai," a woman told RTHK at West Kowloon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The journey time was 19 hours before, and it's only 11 hours now. The duration is eight hours shorter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman said she arrived at the station 90 minutes before tickets went on sale, to book a spot on a train to Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the price, it's a bit expensive. Our tickets cost one thousand dollars each. But it's not convenient for us to travel by plane. We're old people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man said he normally drives to the mainland, but wants to try the overnight train instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically, I have to go to Beijing once a year and I like trying new things," he said.

    'Wealth connect scheme could be widened further'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, says they are looking into further upgrading the cross-border Wealth Connect Scheme. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756167_1_20240605125906.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Eddie Yue on Wednesday said authorities are looking into the feasibility of further widening a wealth connect scheme to attract large sums of capital from the Greater Bay Area to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a wealth summit, Yue noted that the city’s de facto central bank upgraded the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme” to a 2.0 version in February, to cover a greater variety of investment products and enabling more mainland investors to trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said the authorities are now studying whether the scheme can be upgraded to a 3.0 version, so the city can better cater to private banking customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s still in the early days, [but] we are talking to the industry very closely about what's needed. Is it the quota? Or is it the scope of products? Or is it the selling process?” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, the quota. Currently, the individual quota is up to three million renminbi, but that's actually not quite enough for private bank clients. Is there a way to have a separate channel to capture the private bank clients?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The selling process has been a lot easier and smoother than before. But can it be further streamlined? Or can the marketing be made more active? Can the education be done better? I think there are still areas that we can look into in terms of improvements,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue added that a significant increase in capital inflows from the north to the SAR was observed following the previous upgrade, and indicated that a further expansion could potentially attract more middle-class investors in the development zone who have the greatest need to diversify their assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme, launched in September 2021, was Beijing’s first tailor-made plan to boost sales and capital flows between Hong Kong, Macau and the nine other cities in the Greater Bay Area.

    Deficit stops us giving bigger pay rises, says govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it hopes a 3 percent pay rise will boost morale among civil servants. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756158_1_20240605115952.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Wednesday said the government's financial situation doesn't allow it to give staff pay rises as high as levels indicated by the latest pay trend survey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a proposed 3 percent increase for all civil servants, after the survey pointed to rises of between 4.01 and 5.47 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said on RTHK that the decision to give an across-the-board rise wasn't made out of convenience, and many factors were considered, including a budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under such a situation, we hope the pay rise can be a form of recognition of the work of civil servants, regardless of which grade they belong to," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also hope to maintain everyone's morale, or go even further and boost morale. We think this is the appropriate level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same programme, the chairman of the Civil Servants General Union, Fung Chuen-chung, said people who think civil service pay should be frozen because of the deficit are missing the point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there's an important point that society at large has overlooked. For quite some time, there's been a high turnover rate for civil servants. It's also very hard to hire new people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So [the proposed 3 percent rise] hasn't taken these important factors into account."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said lower-ranking civil servants are particularly disappointed, because the survey pointed to a 5.47 percent increase for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said she understands that such workers had hoped for more, but said in 18 of the past 31 years, lower-ranking workers received the same increases as middle-ranking staff, even when the survey indicated smaller rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An honorary chairman of the Senior Government Officers Association, Lee Fong-chung, also expressed disappointment that the proposed rise doesn't match the pay trend survey levels, but said at least it will help staff cope with inflation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rising Chinese long jump star Zhang Mingkun said he is determined not to let the pressure get to him as he seeks qualification for the upcoming Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old said he is going to keep his mind at ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During a jump, your mind really goes blank. All you do is to enjoy it,” Zhang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long jumper, who has a personal record of 8.13m, has been striving to reach the 8.27m entry standard for the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll find out in about a month's time on whether his dream would come true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the rest of the track and field team, the sprinters have been training with a new foreign coach ahead of the Games, and they see the benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Here, our training is relatively traditional... but it’s more scientific overseas,” said runner Wang Shuang from Jiangsu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Female sprinter Huang Ziting knows that the odds are against them, but reaching the Olympic stage remains the ultimate goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m certain every athlete would want to stand on the Olympic podium, but it feels like it would be more difficult for Asians [to achieve that],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sprinter, Chen Jinfeng, said getting to Paris requires not only strong performances but a bit of luck as well.

 Nigel Farage, new leader of Britain's right-wing Reform Party and thorn in the side of the governing Conservatives, was doused with a soft drink on Tuesday in his first full day of campaigning for a seat in parliament in the July 4 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Farage produced the biggest shock of the campaign by announcing he would head Reform and run in the election, a major blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose Conservative Party trails Labour badly in surveys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage is best known for helping to lead a successful campaign in 2016 for Britain to leave the European Union, and his popularity has put pressure on a succession of Conservative leaders to be tougher on immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after he launched his campaign in the seat of Clacton-on-Sea, southeast England, a woman threw a large cup of soft drink over him as he left a pub, footage posted on social media showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He appeared unharmed as he was led away by security and later posed smiling in a video posted on X holding a McDonald's cup and joking: "My milkshake brings all the people to the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Tice, chairman of Reform, called the attacker a "juvenile moron", saying his party would not be intimidated and the incident would help it win hundreds of thousands more votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they had arrested a 25-year-old woman on suspicion of assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister James Cleverly condemned the incident as unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former commodities trader who is often pictured with a cigarette and pint of beer in hand, Farage has for three decades been the figurehead of euroscepticism in Britain, and is no stranger to controversy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charismatic and divisive, he has in the past made comments that his opponents have called racist. During the Brexit campaign, Farage appeared in front of a poster showing lines of migrants under the slogan "Breaking Point"; last month he said Muslims did not share British values.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was doused in milkshake in 2019 while campaigning for the Brexit Party, Reform's predecessor, in Newcastle before a European Parliament election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, his attacker was ordered to pay for his suit to be cleaned after pleading guilty to common assault and criminal damage. (Reuters)

    Sunak, Starmer clash in first UK poll debate

<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour challenger Keir Starmer went head-to-head on Tuesday over how to boost Britain's economy, with the PM accusing the opposition party of wanting to increase taxes if it wins power at a July 4 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Sunak, a Conservative, and Starmer stuck to their campaign lines in their first debate just weeks before a general election opinion polls suggest Labour is set to win, with Sunak saying only he had a plan to spur Britain's paltry economic growth and Starmer portraying the Conservatives as presiding over 14 years of economic chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a heated debate – a recent feature in Britain and one which sees more voters tune into politics – the two leaders battled over how to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, growing waiting lists in the public health service and reducing immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the questions illustrated what many voters are contending with: a cost-of-living crisis when some struggle to pay their household bills, long waits for the health service and lower standards in the education system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little new was gleaned from their answers, but an opinion poll taken immediately after the debate suggested Sunak had won the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Keir Starmer is asking you to hand him a blank cheque when he hasn't said what he'll buy with it or how much it's going to cost you," Sunak said in his closing comments. "In uncertain times we simply cannot afford an uncertain prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer responded saying he would never offer "the gimmicks or unfunded promises that Rishi Sunak does".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Imagine how you would feel waking up on July 5 to five more years of the Conservatives, five more years of decline and division, the arsonists handed back the matches," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now imagine turning the page with a Labour government that rolls up its sleeves and gets on with the job... The choice at this election is clear: more chaos with the Conservatives or the chance to rebuild Britain with a changed Labour Party." (Reuters)

    Wall Street up as jobs data boosts rates hope

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended a shade higher on Tuesday following softer-than-expected labor market data that reaffirmed expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Tuesday showed that US job openings fell to their lowest level in more than three years in April, signaling an easing in labour market tightness that supported a Fed rate cut this year. The US Treasury yields slipped following the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's main indexes gained ground after paring earlier loses. Equities in real estate and consumer staples sectors advanced ahead of others, while materials and energy stocks were the biggest losers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The labour market data was the latest in a string of recent reports that pointed to cooling US economic growth. Data on Monday showed that US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we've seen in the data so far this week is that it's been relatively weak, starting with manufacturing PMI and job openings today," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in Santa Monica, California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That has had a total effect of helping the rally in the bond market; but for the stock market, it's a double-edged sword because they're looking for a rate cut announcement, which has a rising probability with weaker data," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.36 percent, to 38,711, the S&P 500 gained 0.15 percent, to 5,291 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.17 percent, to 16,857.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacap technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, ended higher after losing ground early in the session. Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron fell 1.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, as demand concerns weighed on crude prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bath & Body Works slumped 12.8 percent after a lower revision to its quarterly profit forecast. Axos Financial dropped after Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in the lender. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The University of Hong Kong ranked 17th in the world. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756115_1_20240605043215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong once again has three universities in the world's top 50, with two more narrowly missing the cut, organisers of the QS World University Rankings revealed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University ranked higher than ever before, while the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology returned to the top 50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU was up nine places at seventeenth overall while CUHK climbed eleven places to 36th in the world. Meanwhile UST rose 13 places, ranking 47th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ranking is based on a study of 1,500 universities around the world. Evaluators consider nine indicators, including academic reputation, what employers think of an institution, the ratio of students to faculty and whether the university has many international students, staff and global networks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CUHK saw its scores improve in most areas, most notably sustainability, where it finished 132 places higher than last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said in a statement that it is highly regarded for its environmental concepts and leadership in creating and applying sustainable development solutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CUHK also earned a perfect score for its ratio of international faculty and a high score for academic citations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its president, Rocky Tuan, said the results demonstrate CUHK's commitment to academic excellence and ability to compete with world-class universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, HKUST said that despite being a newer institution, its embraces innovative teaching methods and resources that adapt to evolving societal need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was making the most of new technologies like artificial intelligence to enhance student learning and promote the SAR's goal of becoming an international innovation and technology centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Polytechnic University ranked 57th, continuing a climb in recent years, while City University was 62nd. Two other local universities were also ranked: Baptist University was placed joint 252nd while Lingnan University was in the 711-720 band.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was first overall, ahead of Imperial College London and Oxford University. The National University of Singapore ranked best in Asia and eighth overall. Peking University was China's best, finishing 14th in the world.

    No deal without permanent ceasefire: Hamas

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, speaks at a news conference. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756113_1_20240605025603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas cannot agree to any deal unless Israel makes a "clear" commitment to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a senior official from the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Qatar, which alongside the United States and Egypt has been mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, has also urged Israel to provide a clear position that has the backing of its entire government to reach a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot agree to an agreement that doesn't secure, guarantee, and ensure a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and completing a real serious swap deal accordingly," Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, told a televised press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-phase proposal presented by US President Joe Biden on Friday involved in its first phase a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from "all populated areas" of Gaza and some hostages – including the elderly and women – would be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under that plan, Hamas and Israel would negotiate in the same phase a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last "as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamdan said: "Israel only wants one phase where it takes all its hostages, then it resumes its aggression and war on our people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We ask mediators to get a clear position from the Israeli occupation to commit to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has previously said it viewed the contents of the proposal positively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States said on Sunday that if Hamas accepted the proposed plan it expected Israel to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third phase in the proposal would include a major reconstruction plan for the enclave, which has been devastated by eight months of war, and the return of the remains of dead hostages to their families.  (Reuters)

    Translator admits stealing US$17mn from Ohtani

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese baseball great Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty on Tuesday to stealing nearly US$17 million from the athlete's bank account to pay off his own gambling debts, according to US prosecutors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ippei Mizuhara, the onetime translator and de facto manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers' power-hitting pitcher, pleaded guilty in a deal that had been announced last month, a US Attorney spokesperson said. Sentencing will be on October 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was previously filed in US District Court in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offence punishable by up to three years behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly US$17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former interpreter's lawyer declined to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ohtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. (Reuters)

    US sets new rules for migrants at Mexican border

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Migrants attempt to cross into the United States through a fence at the Mexican border. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756105_1_20240605004341.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Migrants caught illegally crossing the US-Mexico border could be denied the chance to claim asylum and quickly deported or turned back to Mexico under new restrictions announced on Tuesday, part of a sweeping enforcement effort by US President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new measures will take effect immediately and will have exceptions for unaccompanied children, people who face serious medical or safety threats and victims of trafficking, a senior official said on a call with reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat, has toughened his approach to border security as immigration has emerged as a top issue for Americans in the run-up to November 5 elections where he will face/ Republican Donald Trump in a rematch of the 2020 contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new asylum restrictions are not permanent, the US official told reporters. They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deterrent measures "will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully," the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.

    Injured Djokovic pulls out of French Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Novak Djokovic is saying goodbye to this year's French Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756102_1_20240604235342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic's disappointing season continued on Tuesday when the defending French Open champion was forced to pull out of the Grand Slam before his quarter-final due to a knee issue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The injury, sustained in his fourth-round win over Francisco Cerundolo, ended the Serb's quest for a record-extending 25th Grand Slam trophy and will result in him losing the world number one ranking to Jannik Sinner later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to a torn medial meniscus in his right knee (discovered during an MRI scan), Djokovic, who was supposed to play Casper Ruud in the quarter-finals tomorrow, has been forced to withdraw from the Roland Garros tournament," organisers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year's runner-up and seventh seed Ruud will now advance to the semi-finals, where he could face fourth seed Alexander Zverev or 11th seed Alex de Minaur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's marathon match was the second straight clash in which Djokovic was taken to five sets after his epic against Lorenzo Musetti and he has spent over nine hours on court in the last two rounds at the year's second major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb said he had been carrying an injury for a couple of weeks and that the problem had flared up when he slipped during his match against Cerundolo. The injury could also cast doubts over his fitness for next month's Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been a season to forget for Djokovic after his bid for a record-extending 11th Australian Open title was ended by eventual champion Sinner in the semi-finals, before he lost to lucky loser Luca Nardi early at Indian Wells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having been stunned by Ruud in the Monte Carlo semi-finals, Djokovic was thrashed 6-2 6-3 by Alejandro Tabilo in the third round in Rome last month, two days after being hit on the head by a fan's water bottle while signing autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic is still without a trophy this season after one of the most dominant seasons of his career in 2023 during which he claimed three of the four Grand Slam titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Sinner stepped up his bid for a second Grand Slam title by securing a 6-2 6-4 7-6(3) victory over Grigor Dimitrov, minutes after it was confirmed he would be the new world number one. A trickier test could await, however, as he faces a potential clash against fellow young gun Carlos Alcaraz who meets Stefanos Tsitsipas later. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Tuesday that they’d made four arrests around Causeway Bay in connection with offences including breaches of national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a 68-year-old woman was arrested for alleged offences relating to seditious intention under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance after shouting slogans on Yee Wo Street in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said a 24-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman were arrested on the same street. The man is suspected of assaulting two police officers while the woman was held for disorderly conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile a 23-year-old man was arrested at Hing Fat Street on suspicion of assaulting two park security guards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had increased their patrols in Causeway Bay and Victoria Park, with officers taking aside a number of people throughout the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the afternoon, an officer warned a man – who was holding up a large poster near Sogo department store – that he was disrupting public order, and demanded that he stop. The man was then brought to a police vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At night, officers patrolled East Point Road and also brought a number of people to police vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, police presence was also stepped up at Victoria Park, where they set up a tent. Officers requested some people in the park to enter the tent. They were released after being searched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to queries, the force said it would make appropriate operational deployments in light of threats to public safety, public order and national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police said three men and two women, aged between 27 and 88, were taken back to the station on suspicion of breaching public peace. All were later allowed to leave.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two key regional allies in Narendra Modi's coalition have endorsed him as India's next prime minister, their spokespeople said on Tuesday, after trends showed Modi's party was falling short of a majority in a general election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal (United) said their pre-poll alliance with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)was intact and they would form the next government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their comments came after media speculation that the opposition alliance, which is doing much better than expected, was also in touch with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP is leading in 244 of the 543 seats in the directly elected lower house of parliament, according to evening vote count trends, unexpectedly falling short of a majority and raising its reliance on allies to be able to form the next government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, based in the southern coastal state of Andhra Pradesh, is currently the second-biggest party in Modi's National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the BJP. Naidu, who allied with the opposition the last time, has in the past spoken about loan waivers for farmers and privatisation of air and sea ports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "TDP has a pre-poll alliance with NDA and it will continue, no doubt about that," said party lawmaker K. Ravindra Kumar. "PM Modi and Naidu have congratulated each other."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party spokesperson Jyothsna Tirunagari said: "TDP has always shared a vision with PM Modi and he remains our PM face."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of the poor state of Bihar, has often switched sides and returned to Modi's alliance in January, having earlier helped form an opposition alliance of more than two dozen parties for the general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are formally with this NDA alliance and will participate in making the government," JD(U) spokesperson Abhishek Jha said. On being asked if the party would support Modi as NDA's prime minister, he said: "Definitely."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party focuses on issues of Bihar, especially for financial aid and investment to create jobs for its millions of young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two allies ... need stability at the centre to run their own states, but they will take their own pound of flesh," said Yashwant Deshmukh, founder of polling agency CVoter. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said tickets for overnight high-speed trains between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong would be available for sale from Wednesday noon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overnight trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and West Kowloon Station from June 15 from Fridays to Mondays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR said tickets would be available from Wednesday noon on the mainland's 12306 ticketing website or mobile app, and at ticket counters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares for one-way trips between Hong Kong and Beijing would be approximately between HK$937 and HK$1,448, while those between Hong Kong and Shanghai would be approximately between HK$682 and HK$2,128.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung welcomed the new arrangements which enhanced the services provided by the Hong Kong section of the express rail link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new sleeper trains...tailored to meet the passenger needs and provide them with a more convenient, comfortable and high-quality cross-boundary rail service, enhancing the travel experience for both business and leisure passengers," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Beijing resident said the new arrangement further encouraged him to visit Hong Kong one day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't like to travel by plane, so if high-speed trains have sleeping coaches, I won't feel tired even it's a long trip," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who's visiting Hong Kong, said she could manage time better if she travelled by high-speed trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to weather conditions these days, the situation of flight delays is very serious. My flight was delayed for almost eight hours, so travelling by high-speed trains may be more convenient," she said.

    Mainland tourism delegation wowed by HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Tuesday said an ongoing visit from a mainland trade delegation will provide more opportunities for the tourism industry and boost Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Representatives from eight mainland cities recently added to the Individual Visit Scheme are visiting the SAR to familiarise themselves with the city, to help them promote it as a destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delegation member Huang Ning, deputy general manager of a Harbin travel agency, said the group's visit will bring new momentum to the tourism market and foster economic and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The flight time from Harbin to Hong Kong is five hours. In the past, most of us would usually spend a night in Shenzhen before arriving in Hong Kong, but direct flights make it more convenient for passengers and more attractive to go straight to Hong Kong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People can go whenever they want. The launch [of Harbin's inclusion in the scheme] plus direct flights have really facilitated the desire for Harbin people to visit Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Xiaochun, general manager of Gansu Legend Travel Co. Ltd, said the shopping experience in Hong Kong is incredible, adding that she hopes the duty-free allowance for visitors can be increased from the current 5,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone is very friendly. This time we really felt that they were very hospitable. I really hope that the cap for the allowance can be increased. Our time here yesterday was too short. We felt that we didn't have enough time to go shopping," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The shopping experience is very pleasant here. We bought so many sports brand products here and also a lot of Hong Kong delicacies and snacks. The snacks here are very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang Tenghong, executive director of Tibet Tourism Investment and Tourism Service Co. Ltd, said he was impressed by the attractions the delegation visited, including Central Market and Tai Kwun, adding that the SAR offers great food and scenery.

    Legco supports expanded sex offender checks
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco supports expanded sex offender checks" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756054_1_20240604161222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday expressed support towards the government's plans to expand checks on sex offender records to gradually cover the self-employed, volunteers and existing workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The current system allows voluntary checks on prospective employees seeking jobs related to children and the mentally incapable, meaning the employer needs the consent of the job-seeker to perform the check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials now want the scheme expanded in the fourth quarter of this year, first covering self-employed persons such as sports coaches, music teachers and tutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of next year, the scope would expand to cover volunteers, and eventually at an unspecified date, all existing employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco security panel meeting, legislators said they supported the plan, saying it was necessary to better protect children and the mentally challenged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legal sector lawmaker Ambrose Lam asked whether the SAR would follow the UK system, known as the Sarah's Law, under which parents can seek records on a person who can come into contact with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in Hong Kong, parents sometimes ask a friend to help pick up their children from school, and the SAR should be forward-thinking in preventing potential abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, security chief Chris Tang dismissed the idea, saying the two places are different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong this is too broad a scope. At the moment, friends would not be included under this [expanded] scope," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others expressed concern the expanded scheme would add more work for the police force, and that people who sought the checks would have to wait for a long time at police stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of lawmakers, including New People's Party's Dominic Lee, asked if officials could handle the applications electronically, such as using the government's iAM Smart mobile app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Tang said the app cannot replace the stringent checks on the conviction records required, because it involves fingerprints of all fingers and thumbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials would conduct loading tests before the new system is up and running, which is capable of handling more than 210,000 new applications a year. Last year, there were around 83,000 ongoing requests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said six police stations planned to set up designated kiosks, allowing people to have their fingerprints collected throughout the day to help speed up the process.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's military on Tuesday said it would resume all military activities along the demarcation line separating the two countries and the North West Islands after suspending an inter-Korean military agreement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspension of the military agreement with the North, which South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol approved earlier on Tuesday, was in response to North Korea's decision to send hundreds of balloons carrying trash over the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The South Korean military makes it clear that it will take all necessary measures to protect the lives and safety of its people in response to North Korea's provocations," a defence ministry official said in an emergency briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The large-scale spraying of filth balloons has "seriously threatened the safety of our people and caused property damage," the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang on Sunday said it had sent up 15 tonnes of wastepaper using 3,500 balloons, while Seoul vowed "unendurable" measures against the North in response, which could include blaring propaganda from loudspeakers directed at the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the military pact, both countries agreed to "completely cease all hostile acts against each other" that are the source of military tension and conflict, through measures such as the two sides ending military drills near the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the most substantive deal to come out of months of historic summit meetings between the two Koreas in 2018, but had been all but scrapped when Pyongyang declared last year it was no longer bound by it. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Politicians and analysts say it was too early to get a firm idea of the voting trends. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756050_1_20240604154917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election on Tuesday, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, TV channels showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The early see-saw trends spooked markets with stocks falling steeply and the rupee also fell sharply against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, where 272 is a simple majority, in early counting at 2pm Hong Kong time. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's centrist Congress party was leading in over 220 seats, higher than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TV channels showed BJP accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, short of a majority on its own, compared to the 303 it won in 2019.

  A third Modi term with a slim majority for BJP – or having to depend on NDA allies for a majority – could introduce some uncertainty into governance as Modi has ruled with an authoritative hold over the government in the last decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, politicians and analysts said it was too early to get a firm idea of the voting trends since a majority of ballots were yet to be counted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a fair assessment to say 400 at the moment certainly looks distant," BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli told the India Today TV channel, referring to some projections that gave 400 seats to the NDA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we need to wait...to have a final picture of the seats because the exit polls speak of a massive sweep, [and] the counting trends currently don't seem to match that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The BJP-NDA will form the government, that trend is very clear from the start," he added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a Civil Service Bureau proposal to give staff of all ranks a 3 percent pay rise this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The increases would be lower than the rises of up to 5.47 percent indicated by the recent Pay Trend Survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said Exco considered various factors when agreeing to the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Executive Council has, in accordance with the mechanism governing the adjustment of civil service pay, considered six factors, namely the state of Hong Kong's economy, changes in the cost of living, the net pay trend indicators, the government's fiscal position, the pay claims of the staff side, as well as the civil service morale," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this is a balanced decision, taking into account all those six factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that while one in 10 civil service positions are vacant, salary is not the sole factor when it comes to retaining or attracting workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the pay rise proposal will be discussed with staff representatives on Wednesday before a final decision is reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, senior civil servants received a salary increase of 2.87 percent, while mid-ranking and junior staff had rises of 4.65 percent.

    Pair launch first civil action against JPEX

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two victims of alleged fraud cases involving the cryptocurrency trading company JPEX have lodged claims at the District Court to recover funds, in the first civil action against the platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The writ of summons, filed by plaintiffs Chan Wing-yan and Herbert Lee on Monday, listed JPEX Crypto Asset Platform as the first defendant, and locally-registered Web 3.0 Technical Support as the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three others, who appear as "holder of wallet address" for the three accounts on the trading platform, were also named as defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Chiu, a general manager of the over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange Coingaroo, is listed as the sixth defendant. The pair are also suing "any persons who carried out or assisted in the scheme".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the plaintiffs, Chan, said she invested with JPEX after being led to believe that the platform was a licensed cryptocurrency exchange upon attending seminars and reading posts from social media influencer Lam Chok, according to the legal document.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also claimed that she paid and transferred a total of HK$1.85 million to Chiu, intending to purchase USDT, also known as Tether, between July and August in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair found assets of more than 247,400 USDT were transferred away "within five minutes after each of the deposits was being made" without authorisation, and subsequently moved to "many other wallets of unknown holders" before they looked into their accounts on September 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plaintiffs are seeking to recover the lost funds and are asking the court to grant an injunction to bar the defendants to deal with the assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Chu, a lawyer handling the pair's claims, pointed to the far-reaching impacts of the civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the criminal investigation into the perpetrators continues, victims should also pursue civil proceedings to recover their lost assets. This dual-track approach is crucial, as the police are unable to return any seized funds without a court order from the civil case," he said in a statement to RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Notably, the findings from the civil proceedings may potentially bolster the parallel criminal investigation against the suspects, underscoring the importance of this multifaceted legal strategy for the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng, for his part, described the case as a "milestone", and that he understood that more victims have considered taking civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On my end, around 10 people have plans to make claims. Of course, I believe there might also be people who have yet to contact us [wanting to take action]," Ng said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wen Shuhao, chairman of QuantumPharm (centre), says the introduction of the Chapter 18C rule shows the SAR's capital markets value the technology sector.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland artificial intelligence drug research firm QuantumPharm on Tuesday said it plans to raise up to HK$1.13 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), as it becomes the first company to take advantage of a new rule designed to entice technology firms to list in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tencent-backed firm, also known as XtalPi, is offering 187.37 million shares, 95 percent of which will be issued internationally and five percent of which will be issued in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price range of the shares will be between HK$5.03 and HK$6.03, with an “entry fee” of HK$6,091. Trading will begin on June 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The listing is under the Chapter 18C rule introduced by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in March last year, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies with a valuation of at least HK$10 billion are allowed to sell shares in IPOs even if they are yet to generate revenue. For firms that have generated revenue, the valuation threshold is reduced to HK$6 billion if they had at least HK$250 million in sales in the financial year prior to their IPO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the firm’s chairman, Wen Shuhao, said the introduction of Chapter 18C shows the city’s capital markets value the technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company plans to bring in eight cornerstone investors with a combined contribution of nearly HK$338 million to subscribe for the shares, including Peter Lee, the chairman of Henderson Land Development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Tam, QuantumPharm's chief financial officer, said he believes the Shenzhen-headquartered firm will be able to generate profits in the near term, despite seeing losses over the past three financial years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chapter 18C rule applies to applicants in high-tech, advanced hardware and software, new materials, new energy, as well as food and agriculture technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other firm which has applied to list under the rule so far is Black Sesame International Holding, which produces chips for autonomous driving.
