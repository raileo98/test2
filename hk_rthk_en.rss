<div class="itemFullText">
 A 19-year-old Islamic State sympathiser planned a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, the country's intelligence agency said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Austrian authorities detained two suspects on Wednesday for allegedly plotting to attack one of three Vienna concerts by the US star due to start Thursday. All were cancelled at the last minute leaving disconsolate "Swifties" to gather in the Austrian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old main suspect had confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives," domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner told a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert, either today or tomorrow," he added. The concerts were to run from Thursday to Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian, was employed at a facility management company which would have "provided services" at the Ernst Happel Stadium where Swift was to perform, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The younger suspect, who has so far refused to talk to authorities, was "in the area" of the stadium when he was detained, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chancellor Karl Nehammer said there were "concrete and detailed" plans to commit a "blood bath".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner, a "tragedy was averted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation was very serious", he added, particularly in view of a recent attack at a Taylor Swift themed event in Britain, where three girls were killed in Great Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explosives and detonators were found in a search of the main suspect's apartment, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria's top security chief Franz Ruf told reporters the two suspects had recently made changes in their private lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main suspect, an Austrian with Northern Macedonian roots, had changed "his appearance and adapted it to Islamic State propaganda", while the second, an Austrian of Turkish or Croatian origin, had broken up with his girlfriend, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruf earlier confirmed that authorities had received information "from foreign partners" which led to the arrests, but he declined to specify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had promised to ramp up security for the concerts while having minimised any concrete danger, but organisers still cancelled Swift's shows. About 65,000 people were expected at each show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's fans gathered in parks and plazas across Vienna to share their disappointment. Dilyara Joldassova, a 23-year-old engineer who travelled from Kazakhstan for the show, said she was "broken-hearted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift did not immediately comment on the decision to cancel the Vienna shows but after the British attack said she was "completely in shock".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three girls were killed and five people seriously wounded in the mass stabbing at a dance class in Southport inspired by the American singer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Ruf, police "did everything humanly possible to ensure" that the Vienna concerts "could go ahead", but the cancellation decision was taken by the organisers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old star was to bring her record-breaking "Eras" Tour, which began its European leg in Paris in May, to Vienna on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following France, the tour stopped in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of last year, "Eras" had already become the first tour to sell more than US$1 billion in tickets and it's on track to more than double that by the time it concludes in Vancouver in December. (AFP)

    HK's Lo Wai-fung misses out in Taekwondo repechage

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China’s Lo Wai-fung wasn’t able to make a comeback in the men’s Taekwondo 68kg category, losing to national team athlete Liang Yushuai in the repechage at the Paris Olympic Games early on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two came in strong in the first round, but after a close battle, Liang came out on top in a close 5-4 contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unfortunately, Lo wasn’t able to take back control in the decisive second round, with Liang winning 13-0, care of two body kicks, a head kick and a five-point turning kick, bringing the SAR athlete’s Olympic debut to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo was previously defeated by reigning Olympic champion Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. Since the Uzbek athlete went on to make it to the final, Lo was granted entry to the repechage competition for a chance at bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, this is the first time a Hong Kong athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liang was to fight Britain's Bradly Sinden as he attempts to take bronze for China later in the morning.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new Banksy artwork depicting a wolf on a satellite dish in London was removed, possibly stolen, less than an hour after it was unveiled by the elusive street artist on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The piece was the fourth animal-themed artwork that Banksy had installed in various parts of the UK capital this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The street artist, whose identity is unknown and the subject of feverish speculation, confirmed on Instagram that the works were his own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wolf silhouette was located on the roof of an empty shop in Peckham, southeast London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photos from the scene carried by local media show a person climbing up a ladder to retrieve the satellite dish while another holds the ladder for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further images show an individual in shorts walking off with the piece of art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were called to reports of a stolen satellite dish containing artwork at 1:52 pm (12:52 GMT) on Thursday, 8 August in Rye Lane, Peckham," London's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There have been no arrests. Inquiries continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, a Banksy of a goat precariously perched on top of a wall with rocks tumbling down appeared in Richmond, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then on Tuesday two elephant silhouettes with their trunks stretched towards each other appeared in Fulham, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the black silhouette of three monkeys appeared on the side of a railway bridge as if they were swinging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several months usually pass between new Banksy artworks and this week's sudden spurt has sparked speculation among fans about their meaning. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's weightlifter Luo Shifang set three new Olympic records as she claimed gold in the women's 59kg category at the Paris Olympics on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luo, who's making her Olympic debut, lifted 107kg in the snatch and 134kg in the clean and jerk to go with a winning total of 241kg, all new highs at the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old's total in Paris was 7kg short of her own world record, set in Thailand in April this year at the weightlifting World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada's Maude Charron took home silver with 236kg, and the champion of the Tokyo Games, Chinese Taipei's Kuo Hsing-Chun, snatched bronze with 235kg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the third weightlifting gold for the national team in two days.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Xie Siyi on Thursday successfully defended his diving crown in men's 3m springboard at the Paris Olympics, with teammate Wang Zongyuan taking silver.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The result means the national team has now sealed six diving golds in its quest for a clean sweep in Paris, with just two more left to contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two teammates went neck and neck from the start, with only several points separating them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his last of six dives, Xie finished with a 100.7 – the only dive in the final that scored more than 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It ensured that he finished atop the podium again in Paris, having done the same in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, for his part, made a mistake in the second to last dive, meaning he finished the competition with 530.2 points, 13.4 less than his compatriot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xie, who came out of a brief retirement to compete in Paris, said he was nervous during the first two rounds of the final, when he was trailing Wang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the third round, I told myself: I need to slow down. There are so many spectators today – in the previous round there weren't that many," he told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So with so many people around suddenly, I needed to enjoy the atmosphere, the cheers. They may be for other teams, but I took them as though they were for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mexico's Osmar Olvera Ibarra grabbed bronze with just a little over 500 points.

 Radio Television Hong Kong has won an Asia-Pacific broadcasting award.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were over 100 entries from 30 countries and regions across the Asia-Pacific at this year’s Together for Planet, People, and Peace Media Awards, which was organised by the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition was divided into video and audio categories, with a focus on people, peace and the planet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK Radio 5’s programme “It’s a Happy Day” won the radio award for the “Peace” category on Wednesday.

  <br/>
  The show’s aim was to help people deal with stress and negative emotions during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each of the programme’s 365 episodes was about a minute long and packed with information listeners could use to improve their mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a news feature report by RTHK’s Chinese News and Current Affairs team was also nominated for a radio award under the “Planet” category.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare secretary Chris Sun on Thursday said the elderly can showcase their talents through performing arts, as Hong Kong prepares to host its first festival to celebrate elderly artists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came as more than 100 performers aged up to 86 are set to take the stage at the "First Hong Kong Creative Ageing Arts Festival" next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also noted that Hong Kong's population is ageing, and urged all sectors to join hands and create an elderly-friendly culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 20 years time, every one in three people in Hong Kong will be aged 65 or above. We need to encourage more elderly to actively participate in society," Sun told an event to promote the festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope our creative ageing artists can showcase their abilities and skills to the community," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will feature more than 30 programmes including dance performances and art exhibitions starting from September 25 to October 6 at the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Lo Wai-fung was unable to beat the reigning Olympic champion Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the men’s Taekwondo 68kg category at the Paris Olympic Games on Thursday, but will have a chance of a bronze medal care of the repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Rashitov started off strong, beating Lo 12-0 in the first round with a series of kicks and punches. The Uzbek continued his lead into the second round, and while the 17th seeded SAR athlete was able to earn two points for a body kick, Rashitov ultimately came out victorious with a 9-2 win to reach the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rashitov went on to make it to the final, granting Lo entry to the repechage competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo and Liang Yushuai of China, who lost to the Uzbek in the quarterfinals, will fight each other in a repechage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner of the matchup, scheduled for 1.30am on Friday Hong Kong time, will fight another bout for a bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo is making history as the first teakwondo athlete to represent Hong Kong in the games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 75 prisoners have graduated from the Correctional Services Department's Ethics College, receiving diplomas in education.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Among the graduates was Tong Ying-kit, the first person charged under the National Security Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the graduation ceremony on Thursday, Tong reflected on his past, saying that he had been influenced by radical comments, misinformation and the social atmosphere at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was grateful for the education opportunities given to him, and expressed his desire to make positive contributions to society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang, who attended the ceremony, congratulated the graduates and said he was proud of their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the role of the college in guiding them towards a more constructive path in life and instilling in them the importance of upholding ethical values.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the event, Tang praised the achievements of Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong and expressed regret that some people targeted and criticised her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kong is supportive of the government and she condemns violence. I think the stance should be encouraged, and everyone should embrace that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong won gold in the individual epee event at the Paris Olympic Games and is joining the Hong Kong Jockey Club as an assistant external affairs manager.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group on Thursday said the sale of illegal cigarettes is becoming a more serious problem in Hong Kong, with free trial packets even handed out in the streets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group warned that such cigarettes could be harmful to health, because it's not clear what ingredients they contain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui Yuen, a member of the group, said he now sees promotional teams handing out free trial packets of illegal cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I run into them once or twice in Kwun Tong every week, there are no regulations! Where is the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Convener of the group Joe Lo said these promotional squads also encourage people to keep in contact with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Smokers are also invited to join the Telegram group to receive more promotional advertisements and to keep in contact," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also warned against a plan by the government to ban fruit-flavoured cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said a recent survey it carried out involving 297 people who smoked fruit-flavoured cigarettes found that two thirds would try to find illicit products if a ban came into effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Lo Wai-fung is heading into the round of 16 in the men’s Taekwondo -68kg category at the Paris Olympic Games, after beating Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in straight sets at the Grand Palais on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo began the first round of the qualification contest with a clean 14-0 sweep, earning nine points in the first minute for three head kicks. He then got two points for a body kick, followed by a three-point head kick to end round one with less than 20 seconds to spare. A round ends automatically if one contestant is ahead by 12 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ghotany fought back with a two-point kick to the body at the start of the second round, but Lo came back strong, leading to an intense exchange of blows in the first 30 seconds. The SAR athlete was able to continue with strong kicks to the head to once again pull away by 12 points, and won 16-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will face Uzbekistan’s Ulugbek Rashitov next for a place in the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they had foiled an attempt to smuggle 12 kilogrammes of gold, estimated to be worth HK$7.5 million, from Hong Kong to Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said an X-ray scan at the airport revealed gold hidden in parts of ozone generators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they suspect smugglers were trying to evade taxes of HK$800,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the third haul of smuggled gold to be intercepted by the authorities this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Society for Community Organization (SoCo) on Thursday called on the government to improve support for caregivers after a mother and son were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It's understood that the 60-year-old man died from an accident in the flat, while the 82-year-old bedridden woman died from a lack of care.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Yuen, a community organiser with Soco, said there is a lack of effort to identify high-risk families and inadequate emergency and temporary care support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said many carers do not know where to access support services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen stressed the need for proactive measures to support carers, noting that some older people with chronic illnesses are themselves forced to care for those even more vulnerable than themselves.

    Thousands join protests against racism in UK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There were anti-racism rallies in English cities including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765272_1_20240808110122.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets in several English cities on Wednesday to oppose days of far-right violence that have had UK police on high alert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nightly riots -- during which mosques and migrant-related facilities have been attacked -- have erupted across towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland fuelled by a wave of misinformation surrounding the murder of three children on July 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on Wednesday evening, it was anti-racism and anti-fascist counter-protesters who were out in greater numbers, holding rallies in cities up and down England including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whose streets? Our streets!" chanted protesters at a few-thousand-strong gathering in Walthamstow, northeast London, where some held banners saying "Stop the far right".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the borough and we don't want these people on our streets... they don't represent us," Sara Tresilian, 58, told AFP, referring to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have to turn out (and) give that message... I think it's important that you show up for your friends and neighbours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Valentine, the Met Police's deputy assistant commissioner, thanked "communities for coming together across the capital and for showing community spirit this evening".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sheffield, activists chanted "Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here," as riot police looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Birmingham, hundreds of anti-racism protesters gathered outside a migrant support centre, while in Brighton, around 2,000 people took part in a peaceful demonstration, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some friction, however, as in the southern town of Aldershot, where the PA reported police had to intervene between anti-racism activists and a group of people shouting "Stop the boats" -- a reference to migrants who reach Britain by crossing the English Channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had put 6,000 specialist police on standby to deal with the approximately 100 demonstrations by far-right activists and counter-protesters that were advertised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper thanked "all the police officers working tonight to protect & support local communities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Courts have started to order jail terms for offenders tied to the unrest as authorities seek to head off new troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disorder, Britain's worst since the 2011 London riots, has seen almost 430 people arrested and at least 120 charged, and has led several countries to issue travel warnings for the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence broke out after three girls aged nine, seven and six were killed and five more children critically injured during a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, northwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  False rumours initially spread on social media saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. The suspect was later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales. UK media reported that his parents are from Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rioting that followed has seen demonstrators throw bricks and flares at police officers, burn cars, and attack mosques and at least two hotels that have been used for asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned anyone involved will face "the full force of the law", including those inciting violence online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer, a former chief state prosecutor, has pledged "substantive sentencing before the end of this week" for rioters, and his government has freed up an extra 500 prison places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scores of accused, including teenagers, have already appeared before judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a man was jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder and assaulting a police officer in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other men received sentences of 20 months and 30 months for participating in violence in Liverpool on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest," said prosecutor Jonathan Egan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the disorder on figures associated with the now-defunct English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EDL founder Tommy Robinson has been accused by authorities of stoking tensions, and police in Cyprus, where he was reported to be on holiday, said on Wednesday they were ready to assist UK police if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Robinson later wrote on the X social media platform: "Lucky I'm not in Cyprus then".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK lawmakers have accused social media sites of fuelling the violence. Tech billionaire and X owner Elon Musk in particular has angered the government with a series of provocative tweets, including that a British "civil war is inevitable". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Texas man was executed on Wednesday for the 1997 murder of a woman who was jogging in her Houston neighbourhood, one of two executions scheduled this week in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Arthur Lee Burton, 54, was put to death via lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, and pronounced dead at 6:47 pm Central time, officials from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the western state of Utah is scheduled to carry out an execution overnight, its first in 14 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taberon Honie, 48, is to be put to death shortly after midnight Mountain Time (0600 GMT Thursday) for the 1998 murder and sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend's mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Honie is to be executed by lethal injection at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Utah's last execution was carried out by firing squad in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton, the death row inmate in Texas, was convicted of the July 1997 murder of Nancy Adleman, a mother of three who was attacked while out jogging. Adleman was strangled with her own shoelaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court to stay his execution but the request was denied without comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorneys had argued that Burton should be constitutionally exempt from being put to death because he is intellectually disabled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To all the people I have hurt and caused pain, I wish we didn't have to be here at this moment, but I want you to know that I am sorry for putting y'all through this," Burton said in his final statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including Burton, Texas has carried out three executions since January and there have been 11 in the United States this year so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 US states, while six others (Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee) have moratoriums in place. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lo Wai-fung will be competing in the qualification contest on Thursday at 3pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Being the first to do something is never easy, especially when you have the weight of an entire city on your shoulders, and Lo Wai-fung is going to do just that on Thursday with his Olympic Taekwondo debut at the age of 21.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo will be competing in the men’s under 68kg qualification contest at the Paris Olympics. This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am the first one. I am going into competition with the weight of over 100,000 Taekwondo enthusiasts in Hong Kong, so it's a mission. They all support me, whether they watch the competition on television or live. Their support is my motivation so I am very thankful for them,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since obtaining his spot at the Paris Games in May, the Taekwondo athlete has undergone training at camps overseas. Lo also watched the first day of Taekwondo action on Wednesday to observe the referees in preparation for his own match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When I first stepped into the competition venue, I was very excited but also nervous. I'm excited because I get to compete in the world’s largest sporting event. I'm also nervous because I’ve never competed in such a large-scale competition before,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There's a lot of pressure with so many spectators watching me, but I will turn that into my motivation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will first take on Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in a qualification contest at 3pm Hong Kong time on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’ve never competed against the Refugee Olympic Team representative before, but I’ve watched him fight in YouTube videos, and he is always prepared in how he combats and what technique to use when he competes. I’ve only ever watched him in videos, so I won’t know his actual speed and strength until I go up against him. I won’t underestimate him,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Lo beats Al Ghotany, he will once again face world number six Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. The Uzbek beat Lo at the same stage at the Hangzhou Asian Games, where he ended up taking gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew this opponent was famous at the time, so I didn’t think too much and just focused on combat. You need to give it your all when you step on the stage. Though I lost in the end, I did reflect on the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I asked myself if the gap with this opponent was really that big. If I work harder, I wonder if I can lessen the gap now in competition, and even win.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Grand Palais has been transformed to host the Taekwondo events, after the historic venue hosted fencing.

    US stocks finish lower as rally loses steam

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765247_1_20240808055746.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday after an early rally petered out, in a sign of lingering unease after recent equity market weakness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is what happens when you have a big risk-off type of event," Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers, said of Monday's equity market plunge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's normal to see the market display uncertainty," said Sosnick, who pointed to a poorly received US Treasury bond auction as further evidence of investor angst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 38,763.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,199, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.1 percent to 16,195.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices sank more than 2.5 percent on Monday amid worries over a potential US recession and the unwinding of the so-called "carry trade" that took advantage of the weak yen prior to last week's interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many analysts expect more effects from the unwinding, extending a period of volatility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney fell 4.5 percent despite reporting better than expected earnings as investors digested commentary that a weakening of demand in the parks business "could impact the next few quarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbnb slumped 13.4 percent after reporting lower than expected profits and cautioning of "some signs of slowing demand from US guests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TripAdvisor also fell sharply after earnings, tumbling 16.7 percent. (AFP)

 China's weightlifters and swimmers were in the spotlight on day 12 of the Paris Olympics as the national team sealed a further three gold medals.

   Reigning champion Hou Zhihui produced a stunning comeback on the final attempt of the evening to retain her 49kg weightlifting title. Mihaela Cambei of Romania thought she had gold in the bag after registering 112kg in the clean and jerk, extending her advantage over Hou to 6kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With her back against the wall, Hou had to clear 117kg on her last attempt – 1kg more than her own Olympic record. She completed the clean, then, as the crowd held its breath, mustered just enough energy to execute the jerk.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There was heartbreak for British fans as Matthew Hudson-Smith was pipped at the line in the men's 400m final, with American Quincy Hall storming to a maiden gold on his Olympic debut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A four-time European champion, Hudson-Smith was the favourite heading into the race, after clocking the fastest time of the year just three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London 2012 winner Kirani James was also in resurgent form, running 43.78 seconds in the semi-final to lead everyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 31-year-old could only watch the podium fight in front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hudson-Smith was the first one to exit the final bend, but with the finish line within reach Hall charged into the lead and won in a personal best of 43.40 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Briton nearly lost his silver to Muzala Samukonga, the Zambian who came back only three-tenths of a second behind Hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the track, Morocco's Soufiane El Bakkali became the first man in nearly a century to win back-to-back 3,000m steeplechase gold medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The feat didn't come easy as the trio on the podium were separated by less than half a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over in the field, Jamaica's Roje Stona claimed an unlikely victory in the men's discus throw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He edged out Lithuania's Mykolas Alekna, who broke his father Virgiljus' Olympic record before Stona extended the mark further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Australia's Nina Kennedy dethroned American defending champion Katie Moon in the women's pole vault after clearing 4.90m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was 5cm higher than both Moon and Canada's Alysha Newman, who got bronze.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the centre of a gender dispute at the Paris Olympics, moved a step closer to the Olympic title when she beat Turkey's Esra Yildiz by unanimous decision in the women's featherweight semi-finals on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin, twice world champion, and Algerian boxer Imane Khelif have been in the spotlight at the Olympics over a gender row that has dominated headlines and been the subject of much discussion on social media platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, who is looking to clinch Chinese Taipei's first Olympic title in boxing, faces Poland's Julia Szeremeta in the final on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The feeling of entering the gold-medal match is one of gratitude to myself for making it this far," Lin told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin and Khelif were disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) from the 2023 World Championships in New Delhi, with the body saying in a press conference on Monday that a gender test had ruled both of them ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two boxers are competing in the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organising the boxing in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At these Games, the IOC is using boxing eligibility rules that were applied at the 2016 and 2021 Olympics which do not include gender testing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin used her longer reach to keep her Turkish opponent at bay, landing several jabs, but Yildiz would not back down and tried to break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having lost the first two rounds, the Turk went all in during the last one and landed a right hook, but it was too little, too late to turn the tide in a one-sided affair. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China claimed a second weightlifting gold of the night in dramatic fashion on Thursday morning, as reigning champion Hou Zhihui produced a stunning comeback on the final attempt of the evening to retain her 49kg title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mihaela Cambei of Romania put herself on pole position after clearing 93kg in the snatch, 4kg more than her Chinese opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cambei then thought she had gold in the bag after registering 112kg in the clean and jerk, extending her advantage over Hou to 6kg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With her back against the wall, Hou had to clear 117kg on her last attempt – 1kg more than her own Olympic record set in Tokyo three years ago – to leapfrog Cambei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed the clean, then, as the crowd held its breath, mustered just enough energy to execute the jerk, pushing the barbell high above her head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old pumped her fists in the air and let out a victorious roar as her lift was confirmed, while Cambei gracefully congratulated her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bronze went to Surodchana Khambao of Thailand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Guo Qing took silver for China in the women's 49kg taekwondo in the early hours of Thursday, losing to Panipak Wongpattanakit of Thailand in the Olympic final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guo opened strongly in the final at the Grand Palais, scoring an early head kick before conceding a penalty point, or gam-jeom, and kicks to the head and the body, losing the first round 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese athlete made more of a contest of it in the second round, scoring with a punch and a body kick but conceding two gam-jeom to take a 3-2 win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Knowing that any mistake could cost them the title, the two fighters started the final two-minute period cautiously, with the first score coming Panipak's way with just 29 seconds left, care of a head kick adjudicated by video replay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen seconds later, the Thai athlete did the same again, scoring another kick to the head care of a video ruling. Two gam-jeom late in the round put Guo on the scoreboard, but there was no way back for China's representative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's more taekwondo interest on Thursday, when Lo Wai-fung becomes the first athlete to represent Hong Kong, China in the sport. He's in men’s under 68kg action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's synchronised swimmers have made history in the pool in the early hours of Thursday, as they put on a dominant performance on the final day of competition to secure their first-ever gold medal at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The national team were already runaway leaders after the first two routines which took place in the past two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the silver medallists in Tokyo had everything to lose coming into the last performance, the acrobatic routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going last out of 10 teams, the octet of Chang Hao, Feng Yu, Wang Qianyi, Wang Ciyue, Wang Liuyi, Xiang Binxuan, Xiao Yanning and Zhang Yayi once again finished first on 283.6934 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That pushed their accumulative score to 996.1389 points, near 82 ahead of the United States and 95 in front of Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That broke a two-decade stronghold by Russia, as the six-time defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the conflict with Ukraine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team will play for a first ever Olympic gold medal after a shock 3-2 shoot-out victory against Belgium on Wednesday, following a 1-1 draw in regulation time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The national team, whose only previous medal at the Olympics came on home astroturf in 2008, looked bound for the final for much of the game, with Zou Meirong putting them ahead from a penalty corner in the 18th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belgians, who had beaten China at the group stage, put the pressure on and finally equalised a minute before the end of regulation though Emma Puvrez from another penalty corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drama was to follow in the shoot-out ... in which five players are given eight seconds to run at goal and attempt to score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen Yang saw her attempt saved, allowing the Belgians to take an early lead, but three saves by goalkeeper Ye Jiao gave China victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, who finished only fourth in their group, had already stunned Australia with a 3-2 victory in the quarter final. They'll take on the Netherlands, another giant of the sport, in the final at 2am on Saturday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands beat China 3-0 in group play, where China had also lost to the Belgians.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia won a thrilling men's team pursuit final against Britain at the National Velodrome on Wednesday to claim their first Olympic gold medal in the track highlight since 2004.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The teams were neck-and-neck throughout the 16-lap duel with Australians Oliver Bleddyn, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien always fractionally ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was still in the balance as the bell rang for the final lap but calamity struck as Britain's Ethan Hayter appeared to slip and lost momentum, sending them out of formation to allow Australia to gain sweet revenge for past defeats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just so proud of the team I'm a part of," O'Brien told reporters. "It's an absolute honour to share the track with those guys, and even more so when you come away with gold."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy, the champions from Tokyo, easily beat Denmark to take the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States won the women's team pursuit gold for the first time when they beat New Zealand in the final with Britain taking the bronze medal by beating Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World records continued to tumble earlier on day three of track action with Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen again showing why he is regarded as the best track sprinter of his generation with an incredible 200 metres flying lap to top the time sheets in qualification for the track cycling sprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Matthew Richardson initially broke the world record set by Trinidad & Tobago's Paul Nicholas in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richardson clocked 9.091 seconds to beat Nicholas's mark of 9.100 set at high altitude in Bolivia but he could not celebrate for long as the 27-year-old Lavreysen, fresh from his team sprint gold on Tuesday, clocked 9.088, averaging 79kph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lavreysen, nicknamed The Beast, is going for three golds at the Paris Games and is favourite for the sprint and keirin. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Li Fabin on Wednesday defended his Olympic gold in the men’s 61kg weightlifting, boosting his chances with a new Olympic record in the snatch category.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li lifted a combined 310 kg at the South Paris Arena, slightly lower than his record of 313 kg at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That’s 7 kg more than Thailand’s Theerapong Silachai in second place, and 12 kg more than Hampton Morris from the US who took bronze and holds the world record for the clean and jerk category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li successfully lifted 137kg, 140kg and 143kg in the snatch event, with the third lift setting a new Olympic record.

  <br/>
  The 31 year old's attempt to clean and jerk 172kg, to equal his own Olympic record from Tokyo, fell narrowly short, with Li buckling as the weights reached his chest. He settled for the 167kg he managed on his second attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first weightlifting gold and the 23rd gold overall for the national team at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A preseason friendly between Kitchee and Atletico Madrid ended with the visitors winning 6-1, in a game that brought smiles to the faces of local football fans with star names playing, and a lot of goals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atletico took the lead in the 6th minute with a goal from striker Alexander Sorloth, who's shot hit the left post before going in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sorloth scored again in the 7th minute straight from kickoff with a lob.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kitchee did regroup and were able to even out the competition a bit, but in the second half, there were more goals with the Spanish side's Carlos Martin tapping in from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in the 61st minute, Santiago Mourino scored Atletico's fourth goal with a header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, in the 67th minute, Kitchee scored – Sherzod Temirov smashed home with a drive inside the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the goals from Atletico kept on coming with Adrian Nino and Thomas Lemar scoring before the match ended.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Poland’s Aleksandra Miroslaw on Wednesday climbed her way to the top to become the first-ever gold medallist in women’s speed climbing, one of the quickest events at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Miroslaw, who is already the world record holder, had a clean run up the 15-metre wall to beat Deng Lijuan of China in the big final for gold with a time of 6.10 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deng also had an impressive run to earn the silver medal with her personal best time of 6.18 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miroslaw’s teammate Aleksandra Kalucka secured the bronze after beating Indonesia's Rajiah Sallsabillah in the small final with a time of 6.53.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sport climbing was first introduced at the Tokyo Games, where athletes had to participate in all three events – speed, bouldering and lead – for a chance to win a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport returned to the Paris Games in a new format with speed being a standalone event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday booked semi-final places in both men's and women's team table tennis at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's national team took on South Korea in the last eight at South Paris Arena 4, a day after brushing aside India in the round of 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the opening doubles match, Ma Long and Wang Chuqin dominated the South Korean pair of Cho Dae-seong and Jang Woo-jin, winning 11-5, 11-9, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ensuing singles match, Fan Zhendong and Lim Jong-hoon split the first two games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan, who struck gold in the singles contest, then went on to win 11-9, 11-6, putting China up 2-0 in the best-of-five quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Jang then squared off in the next singles match, which went back and forth before Wang pulled through for a 3-1 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China won 3-0 and will take on France in the semi-finals on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar result in the women's draw, where Chen Meng, Wang Manyu and Sun Yingsha comfortably saw off Chinese Taipei 3-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded trio did not drop a single game against Chen Szu-Yu, Chien Tung-Chuan and Cheng I-Ching, as they move one step closer to defending their Tokyo title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They take on South Korea in the semi-finals on Thursday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 About 40 percent of students taking part in this year's Joint University Programmes Admissions System (Jupas) on Wednesday received offers from local universities, a figure that's in line with previous years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 40,000 students joined the centralised admissions scheme, and more than 15,700 of them were given an offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong said it admitted four of the 10 top scorers in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam, as well as eight top athletes through the Top Athletes Direct Admission Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them is Chloe Pak, who holds the Hong Kong U18 and U20 records in 100m hurdles as well as the Hong Kong record in 4x200m relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pak will be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People think that studying and training may not co-exist, but I definitely do not think this is an issue, because it really depends on the person and their attitude," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese University, meanwhile, admitted five top DSE scorers who will all be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another top DSE scorer will pursue a degree in business at the University of Science and Technology.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Wednesday dismissed a carer's claim that a negative culture at the residential home she worked at led to her abusing at least 22 of the children there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu Wing-sin, 46, was one of 34 caregivers charged in connection with a spate of child abuse at the Children's Residential Home in Prince Edward three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pleaded guilty to 49 counts of abuse, with the District Court told she hit children with a shoe and kicked them in the head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as citing a negative culture at the home run by the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children, the defence said Chiu had been praised by parents and senior colleagues during her more than 20 years of experience in childcare and had suffered depression and suicidal thoughts following the abuse incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, judge Lily Wong rejected the mitigation plea and severely criticised Chiu for her actions, saying she "beat up the children every day she went to work".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge questioned why Chiu did not take action or resign from her position if she disagreed with the practices at the centre, instead of participating in the abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was adjourned until September 20 for sentencing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of people queued up on Wednesday to visit Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery before it opened at 10am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Located on the second floor of the Hong Kong Museum of History, the gallery is the city's first thematic exhibition dedicated to promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman at the front of the queue said that as a Chinese person, she should know more about national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She expressed concern about the limited sense of national identity among Hong Kong's youth compared with their mainland counterparts, and stressed the need for more education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child accompanied by his grandmother said he wanted to explore issues beyond what he had learned at school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to learn more about Chinese history and law, which we did not learn much about in school," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,100-square-metre gallery is divided into six different zones, including a theatre that shows a short video about modern Chinese history and emphasises the importance of national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has called for a wide range of visitors to the gallery.

    Cathay declares interim dividend despite profit drop

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Wednesday announced an interim dividend due to its strong performance in the first six months of 2024, despite reporting a drop in first-half profit from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm added that a decrease in profit for its airlines and subsidiaries was "principally attributable to the normalisation of ticket prices".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group recorded a 14 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our strong performance for the first six months of the year was primarily driven by the ongoing robust demand for travel, and the solid performance of our cargo business," said the airline's chairman Patrick Healy in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This result has allowed us to announce a first interim dividend payment to ordinary shareholders of HK$0.20 per ordinary share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay's budget arm, HK Express, reported a loss of HK$73 million in the first half of the year, following earnings of HK$333 million in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said the low-cost carrier had been facing engine issues and regional competition, but he remained confident in the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of those aircraft are on ground and not being able to generate revenue for HK Express in the short term," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second issue HK Express is facing short-term, is the very keen competition among short-haul carriers based in Hong Kong, as well as the foreign low-cost carriers flying into Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Healy said the company is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic flight levels within the first quarter of 2025 as it enters "the final stretch" of its rebuilding journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are increasing our group headcount by 5,000 to a total of 29,000 people by the end of this year to support this pace of growth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline had also bought back HK$19.5 billion in preference shares acquired by the government as part of a bailout package to stay afloat, and said it would continue to maintain a lower level of liquidity than it did during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of its fleet, Cathay said it would buy 30 Airbus A330-900 wide-body aircraft, with an option to purchase 30 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not disclose the purchase price but said it received "significant price concessions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The basic price is about US$11 billion, or roughly HK$85.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These new regional wide-body aircraft are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will join the Cathay Pacific fleet, principally serving destinations in Asia. We now have more than 100 new-generation aircraft in our delivery pipeline, with the rights to acquire 80 additional aircraft in future," Healy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purchase of Airbus aircraft is part of an investment drive of more than HK$100 billion over the next seven years, which also includes newly designed lounges and cabin products.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Growth in China's exports slowed last month while imports returned to the black, customs data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Exports were up 7 percent in July year on year after posting an 8.6 percent increase the month before, the strongest rise in 15 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's figure was the weakest since April.

  For the first seven months of the year taken together, exports rose 6.7 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, rose at a robust 7.2 percent last month, compared with a 2.3 percent contraction in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's imports growth was the fastest in three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports climbed 5.4 percent in the January-July period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus narrowed to US$84.65 billion in July from US$99.05 billion in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, the trade surplus expanded by 7.9 percent year on year to US$518 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns remained for the world's second-largest economy after second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent from 5.3 percent in the January-March period, keeping alive calls for policymakers to roll out more support to reach the government's full-year growth target of around 5 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Wednesday urged the government to ensure proper use of public funds as the city's healthcare voucher scheme for the elderly is further expanded to include more mainland medical institutions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong residents aged 65 and above receive HK$2,000 vouchers each year to spend on private healthcare services. From next Wednesday, these vouchers will be accepted at seven facilities in the Greater Bay Area, up from four at present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca Chan, chairwoman of Legco's health services panel, said during an RTHK programme that the government should act as a gatekeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There shouldn't be any possibility of reselling the vouchers or using them for other purposes, such as just buying [medical] products.... The government needs to act as a gatekeeper, perhaps through inspections. They should also look at how to deal with reports of illegal use," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Siu, who manages a mainland service provider covered by the voucher scheme, highlighted the growing trend of Hong Kong residents, especially the elderly, seeking medical services across the border. About one in five of his clients are from Hong Kong, a number he expects to increase after the scheme is further expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the expansion could help ease the strain on Hong Kong's medical system, adding that his firm plans to hire more Cantonese-speaking staff to meet the growing demand.

    Rower thanks family support for strong finish in Paris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rower Chiu Hin-chun, a two-time SAR Olympian who made history with his performance at the Paris Games, said he wants to thank his family for supporting his career over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu was ranked 20th overall in Paris, the best result for himself and a male Hong Kong rower at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished fourth in his heat in the preliminary round at the Paris Games, and had to go through the repechage to advance to the next stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the heat, I keep asking myself if anything I can squeeze more to not get caught by the Hungarian athlete. And after that, I told myself I already gave my 100 percent in the heat so there's no regrets,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking on five Olympic races in just a week, Chiu said the biggest challenge was to recover both mentally and physically in a short period of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have to think [about] how to recover, what else I have to eat so I can recover faster. In the middle of the race, I feel very tired and [have] to adjust my [mentality] to prepare for the next race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a lightweight rower competing in the open category, he admitted it’s not easy to take on Europeans who are larger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with a bright smile, the 29-year-old said family support kept him going until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially like this time, they come to Paris and they have to walk through like the 2km courses from the start to the finish to the spectator stage to watch my race, and then go back to the start again, and to take the bus and go back to the hotel,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Normally people have their family trip [elsewhere], and our family trip is watching my race. So it is really special for us,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Formerly a windsurfer, Chiu found his place on the flat water because of the satisfaction it brought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In rowing, we have a quote, it’s ‘mileage makes champions’. So when I changed to rowing, I [was] very satisfied with my performance and also the achievements can keep pushing me to the other level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who won a World Cup gold medal in Switzerland just before Paris, will fly to Canada next for the World Rowing Championships from August 18 to 25.

 The Hong Kong market opened stronger on Wednesday, taking its cue from Wall Street, which partially rebounded from a sell-off in the previous session.

  The Hang Seng Index was up 37.44 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,684.78.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland's Kellie Harrington has retained her Olympic title, beating China's top seed Yang Wenlu in a much-anticipated gold medal bout.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The women's 60kg showdown took place in front of a raucous crowd inside Court Phillipe Chatrier at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harrington got off to a good start, taking the first round when four of five judges ruled in her favour. Yang tried to respond but lost round two 4-1 on the cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the verge of victory, Harrington turned defensive in the final round, looking to run down the clock instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her tactic worked, as she won by a 4-1 split decision to become the first Irishwoman to win back-to-back Olympic golds. The 34-year-old amateur boxer was in tears as her victory was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the ring, Algeria's Imane Khelif remains on course for a gold medal after ousting Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand on 5-0 unanimous decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khelif, who was disqualified by the now-suspended International Boxing Association last year after failing gender tests, will take on China's Yang Liu in the women's 66kg final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang advanced after beating Chinese Taipei's Chen Nien-chin by a split decision of 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot Wu Yu also progressed to the women's 50kg gold medal bout, after the top seed defeated Kazakhstan's Nazym Kyzaibay.

    US stocks rebound after three days of losses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday after three straight days of losses, with analysts pointing to bargain hunting and US bond markets bouncing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gains in New York also followed a quieter day in most overseas stock markets and came as Caterpillar and Uber reported solid earnings, lifting shares of both companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful that we'll get some stability back," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that there could still be "a little more downside risks to the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.8 percent at 38,997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,240, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 1.0 percent to 16,366.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices fell more than 2.5 percent on Monday in a move seen as a reflection of worries about a US recession following Friday's disappointing jobs data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market watchers have also pointed to ripple effects from Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and have led to liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei, which slumped 12.4 percent on Monday, jumped 10.2 percent on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reversal in the US equity market came as US Treasury bond yields climbed and as a closely-watched volatility index retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Caterpillar gained 3.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as strong pricing offset the hit from lower revenues. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Netherlands proved once again they only have themselves to beat, shaving fractions off their own record time not once, but twice on Tuesday evening in Paris to retain their track cycling team sprint gold medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trio of Jeffrey Hoogland, Harrie Lavreysen and Roy van den Berg edged Great Britain's Jack Carlin, Ed Lowe and Hamish Turnbull by more than eight-tenths of a second to clinch victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch threw down the gauntlet on their opponents after setting a record-breaking time of 41.191 seconds in the heat. They also owned the previous best of 41.225 seconds achieved in February 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That fresh record stood for less than an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They eclipsed the 41-second barrier with a gold-winning time of 40.949 seconds in the final. Australia denied France a podium finish in the bronze medal race earlier, while China finished seventh.

 Diving again took centre stage for Team China on day 11 of the Paris Olympics, with a teenage star of the national team clinching a second gold of the games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However the nation fell to second in the medal table behind the United States, with 22 golds to 24 for the Americans, after losing in wrestling and boxing finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No Hong Kong, China athletes were in action. The SAR remains 21st in the medal table.

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Cole Hocker delivered one of the all-time Olympic shocks when he won the 1,500 metres gold with a stunning finish to blast past world champion Josh Kerr as defending champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen faded to fourth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The race had been billed as a showdown between Ingebrigtsen and Kerr and the Norwegian set a hot pace as he led coming into the last 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briton Kerr, just as he did in last year’s world championships, surged past him and looked set for victory, only for Hocker to find a way through on the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His winning time of three minutes 27.65 was an Olympic record and a massive personal best by more than three seconds. Kerr posted a national record 3:27.79 and Yared Nuguse took bronze for the US in another huge pb of 3:27.80.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ingebrigtsen finished fourth in a time faster than his Olympic record set in Tokyo, but the double world champion over 5,000m has another shot at a medal as he goes in the heats over that distance on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Gabby Thomas finally claimed the global title she has promised for so long when she delivered a dominant performance to take Olympic 200 metres gold, denying silver medallist Julien Alfred a sprint double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, 27, took bronze in Tokyo and silver in last year’s world championships, but she was in control throughout the final, coming home in 21.83 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alfred, who claimed Saint Lucia’s first Olympic medal when she won the 100m on Saturday, was a clear second in 22.08, with Brittany Brown taking bronze for the US in 20.20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's Zhao Jie claimed bronze in the women's hammer throw, behind Camryn Rogers, who won gold for Canada, and Annette Echikunwoke of the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Miltiadis Tentoglou retained the gold medal in the men's long jump. Jamaican Wayne Pinnock took silver and Italy's Mattia Furlani claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bahrain's Winfred Yavi won the women's 3,000 metres steeplechase. Uganda's Peruth Chemutai took silver and Kenya's Faith Cherotich claimed bronze. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kenichiro Fumita becomes the first Japanese Greco-Roman wrestler to win an Olympic gold in four decades. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765065_1_20240807023848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of a first-ever men's wrestling gold were dashed early on Wednesday as Cao Liguo was beaten by Japan's Kenichiro Fumita in the 60kg Greco-Roman final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile there was history in the 130kg Greco-Roman final, when Cuban wrestler Mijain Lopez became the first athlete to win five consecutive individual gold medals in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita won by a cumulative score of 4-1 over two periods, and led from start to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao requested a challenge out of desperation as time expired, but the judge ruled the result would stand and the 25-year-old Guangxi native had to settle for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zholaman Sharshenbekov of Kazakhstan and North Korean Ri Se-ung earlier took bronze in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has only two Olympic wrestling golds, with the last one coming in 2008 when Wang Jiao clinched the women's 72kg freestyle. Since then the team has racked up three silvers and four bronzes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita, meanwhile, becomes the first Japanese entrant to win a Greco-Roman gold since 1984.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 130kg final, Lopez, who turns 42 in two weeks' time, defeated Chile's Yasmani Acosta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his victory, Lopez broke a tie for four successive individual Olympic golds he shared with Carl Lewis (athletics/long jump), Michael Phelps (swimming/200m medley), Katie Ledecky (swimming/800m freestyle), Al Oerter (athletics/discus), Paul Elvstrom (sailing) and Kaori Icho (wrestling).

    Harris picks 'real deal' governor Walz as running mate

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris said on Tuesday she was "proud" to tap Tim Walz as her running mate, opting for the Minnesota governor with blue-collar credentials as the partner most likely to boost her historic White House bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walz had been on a vice-presidential shortlist with a string of other Democratic figures seen as broadening Harris's appeal as she sprints into the contest against Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming to make history as the first woman US president, Harris, already a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, has little time before Election Day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud to announce that I've asked Tim Walz to be my running mate," she posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden quickly expressed support for his deputy's "great decision" to choose Walz, saying the duo "will be a powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket and help win over working-class, white, male voters, a demographic that propelled Trump to victory in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner, decades of military experience and a rural perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dismisses the "nonsense" of Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance, and he is also a gun-owner who tweets about hunting, goes ice-fishing and rides rollercoasters with his daughter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The onetime teacher and school sports coach flipped a Republican district in 2006 to win a seat in the House of Representatives in a state seen as light years from the coastal elites of California, Harris's home turf, or the East Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Walz will appeal to the left for championing cannabis legalization, worker protections, abortion rights, and tighter firearm restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's campaign branded the Minnesotan as a "dangerously liberal extremist" seeking to impose California values on the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic grandee Nancy Pelosi swatted such criticism aside, telling MSNBC that Walz "is right down the middle. He's a heartland of America Democrat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz earned enthusiastic endorsements from Democratic liberals as well as centrists like Senator Joe Manchin, who called him "the real deal." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's teenage sensation Quan Hongchan comfortably defended her diving gold in the 10 metre platform, fending off teammate Chen Yuxi who took silver while Kim Mi-rae of North Korea rounded up the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That marked a second gold medal for 17-year-old Quan in Paris, having clinched the 10 metre synchronised platform title with Chen earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China remains on track for a clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Games, clinching five so far, with three more up for grabs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performing last out of the 12 finalists, Quan showed composure and led after each of the five rounds for a wire-to-wire victory. She couldn't replicate her Olympic record of 466.2 points set in Tokyo, finishing with 425.6 this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By comparison, Chen accumulated 420.7 points, and 372.1 for Kim. The North Korean clinched her country's first Olympic medal in an individual diving event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The youngest Olympian in Paris, 11-year-old Zheng Haohao from China, had a strong first run in the women's park skateboarding preliminaries on Tuesday, but that wasn't enough for her to advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng had an opening score of 63.19 with a clean run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she fell in her second and third runs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each competitor had three runs, and their ranking is determined by the highest score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The score of 63.19 placed Zheng 18th out of 22 athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian teenage skateboarding sensation Arisa Trew won the Olympic gold, edging out Japan's Cocona Hiraki in silver and Britain's injured Sky Brown in bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trew, 14, in her trademark pink helmet, nailed a high-risk and high-speed final round to leap to the top of the rankings, bringing some of the crowd to their feet at a sun-drenched Place de la Concorde stadium. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday urged Hongkongers planning to travel to the United Kingdom, or those who are already there, to be careful given the ongoing protests and riots there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber outbound travel alert – the lowest in a three-tier warning system – is currently in effect for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means there are signs of threat and people visiting should "monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation and asked any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or reach out to the Chinese Embassy in the UK.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's volleyball team on Tuesday crashed out of the Paris Olympics, suffering a 3-2 defeat to Turkey in a nail-biting quarter-final clash at South Paris Arena 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China, who are three-time Olympic champions, claimed the first set 25-23 before dropping the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took the fourth set to force a tie-breaker, but fell short 15-12 in the deciding fifth set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Melissa Teresa Vargas scored 42 points to lead the Turkish women to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was tied 11-all in the fifth set before a smash of Vargas and a spiking error from Wu Mengjie of China pushed Turkey up 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gong Xiangyu had a smash to pull China within 13-12, but another kill of Vargas and a smart play of Elif Sahin – who replaced injured starting setter Cansu Ozbay in the last three sets – sealed the victory for the Turkish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Vargas played a great game," said China head coach Cai Bin. "We tried our best to stop her, but could not do that well enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey next face Serbia or Italy in the semi-finals. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Tuesday called for improvements to public facilities for breastfeeding.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The body said a survey of 1,000 breastfeeding mothers found 81 percent were unhappy with the facilities available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Complaints included an insufficient number of babycare and lactation rooms, and small sizes and poor hygiene conditions when it comes to some of those that are available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The conditions of these facilities will directly affect whether women choose to breastfeed or express milk in public places, and may even become barriers to breastfeeding," said EOC Executive Director Ferrick Chu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 90 percent of the survey respondents said they thought shopping centres should provide more breastfeeding or expressing facilities, while over 80 percent thought commercial and government premises should improve the hygiene standards of their facilities, the EOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission said the government should ensure an even distribution of breastfeeding facilities across different areas of the city and provide incentives for premises to establish and maintain high-quality facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Breastfeeding is not just a mother's responsibility, it also affects the growth and development of the next generation. All sectors of society have a duty to create a favourable environment for breastfeeding mothers," said EOC Chairwoman Linda Lam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Tuesday called on Hong Kong's business sector to make proactive efforts to understand, respond and embrace changes, during a session studying a letter by President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a recent reply letter to Hong Kong entrepreneurs with family ties to Ningbo, Xi urged them to leverage their strengths and contribute to Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, was quoted as saying that society, especially the business sector, should take the president's words as a guide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, who heads Beijing's liaison office in the SAR, noted that the letter was not only an encouragement for the entrepreneurs, but also expressed Xi's high hopes for the entire business community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR should act as the protagonist, actively participating in the torrent of further comprehensively deepening reforms. It should not be a bystander, but be someone who's involved," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong should fully grasp areas that should be maintained and remain unchanged, areas that should be changed, and areas where it should take the lead in making a change."
