<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says airport officials followed their contingency procedures to handle an emergency that closed a runway for hours on Monday, with a plane operator asked to submit a report to the authorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of flights were delayed after a cargo plane experienced a flat tyre during an emergency landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive on Tuesday said the authorities kept the public informed, made alternative transport and flight arrangements, and brought in extra manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the plane's operator has been told to submit a report on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am a believer that, for any matter, there's always room for improvement. I'm glad that the incident was handled safely. That is the most important principle in any emergency incident, that's the number one priority," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will scrutinise reports and see whether any extra action can be taken by the airline, by the [Airport Authority] and other parties concerned."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that similar incidents could be dealt with more efficiently in the future when the airport's third runway is fully in operation at the end of this year.

 Several North Korean soldiers working near the heavily fortified border with the South were wounded in a landmine explosion, the Yonhap News Agency said Tuesday, citing Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korean military suffered multiple casualties due to a mine explosion during work," it said, without giving further details. The border between the two countries is heavily mined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's military said the explosions came after dozens of North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the border but retreated after Seoul's military fired warning shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the second such incursion in two weeks. (AFP)

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757878_1_20240618083506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka and three-time Grand Slam runner up Ons Jabeur say they will not compete at this year's Paris Olympics in order to prioritise their health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Especially with all the struggles I've been struggling with the last months, I feel I have to take care of my health," Sabalenka told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tennis events at this summer's Games take place on clay between July 27-August 4, meaning a switch back to clay immediately after the grass season and before the hard-court run up to the U.S. Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belarus' Sabalenka, 26, lost to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the French Open quarter-finals earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is set to return to action this week in Berlin, having suffered from a stomach illness at Roland-Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was the worst experience I had in my life on court," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tunisian Jabeur, 29, underwent surgery last year on her right knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After consulting with my medical team regarding attending to the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeapordize the rest of my season," Jabeur said on her social media accounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Olympics," she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Otago Highlanders back Connor Garden-Bachop has died aged 25 after an unspecified "medical event", New Zealand Rugby said Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Connor passed away on Monday following a medical event, and rugby's collective focus at this time is on supporting his family," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement without giving further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, the son of former All Black Stephen Bachop, played for the Highlanders in this season's Super Rugby competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winger, who also played representative rugby for the Maori All Blacks, comes from a family of New Zealand internationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His mother, Susan Garden-Bachop, played for New Zealand's Black Ferns, while his uncle Graeme Bachop also played for the All Blacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, who was the father of twin girls, made his debut for the Highlanders in 2021, going on to make 30 appearances in Super Rugby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had said he was one of several players not returning next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent post on social media platform Instagram, Garden-Bachop praised the Dunedin-based team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you @highlandersteam for an unforgettable five years," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to everyone in the south for making me feel at home, and thank you to the boys I have been honoured to share the field with, it's been a pleasure, I will miss you all. Till next time." (AFP)

    Mbappe breaks nose as France win Euro 2024 opener

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kylian Mbappe leaves the pitch with what turned out to be a broken nose. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757872_1_20240618064027.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe came off late on with a broken nose as France edged Austria 1-0 in their opening game at Euro 2024 on Monday, after Slovakia inflicted a surprise 1-0 defeat on Belgium and Romania beat Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France, the runners-up at the 2022 World Cup, are one of the standout contenders for European Championship glory in Germany, but they did not entirely convince against a hard-running Austria side and needed a Maximilian Woeber own goal to claim the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defender Woeber diverted Mbappe's cutback into his own net seven minutes before half-time in Duesseldorf to decide the Group D game and leave France level on three points at the top of the section with the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe may have made the goal, but it was otherwise a difficult night for the new Real Madrid signing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was denied twice by Austrian goalkeeper Patrick Pentz in the first half and failed to hit the target from a glorious chance when sent clean through 10 minutes after the restart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe then had to come off in the 90th minute after being left with a bloodied nose in an accidental collision with Austrian defender Kevin Danso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source close to the France captain confirmed shortly after the game that his nose was broken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium may no longer rank among the leading contenders but they were not expected to start with a defeat against Slovakia in Frankfurt, where Ivan Schranz of Slavia Prague scored the only goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schranz struck in the seventh minute, firing home the rebound after Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels had saved from Juraj Kucka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an especially frustrating day for Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku, who missed a host of chances and had a late equaliser controversially disallowed by VAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had already had one effort ruled out for a marginal offside call before he swept home a Lois Openda cutback in the 86th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, however, the goal was disallowed because the ball had brushed Openda's hand at the beginning of the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania won at a major international tournament for the first time in 24 years as they beat Ukraine 3-0 with the help of two errors from goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Nicolae Stanciu's magnificent long-range strike – following a misplaced Lunin clearance – gave Romania, backed by the vast majority of the Munich crowd, a first-half lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Razvan Marin's shot from distance then skipped under Lunin as Romania turned the screw with two more goals before the hour, Denis Dragus tapping home the third. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks began the week on a strong note, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finishing at records spurred on by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq led the major indices, climbing 1.0 percent to 17,857, a closing record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones climbed 0.5 percent to 38,778, while the S&P 500 also finished at an all-time high, rising 0.8 percent to 5,473.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not a broad rally but it's a rally with the index up for sure," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, who pointed to recent share price gains of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia as a source of momentum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan also noted that the outlook for US monetary policy had improved somewhat following last week's US inflation data, which kept alive the chance of interest rate cuts in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's calendar includes the release of US retail sales data, as well a Bank of England policy meeting.

  Among individual companies, Boeing advanced 0.7 percent as markets look ahead to Tuesday's hearing in the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into the aviation giant's safety problems.

  GameStop slumped 12.1 percent on disappointment that the company did not provide any major announcements at its annual meeting. The company has been in focus lately with the resurfacing of "meme" stock figure Keith Gill, who has touted the company.

  Markets will be closed on Wednesday to mark the Juneteenth National Independence Day. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757860_1_20240618025544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed in India on Monday when a goods train driver missed a signal and slammed into an express passenger train from behind, police and railway officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three passenger carriages were derailed and flipped on their side, while one carriage was thrust high into the air, precariously balanced on another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident in West Bengal state is the latest to hit India's creaking rail network, which carries millions of passengers each day – and the most recent reported failure of drivers missing basic signals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 people were injured and taken to hospital, Jaya Varma Sinha, chairman of India's Railway Board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A goods train disregarded the signal and hit the train from behind," Sinha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included the driver and co-driver, who missed the signal, as well as a train guard and five passengers, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinha said the casualties could have been worse, but a guard wagon and two others carrying post that were attached to the back of the passenger train took the brunt of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were two parcel carriages attached... which protected other carriages from extensive damage," she said, but added that the guard wagon "was badly damaged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash took place in the Phansidewa area of Darjeeling district, when the Kanchenjunga Express train was hit by the goods train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to "those who lost their loved ones," in a post on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called the crash "tragic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments after the collision, she said that "ambulances and disaster teams" were rushed to the site, giving orders for "action on a war footing" to be initiated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local police officer Iftikar-Ul-Hassan said he saw several badly injured people pulled out of the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The toll could rise further, as four people are admitted in a serious condition," he said, adding that rescue teams were working to return the line to service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tracks are being cleared and restored for operations," he added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's sports minister, Amelie Oudea-Castera, on Monday hailed as exemplary a statement by football superstar Kylian Mbappe urging voters not to back extremes in snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron to combat the far right.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mbappe, representing France at the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, said he was "against extremes and divisive ideas" and urged young people to vote at a "crucial moment" in French history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments from Mbappe, 25, one of the icons of modern France, have sparked a stream of controversy, with figures on the right warning him against interfering in politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kylian spoke in an absolutely exemplary manner yesterday (Sunday). He wanted to speak to young people at a totally unprecedented and decisive moment for the future," of the country, said Oudea-Castera.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's men's football team has long been seen as a beacon for diversity in the country. The French Football Federation has urged against "any form of pressure and political use of the French team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I will still be proud to wear this shirt after July 7," said Mbappe, referring to the second round of the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The striker defended comments made on Saturday by his teammate Marcus Thuram, saying he "had not gone too far" in calling on the country "to fight every day to stop" the RN winning the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we can all see that extremists are very close to winning power and we have the opportunity to choose the future of our country," Mbappe said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, several dozen French sports personalities including tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and athlete Marie-Jose Perec also called for a vote against the far right, in an op-ed for L'Equipe sports daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see that our athletes want to make their voices heard," added Oudea-Castera, herself a former professional tennis player, as she attended rehearsals for the Olympics opening ceremony on the River Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an attitude that is courageous, committed, and that can be applauded, that is deeply respectable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former French football star Thierry Henry, now coach of the French Olympic team, also added his voice, urging voters to "block the extremes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there is something that is still important, what can block the extremes is to go and vote. So go and vote," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally, I am against anything that divides and a little more for anything that can unite," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) may win the largest number of votes in the election but may struggle to form an overall majority. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The star of French rugby and pin-up for this summer's Paris Olympics Antoine Dupont has called for an end to the "macho" cliches linked to the game and "stop homophobia in our sport."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old, who was World Rugby men's 15s Player of the Year in 2021, made the comment in an interview in the next edition of the French LGBTQ magazine Tetu, to be published on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one professional rugby player in France, Jeremy Clamy-Edroux who plays for third division Rouen, has publicly declared his homosexuality but Dupont said there were certainly more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I very much doubt that there is only one gay on the pitch!" the Toulouse and France scrum-half said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal is for all players to feel good about their sexuality and to be accepted by others."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if rugby can be seen as macho, we are very open-minded, and today I think we are all capable of accepting each other's sexual orientations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really need to repeat it, communicate about it, so that everyone definitely feels comfortable with it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupont captained France in last year's World Cup and is poised to line up for the sevens team at this summer's Games. (AFP)

    Prague extradites Indian murder plot suspect to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The intended vicitm of the alleged murder plot is a Sikh separatist who supports the Khalistan movement. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757851_1_20240617234247.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech police said on Monday that an Indian citizen suspected of involvement in an alleged plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States had been extradited there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Justice Department charged the man, identified as Nikhil Gupta, in November with plotting to assassinate a Sikh separatist leader on US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged an Indian government official was also involved in planning the plot to kill the person, a US citizen of Indian origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Sikhs support the Khalistan movement, that wants an independent homeland in the northern Indian province of Punjab, which Indian authorities strongly oppose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has cracked down on the movement while denying involvement in the targeting of pro-Khalistan activists outside India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The foreigner suspected in the United States of an assassination plot has been in the hands of the US judiciary since Friday," Czech police said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that Gupta was "safely extradited from a Prague airport," posting video images of the man being escorted into a plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gupta was detained at Prague airport on June 30, 2023, under extradition orders issued by the US Justice Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said the man allegedly targeted in the killing "is a vocal critic of the Indian government and leads a US-based organisation that advocates for the secession of Punjab."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was elected to a third term this month, had vowed to "look into" the case while visiting the United States in late 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's foreign ministry has said it created a "high-level" inquiry committee to investigate the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, The Washington Post reported in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A similar case in Canada has meanwhile sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada arrested and charged four Indian nationals in May over their alleged role in the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a separatist Sikh leader, in Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, had advocated for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wanted by Indian authorities for alleged "terrorism" and conspiracy to commit murder – allegations he denied – Nijjar was shot and killed on June 18, 2023, outside the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had "credible allegations" connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India dismissed the allegations as "absurd" and responded by briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Monday said it will appoint managers to the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School, which is set to close in two years, citing ineffective management at the institution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sponsoring body of the Wong Tai Sin school – the Confucian Academy – announced over the weekend that the school would cease operations from the 2026-27 academic year and stop accepting primary one pupils from 2025-26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press conference on Monday, the school's principal Yuen Poon Suk-han said she and the management committee were not consulted on the academy's decision to suspend the school beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the academy said the school's chancellor had informed its managers and principal in April, and that the decision was "carefully considered".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, the bureau said it had met with the school's principal and sponsoring body multiple times and that the two parties had failed to reach a consensus on a transition plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it will appoint managers to the school to ensure that it is managed properly and that the closure aligns with existing mechanisms and procedures.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to North Korea on Tuesday for a "friendly" visit, the Kremlin announced, as the West suspects Pyongyang of supplying Moscow with weapons for its Ukraine offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit to the world's most reclusive state comes as Putin seeks ammunition to continue his military campaign launched in February 2022, which has thrown Moscow into unprecedented global isolation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also comes nine months after Putin hosted North Korea's Kim Jong Un on a rare foreign trip to the Russian Far East, where the pair lavished each other with praise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Vladimir Putin on June 18-19 will go to the North Korean Democratic Republic on a friendly state visit," the Kremlin said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said Putin will then travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's few key allies such as China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang rarely hosts foreign guests, isolated diplomatically and having shut itself off even more since the Covid pandemic. (AFP)

    Govt announces strategy on hydrogen development

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced its strategy on hydrogen development, saying it is to address climate change and help achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony, officials said 14 trial projects are in the pipeline, such as using hydrogen to power street-cleaning vehicles and to generate electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the strategy is an important milestone that will help build a carbon-free city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we are pursuing carbon neutrality, it is necessary for us to acquire what we call the zero-carbon energy in order to support the green transition. Hydrogen is one of the zero-carbon energies,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe that hydrogen has a great potential to develop a new green economy in Hong Kong, because its production, its storage and also its application in different sectors will enhance the employment of labour and the setting up of new industry,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that changes to the law will be proposed in the first half of next year to ensure safe storage and supply of the highly combustible gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR already has a hydrogen double-decker bus and the MTR will trial a hydrogen-powered light rail vehicle later this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday hit back at a G7 end-of-summit statement that took aim at China, accusing it of being "full of arrogance, prejudice and lies".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The G7 summit statement once again manipulated China-related issues, slandered and attacked China, rehashed cliches that have no factual basis, no legal basis, and no moral justification, and are full of arrogance, prejudice and lies," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Group of Seven leaders met last week in Italy, souring trade relations with Beijing as well as tensions over Ukraine and the South China Sea were a focus of their discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement released at the end of the summit said China was sending dual-use materials to Russia which were helping Moscow's war in Ukraine. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his country's six-member war cabinet, in a widely expected move that came after the departure from government of the centrist former general Benny Gantz.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was now expected to hold consultations about the Gaza war with a small group of ministers, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer who had been in the war cabinet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister had faced demands from the nationalist-religious partners in his coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to be included in the war cabinet, a move which would have intensified strains with international partners including the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forum was formed after Gantz joined Netanyahu in a national unity government at the start of the Gaza war in October and also included Gantz's partner Gadi Eisenkot and Aryeh Deri, head of the religious party Shas, as observers. (Reuters)

    Flights resume as airport runway reopens

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Monday afternoon said that the north runway at Chek Lap Kok was up and running again after a cargo plane, that had burst a tyre, was towed away at around 3 pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jet made an emergency landing at around 7:30 am, forcing the closure of the runway for almost eight hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one runway remained in operation, and around 450 flights were delayed as a result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers said their itineraries were badly affected, with some complaining that they had missed their onward connections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said even though both runways had since resumed operation, some flights could still be disrupted as a backlog was being cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged passengers to keep tabs on the latest flight information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Monday evening the Airport Authority said the Airport Express Link would run more frequently after midnight, with the last train to Hong Kong Station departing at 1:30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said the airport's Automated People Mover System and customer service counters would stay open until 3 am.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Monday said tourists made nearly 3.4 million trips to Hong Kong in May, a 20 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said initial figures show that some 2.6 million trips were made by mainlanders, which was a 15 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trips by travellers from outside the mainland jumped by some 43 percent, to more than 771,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cumulatively, a total of 18 million visitors arrived in Hong Kong from January to May this year, increasing by 80 percent from the same period last year," the board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The border between Hong Kong and the mainland fully reopened in early February last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the DAB said Hong Kong can consider making use of its culture of martial arts novels and TV series to attract tourists, together with fellow Greater Bay Area cities like Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party vice-chairman Holden Chow told reporters the SAR can think about hosting activities around "intangible assets", like novels written by the late Jin Yong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they are still very attractive to many people around the world, including those from South East Asia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday said it had launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork and pork by-products from the European Union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce has opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of relevant pork and pig by-products originating from the European Union," the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation would begin on June 17, the ministry said, and was prompted by a complaint submitted by the China Animal Husbandry Association on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry said the investigation should be completed by June 17, 2025, but could be extended by another six months if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the European Commission's June 12 announcement that it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from July, global food companies have been on high alert for retaliatory tariffs from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities on the mainland had previously dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. (Agencies)

    No civil servant tests on security laws: govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ingrid Yeung told lawmakers there will be national security training, but not examinations, for new and existing government workers." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757780_1_20240617140633.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said there are no plans to test government workers on how familiar they are with national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of tests was brought up by lawmakers at a Legco panel meeting to discuss the updated Civil Service Code, which sets resolutely safeguarding national security as a core value of government staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said there will be plenty of national security training for new and existing government workers, but not examinations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Training is about integrity and attitude. You can't really test that in an examination," she told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, you can ask them to quote many examples, but can they actually deliver? That's more important. That's why we will assess their day-to-day performance and their conduct as we appraise colleagues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The updated code also states that in their official capacity, civil servants cannot criticise any government policies or support opposing views, and they must be loyal to the chief executive of the day and the Central People's Government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Siu-chung, from the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, asked for clarity on this, saying it's hard to know when someone is speaking whether it's in their official or personal capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He argued that if government workers are not allowed to make public criticism in a personal capacity, it may not be good for overall governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said this is something for civil servants to work out for themselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that if a policy is in the consultation stage, government workers can speak more freely, but once a decision is made they should be extra careful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same meeting, lawmakers also discussed a planned across-the-board three percent pay rise for civil servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung dismissed a claim from the federation's Lam Chun-sing that the government has been under pressure from employers to keep rises in check, so that private sector staff don't demand bigger increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister reiterated that the latest pay decision was made based on several factors, including the government's budget deficit.

    Consumer watchdog warns of hidden fees at pet hotels

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pet owners should study the fine print carefully when choosing a lodging for their furry friends and avoid those which are unlicensed, according to the Consumer Council.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council randomly selected 18 licensed pet hotels across Hong Kong for study earlier this year. Only five had their fee structures published online, meaning consumers had to make enquiries, a process which could be tedious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different operators also had varying charging schemes. Some charged up to double the normal rate during peak periods such as the Lunar New Year holiday, while the administering of medicines or nutritional supplements all came at a cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the event of injury, illness or even death, only four hotels would provide compensation of between HK$300 and HK$5,000. Eight others stated they would assume no legal liability through disclaimers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart form urging pet hotel operators to be more transparent in their fee structures, the watchdog also hoped the government could amend the rules so that all licensed animal boarding providers were published on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, the council conducted a survey of private camping sites in Hong Kong and found that nearly 40 percent of them were suspected of operating illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only three of the 22 venues covered in the study carried a proper licence or compliance certificate to operate a holiday camp. Authorities were verifying if any operator had breached rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council also studied another seven "glamping" sites which provide extra amenities. Only three were covered by third-party liability insurance, meaning people staying at other sites may not have adequate protection in case of emergencies or accidents.

    Government plans to raise university tuition fees

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Government plans to raise university tuition fees" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757765_1_20240617124143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Monday said the government plans to raise university tuition fees in the next few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local undergraduate students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions pay an annual tuition fee of HK$42,100 – an amount that has remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Choi said a fee increase for such students will be implemented in stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After all these years... there's been 40 percent inflation, but we haven't raised tuition fees at all. So we think it's time for a review and to maintain fiscal discipline," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the government will make an announcement in advance so that universities can introduce more grants and bursaries for students in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the minister said she expects more institutions to offer applied degree programmes that combine theory and practical skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his policy address last year to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education and to facilitate the establishment of universities of applied sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that each university has its own strengths, so there should be a division of labour regarding the courses they offer in the future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of rush-hour commuters had to be evacuated from an MTR train on Monday morning, after a 40-centimetre snake was seen slithering through one of the carriages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they were notified at around 7:30am that a black and white snake was spotted on a Tsuen Wan Line train that was approaching Admiralty station from Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All passengers were asked to disembark at Admiralty, and no one was injured in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A snake catcher was called in soon after, and the serpent – believed to be a nonvenomous California Kingsnake – was captured and sent to Kadoorie Farm.

    Better labelling for air purifiers needed: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called on manufacturers of air purifiers to clearly indicate how much clean air their products can deliver per minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said clearly stating the clean air delivery rate would help buyers make better choices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council tested 10 air purifiers, and found big differences in their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best performing model was 12.3 times better than the worst at removing formaldehyde, while variations in their effectiveness in removing smoke ranged up to 2.7 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said the clean air delivery rate could act as a convenient metric for consumers to compare different air purifier models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because the standards of filtration is quite different among different countries, no matter it is dust or pollens or cigarette smoke, it's quite diverse,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is easier for consumers to compare based on the CADR - the clean air delivery rate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health reminded consumers to clean their purifiers regularly to minimise the risk of diseases, while the Hong Kong Medical Association reminded people to maintain air circulation by keeping windows open to ensure indoor air quality.

    China-Australia ties on the right track: Li Qiang

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's relationship with Australia is on the right track, Premier Li Qiang said in Canberra on Monday as the two trading partners moved on from their economic dispute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Australia since 2017, Li held high-level talks with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese following a welcome ceremony at Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In less than one year Prime Minister Albanese and I have met multiple times and exchanged visits to each other's country," Li said following their meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This shows that our countries attach great importance to our relationship and that this relationship is on the right track of steady improvement and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said he and Albanese had a "candid exchange of views on some differences and disagreements", and the two countries have agreed to properly manage those differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier added the further development of bilateral ties requires joint efforts from both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his opening remarks, Albanese said China and Australia had complementary economies and shared interests in addressing climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have our differences... that's why candid dialogue is so important. For Australia, we consistently advocate the importance of a region and world that is peaceful, stable and prosperous, where countries respect sovereignty and abide by international laws," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia advocates that we should all work together to promote a regional balance where no country dominates and no country is dominated.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting in 2020, a slew of Australia's most lucrative export commodities were effectively banned from China as diplomatic relations rapidly unravelled. But as ties have gradually improved under a new government in Canberra, Beijing has wound back most of these trade barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains overwhelmingly Australia's largest trading partner. Australian farmers, miners and exporters are already seeing the benefits of the removal of trade impediments – benefits that flow to our economy," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also described the discussions with Li as constructive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier Li also said the two countries would expand cooperation in energy and mining, and China would include Australia in its visa waiver programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the two sides will take steps to improve military communication to avoid incidents. "One of the very practical measures that we spoke about was improving military-to-military communication so as to avoid incidents," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an incident last month, a Chinese air force jet dropped flares near an Australian defence helicopter in international airspace over the Yellow Sea. Canberra called it a dangerous encounter whereas the Foreign Ministry in Beijing accused the Australian military of provocative and threatening behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li visited New Zealand before Australia and is scheduled to stop in Malaysia on Tuesday before returning to China. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said on Monday morning there could be disruptions to flights in and out of Hong Kong for a few hours due to the closure of the north runway.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The closure followed an emergency landing by a cargo plane at around 7:30am, during which the jet experienced a flat tyre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said only one runway remained in operation for the time being, and flights schedules may be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on passengers to watch out for the latest flight information.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows improving consumer sentiment, although industrial output lagged expectations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757755_1_20240617113531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales figures in May, a major indicator of consumption sentiment, rose 3.7 percent year on year to 3.92 trillion yuan, accelerating from a 2.3 percent increase in April and marking the quickest rate of growth since February.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newly released data on Monday from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also showed that retail sales climbed 4.1 percent year on year in the first five months of 2024, to hit 19.52 trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected retail sales to grow three percent due to the five-day public holiday earlier in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, industrial output on the mainland lagged expectations with the property sector still weak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial data released by the NBS came in below expectations for a six percent increase, with output rising only 5.6 percent year on year in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded four percent in the first five months of 2024 from the same period a year earlier, versus expectations for a 4.2 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It grew 4.2 percent in the January to April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS also reported that China's raw coal output fell three percent year on year to 1.86 billion tonnes in the first five months of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May alone, the country's raw coal output stood at 380 million tonnes, down 0.8 percent year on year, although the decline was 2.1 percentage points narrower than in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's property market downturn, high local government debt and deflation remained heavy drags on economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures point to an uneven growth pattern that reinforced calls for more fiscal and monetary policy support from the central government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With narrowing interest margins and a weakening currency remaining key constraints limiting Beijing's scope to ease monetary policy, China's central bank left a key policy rate unchanged as expected on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's second-largest economy grew faster than expected at 5.3 percent in the first quarter, but analysts said the government's around five percent annual growth target was ambitious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's exports grew faster than expected in May helped by improved global demand, but growth in imports slowed significantly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tepid demand at home has also kept a lid on consumer prices as confidence remains low in the face of a protracted property sector crisis while new bank lending rebounded less than expected in May. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight people have died of suffocation in a refrigerated truck in Henan province, a local investigation team said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They were found unconscious when the vehicle arrived at a petrol station on Saturday evening in Hongzhuangyang Township in Yexian County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victims were confirmed dead in the small hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the eight had stayed in the insulated compartment of the vehicle, which was against regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear if they were Chinese nationals or foreigners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The truck driver and other "responsible personnel" have been detained, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the case was being investigated. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly minted world record-holder Gretchen Walsh punched her ticket to the Paris Olympics on Sunday with a victory in the women's 100 metres butterfly in a swift time of 55.31 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old American couldn't match the astonishing 55.18 she threw down in the semi-finals of the US Olympic swimming trials to shatter Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem's previous mark of 55.48 -- but she clocked the second-fastest time ever and secured a berth at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still in shock," Walsh said. "I don't even know what to say. Making the team was the biggest goal, but getting a world record was absolutely insanity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh's mark in the butterfly on Saturday was the third world record set in women's swimming over the past couple of months, coming on the back of Canadian Summer McIntosh's effort in the 400 metres individual medley and Australian star Ariarne Titmus' blistering time in the 200 metres freestyle.

    Vu wins LPGA Meijer Classic after playoff thriller

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lilia Vu holds the Meijer LPGA Classic trophy. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757722_1_20240617083239.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lilia Vu staged a sensational final round charge before snatching victory in a playoff to win the LPGA Meijer Classic in Michigan on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vu fired a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 at Blythefield Country Club in suburban Grand Rapids to finish with a 72-hole 16-under-par aggregate of 272.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was good enough to send the two-time major champion into a sudden-death playoff with Lexi Thompson and Australia's Grace Kim, who wilted over the final 18 holes after leading by five shots after Saturday's third round. Kim advanced to the playoff after a closing one-over 73.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three women all grabbed birdies on the first playoff hole, the par-five 18th, and then repeated the trio of birdies after replaying 18 for the second playoff hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On both occasions Kim had difficult eagle putts to snatch victory but was unable to convert either. The third playoff hole headed to the par-five fourth, and it was Vu who kept her nerve as the tension mounted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old from California looked to be in trouble after sending her second shot into a greenside bunker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a brilliant sand wedge left her with a short birdie putt, and after Thompson and Kim missed their birdie chances, she duly rolled in the six-footer to clinch the fifth LPGA title of her career. (AFP)

    DeChambeau edges McIlroy by one stroke to win US Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bryson DeChambeau celebrates with the US Open trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757721_1_20240617082133.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau captured his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy by one stroke in a dramatic back-nine duel at Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old American, who also won the 2020 US Open, fired a one-over-par 71 to finish on six-under-par 274 while McIlroy shot 69 to stand on 275 after 72 holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, thwarted in a bid to end a 10-year major win drought, led by two strokes with five holes to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland made bogeys on three of the last four holes to help hand the trophy to DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a collapse mindful of Greg Norman's epic 1996 last-round loss to Nick Faldo at Pinehurst, McIlroy missed par putts from 2.5 feet at the par-3 17th and just inside four feet at the par-4 18th -- tension-packed misses for bogeys that left McIlroy one behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau found dirt and weeds left and a bunker at 18 but blasted his third shot to four feet and sank his pressure-packed putt for the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raising his arms in triumph, DeChambeau screamed and jumped for joy, then paid tribute to the late Payne Stewart, the 1999 US Open winner at Pinehurst who died only a few months later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's Payne right there, baby," DeChambeau said into a television camera, pointing to a pin of Stewart on his cap. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's Jude Bellingham celebrates scoring their first goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757720_1_20240617081811.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England got their quest for a first major tournament title in 58 years off to a winning start as Jude Bellingham's header was enough to beat Serbia 1-0, while the Netherlands grabbed a late 2-1 win over Poland on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Christian Eriksen enjoyed a fairytale return to the European Championship, three years after suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch, by scoring the opening goal, but Denmark were held 1-1 by Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England had been hyped as one of the favourites for the tournament as Gareth Southgate aims to finally steer a richly-talented generation to glory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they left plenty of room for improvement in a flat tournament debut in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham was the exception as the Real Madrid midfielder confirmed his status as one of the world's rising stars with a man-of-the-match display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first half showed why we can score goals against any team and the second half showed why we can keep clean sheets against any team," said Bellingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old became the first European player to grace three major tournaments before turning 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he capped a brilliant individual display with the only goal when he headed in Bukayo Saka's deflected cross on 13 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were forced to see out a nervy finale as Jordan Pickford turned over Dusan Vlahovic's dipping drive before Harry Kane headed away Veljko Birmancevic's goalbound shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the Netherlands, Wout Weghorst struck in the 83rd minute, just two minutes after coming on as a substitute, to secure an opening Group D victory against Poland, who were without the injured Robert Lewandowski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the Poland supporters whose voices echoed around the Volksparkstadion when Adam Buksa headed their team in front early on, but Cody Gakpo levelled an entertaining encounter before the half-hour mark with the aid of a deflection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo, Memphis Depay and Denzel Dumfries all went close as the missed chances piled up for the Oranje, and Ronald Koeman's men looked to be running out of ideas until Weghorst swooped to slot home a deserved winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksen collapsed during Denmark's opening game at the delayed Euro 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exactly 1,100 days on, the Manchester United midfielder put the Danes in front with a sweet strike in Stuttgart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do think this time my story at the Euros is very different from the last one," said Eriksen. (AFP)

    S Africa's Zuma vows to fight 'rigged' elections

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South African former president Jacob Zuma said on Sunday his new party would join an opposition alliance to coordinate resistance to the government, while maintaining its challenge to the general election results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The 2024 elections were rigged" the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela said, reading out a statement on behalf of the 82-year-old ex-leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have instructed our legal team to take any steps possible both inside of South Africa and internationally to ensure that justice is done."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he added: "At the right time we will call on our people to demonstrate their dissatisfaction against all these injustices peacefully, in the streets, in the court and even in parliament until our grievances are addressed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK also said it would join a newly formed parliamentary grouping that includes several mostly leftist opposition parties represented in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Called the "Progressive Caucus" it is currently led by the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which won 39 seats in the new parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma, a stern expression on his face, sat quietly as his speech was read out, occasionally answering questions from the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK came third in the election, winning 14.6 percent of the vote and 58 parliamentary seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the party boycotted the country's first parliamentary sitting where Zuma's long-term political foe Cyril Ramaphosa was re-elected as president for a second term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party announced it had launched a fresh court bid to dispute the "rigged" election results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had already gone to court to try to prevent the new parliament from convening, and lodged a separate complaint over alleged election irregularities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other parties have also complained to the country's electoral body and lodged legal complaints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa, who will be inaugurated on June 19, will lead what he calls a government of national unity after the May poll produced no outright winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national unity government includes the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and other smaller groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal got a frosty reception from the opposition parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndhlela for the MK denounced the new coalition as a "white-led unholy alliance" that "must be crushed before it finds its feet." He accused the ANC of going to "bed with the racists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EFF dismissed the idea of working with rivals holding radically different political views, such as the DA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma has been a bitter rival of Ramaphosa's ever since he was ousted by his own party, the African National Congress (ANC), under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018 and replaced by Rampaphosa. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer who tried to intercept a fleeing cow by hitting it with a vehicle in England has been removed from duty, police said in a statement on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The incident occurred on Friday evening after police were called to a sighting of a cow in a residential area of the small town of Staines-upon-Thames in southern England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surrey Police on Sunday said that the officer driving the car had been "removed from frontline duties pending the outcome of these investigations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp of Surrey Police said: "I fully appreciate the distress our handling of this incident has caused and will ensure that it is thoroughly and diligently investigated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published on social media and in the British press showed a police car hitting the animal twice. The cow ended up with its head and upper body trapped under the police car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can think of no reasonable need for this action. I've asked for a full, urgent explanation for this. It appears to be unnecessarily heavy handed," Home Secretary James Cleverly wrote on X, formally Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, police said that after several unsuccessful attempts to recover the cow and taking public safety into account, a decision was made to intercept the cow using the police vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10-month-old cow, christened "Beau Lucy," was examined by a vet and reunited with its owner who said the animal was "doing better." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German police shot and injured a man after he threatened passers-by and officers with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail ahead of a Euro 2024 match in Hamburg on Sunday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At around midday on Sunday (1000 GMT), a man threatened several passers-by and police officers with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail," police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police then shot and injured the attacker, who "may have been having a psychiatric crisis," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamburg was thronging with football fans at the time ahead of the Euro 2024 match between Poland and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, police said there was no indication of a link to the Euro 2024 clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man came out of a snack bar holding the weapons and approached passers-by and police at the scene "in a threatening manner," the police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he did not comply with a request to put them down, police shot at him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesman said he was shot in the leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was treated by first-aiders at the scene and then taken to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect has been identified as a 39-year-old German man, the police said, adding that his motive was not known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said earlier on X, formerly Twitter, that the incident had triggered a "major operation" in the city's St Pauli district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It happened near the Reeperbahn station, more than a kilometre away from the city's official football fan zone. (AFP)

    Israel announces daily Gaza 'pause' for aid deliveries

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gazans hold Eid al-Adha prayers by the ruins of the Al-Rahma mosque. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757699_1_20240617002227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military said on Sunday it would "pause" fighting around a south Gaza route daily to facilitate aid deliveries, following months of warnings of famine in the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement of a "local, tactical pause of military activity" during daylight hours in an area of Rafah came a day after eight Israeli soldiers were killed in a blast near the far-southern city and three more troops died elsewhere, in one of the heaviest losses for the army in its war against Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations welcomed the Israeli move, although "this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need," said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, calling for "further concrete measures" on aid needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Gazans "urgently need food, water, sanitation, shelter, and healthcare, with many living near piles of solid waste, heightening health risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be able to deliver aid safely throughout Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN agencies and aid groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm of dire shortages of food and other essentials in the Gaza Strip, exacerbated by overland access restrictions and the closure of the key Rafah crossing with Egypt since Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has long defended its efforts to let aid into Gaza including via its Kerem Shalom border near Rafah, blaming militants for looting supplies and humanitarian workers for failing to distribute them to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes will take place from 8.00am (0500 GMT) until 7.00pm (1600 GMT) every day until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Salah al-Din road and then northwards," a military statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A map released by the army showed the declared humanitarian route extending until Rafah's European Hospital, about 10 kilometres from Kerem Shalom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came as Muslims worldwide mark Eid al-Adha, but there is little to celebrate in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no joy. We have been robbed of it," said Malakiya Salman, a 57-year-old displaced woman, now living in a tent in Khan Younis city in the southern Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gazans, like Muslims the world over, would usually slaughter sheep for the holiday – whose Arabic name means "feast of the sacrifice" – and share the meat with the needy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents would also gift children new clothes and money in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses in Gaza's north and centre reported no fighting on Sunday morning, though there was some shelling and at least one strike in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military stressed in a statement there was "no cessation of hostilities in the southern Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the pause was already in effect and part of efforts to "increase the volumes of humanitarian aid" following discussions with the UN and other organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, which has been pressing close ally Israel as well as Hamas to accept a ceasefire plan laid out by President Joe Biden, on Friday imposed sanctions on an extremist Israeli group for blocking and attacking Gaza-bound aid convoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the eight soldiers killed on Saturday were hit by an explosion as they were travelling in an armoured vehicle near Rafah, where troops were engaged in fierce street battles against Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the blast was "apparently from an explosive device planted in the area or from the firing of an anti-tank missile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, two soldiers were killed in fighting in northern Gaza and another succumbed to wounds inflicted in recent fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses brought the Israeli military's overall toll to 309 deaths since it began its its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his condolences following "this terrible loss" and said that "despite the heavy and unsettling price, we must cling to the goals of the war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas following the Palestinian group's unprecedented October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,337 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. (AFP)

    Ukraine peace summit says dialogue needed to end war

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Representatives from more than 90 countries had gathered for the two-day peace summit. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757698_1_20240616235730.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of countries said on Sunday that Ukraine's "territorial integrity" should be respected in any peace deal to end the war, as they said "dialogue between all parties" would be necessary for a lasting settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a final communique issued at the end of a major two-day diplomatic summit in Switzerland, the vast majority of countries also backed a call for the full exchange of captured soldiers and return of deported Ukrainian children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not all attendees backed the document, with India, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates among those not included in a list of supporting states displayed on screens at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that reaching peace requires the involvement of and dialogue between all parties," the document stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "We reaffirm our commitment to ... the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognised borders."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 countries had gathered in the Swiss resort of Burgenstock for the summit, dedicated to discussing Kyiv's proposals for a route out of the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow was not invited and has rejected the summit as "absurd" and pointless.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv had worked hard to secure attendance from countries that maintain warm relations with Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final document also called for all prisoners of war to be released in a "complete exchange" and for all Ukrainian children who had been "deported and unlawfully displaced" to be returned to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv accuses Russia of abducting almost 20,000 children from parts of the east and south of the country that its forces took control of.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Working groups at the summit also addressed the issues of global food security and nuclear safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Food security must not be weaponised in any way," the declaration stated, adding that access to ports in the Black and Azov Seas was "critical" for global food supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the countries also called for Ukraine to have "full sovereign control" over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located in the south of Ukraine, the facility is Europe's largest nuclear energy site and has been controlled by Russian forces since early in the war. (AFP)

    At least 19 hajj pilgrims dead in Saudi Arabia

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 Jordanian and Iranian pilgrims have died while on the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, authorities from their countries said on Sunday, as temperatures soar in the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "14 Jordanian pilgrims died and 17 others were missing" during the performance of hajj rituals, Jordan's foreign ministry said in a statement, not specifying their cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand said "five Iranian pilgrims have lost their lives so far in Mecca and Medina during the hajj this year," also not saying how they died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hajj, one of the world's biggest religious gatherings, is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must perform it at least once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures have pushed well past 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) during the annual pilgrimage that around 1.8 million Muslims are taking part in this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the rituals are performed outdoors and on foot, creating challenges especially among the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not provided any information on fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the kingdom has implemented heat mitigation measures, including climate-controlled areas, distributes water, and offers advice to pilgrims on protecting themselves from the sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During last year's hajj at least 240 people – many from Indonesia – died, according to figures announced by various countries which also did not specify causes of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10,000 heat-related illnesses were recorded last year, 10 percent of them heat stroke, a Saudi official said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Saudi study said regional temperatures were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade, and worsening heat may be outpacing mitigation measures. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of erectile dysfunction pills, anti-depressants and other psychotropic drugs have been seized in Hong Kong this month with four people arrested on suspicion of running a medication mail service without a permit, customs officers said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 1.4 million pills, found in a remote village house in Mui Wo and at a subdivided factory unit in San Po Kong, are believed to be worth around HK$80 million in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the hauls mostly comprised of generic drugs from India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's believed the pills were being posted to dozens of places around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior customs investigator, Hong Yan, said they were looking into whether the two cases are linked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that the two syndicates operate in a very similar fashion. They both rented a unit as a centre for packaging and storing the medicines," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They also hired foreigners to package and post the medicines overseas. Furthermore, inside the units, the ways the drugs were categorised and stored were very similar."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said two women arrested in Mui Wo at the start of the month had since been released on bail, while two women arrested in San Po Kong were still in detention.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifteen men and five women have been arrested on suspicion of loan sharking and illegal debt collection, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said that during an operation, officers seized HK$300,000 in cash, bank cards, phones, computers and debt collection notes, as well as cars and watches suspected to be the proceeds of crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said more than a million dollars was loaned to nine people in Sau Mau Ping in recent months, and a group threatened and harassed those who failed to repay the money on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our intelligence indicated that the syndicate used various illegal debt collecting methods, including splashing red paint to debtors’ flats, damaging the door locks and criminal intimidation to force the debtors to repay their loans,” said Inspector Leung Ho-ching.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police added that they have identified a bank account linked to the case that was allegedly used to launder at least HK$5.8 million.

    Tenants cautiously back idea of subdivided flat purge

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said a survey it has carried out suggests the majority of people living in poor housing support the government's goal of ridding the city of low-quality subdivided units, but they're also concerned about where they would move to if it happens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Caritas Community Development Service said it spoke to 231 tenants of subdivided flats and cubic apartments from December to April, and found that 70 percent think the government should regulate low-quality subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 60 percent said they worry they wouldn't be able to find an affordable home if such a move was taken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They think that if the government takes the action to regulate subdivided housing, it means that there would be fewer subdivided flats in the urban areas. So they may need to afford a higher rent, and they may not find suitable units," said Kelvin Lee, a social worker with the NGO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government's Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units has been asked to come up with proposals on minimum living standards for such homes, as well as how those that are substandard can be eradicated altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, officials announced that applications for Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing will open from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee said single non-elderly people are less likely to secure a place under a points system that prioritises families living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The social worker added that building more public housing is the long-term solution to the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to consider using the vacant land reserve to build more public housing, especially in the urban areas, since most of the low-income talents are living in those urban areas, which is near their jobs and schools for the children," Lee said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfer Hayley Chan has won a bronze medal in the wing foil European Championships in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She defeated French windsurfer Anais Mai Desjardins by 11 points in the final to come third, with two Italian athletes above Chan on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan, 33, beat fellow SAR athlete Ngai Wai-yan in the previous round. Ngai finished fifth in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Windsurfing Association of Hong Kong, China said this was Chan's first go at the European Championships, having twice been an Asian champion. She's also a two-time Olympian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association said two others it sponsored in the race, Rafeek Kikabhoy and Chow Tsz-hei, finished 13th and 18th respectively in the men's race. Another Hongkonger, Era Lin, meanwhile, came 26th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes will return to the SAR after the competition to prepare for the wing foil world cup in August, the association said.

    'Kowloon City vendors want to return after revamp'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some food vendors in Kowloon City say they want to move back to the neighbourhood after a revamp. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757649_1_20240616122050.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Sunday said more than half of shop operators it spoke to in Kowloon City want to move back to the neighbourhood after a makeover designed to beautify the area and preserve its culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing project, covering three sections of Carpenter Road and Nga Tsin Wai Road, will see the Kowloon City wet market relocated and some of its surrounding areas demolished to make way for more than 4,000 new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, wrote on his blog that the URA held 15 meetings with wet market food vendors and Thai restaurant operators to brief them on relocation and transitional arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They shared with the team that they have been doing business in the 'Dragon City' district for many years and are attached to the district, hoping to pass on the friendship," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some operators also hope to pass on the regional characteristics to the next generation through the relocation arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said the authority will reserve some shops for these vendors after the area is rebuilt and offer concessionary rent for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA earlier said it hopes the new Kowloon City Market can be completed by 2030 while most of the other proposed facilities can be ready by 2037.

    Officials greet first overnight high-speed trains

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first overnight high-speed trains from Beijing and Shanghai to Hong Kong arrived on Sunday morning, with tourism minister Kevin Yeung saying passengers were generally positive about the “sleep and arrive” arrangement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung and MTR CEO Jacob Kam welcomed passengers at Hong Kong West Kowloon Station and handed out souvenirs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourism chief said passengers told him they thought it was good to be able to sleep on the train and arrive refreshed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe it provides an extra option. In the past, most travellers from Shanghai and Beijing would choose to take a plane. Even if they took high-speed trains, that would be during daytime,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now that the option of taking an overnight train is available, passengers can make better use of their time. They can sleep on the train and when they arrive in Hong Kong in the morning they can do the things they want. They have a whole day to travel.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger from Shanghai, who brought his son along to experience a sleeper train for the first time, said he was satisfied with the facilities, but his son had trouble sleeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The noise level is a bit high. Otherwise it's quite good. There's no problem for an individual to fall asleep. During the trip the train passed through some tunnels that generated a big noise," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kam said while demand for the first few trains was really positive, it is still too early to discuss the possibility of increasing the frequency of services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to consider the passenger needs and the needs for various destinations. Also we need to consider that the sleeper trains pass through various railway tracks and they require maintenance. We need to strive a balance between maintenance work and the passenger need,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the first Beijing-bound sleeper train from Hong Kong arrived in the capital on Sunday morning. Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, said he really enjoyed his meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I had grilled beef with king trumpet mushroom rice. The portion of the beef is quite large and there are many varieties of the side dishes. There are vegetables, meat and sauce, and the rice is also warm. Therefore I highly recommend it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he was not worried that the new services will encourage more tourists not to stay in a hotel when they visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four sleeper trains run every Friday to Monday night, with two travelling from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Beijing and two going in the opposite direction.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong officials on Sunday celebrated Father's Day by sharing stories about them and their children, as they wished all dads a good day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee posted a photo online of a card his son made him decades ago when he nominated him for a "top ten modern day father" award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he felt warm and proud to see it again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife had written a message on the card saying "although he is very busy with work, he spends time every week chit-chatting with me. He also encouraged me to take part in more community work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said it was unfortunate he couldn't attend the fathers' award ceremony at the time because of work, and nowadays he also loses time with his family because he is busy in the office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Lee thanked his family for supporting him so he can focus on work and make good policies for the people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he spent the weekend playing football with several fathers and their sons, saying many fathers are often too busy to play with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan wrote on his weekly blog that the government has been putting a lot of resources into sports facilities in recent years, from five-a-side football pitches to the Kai Tak Sports Park, which will be the biggest ever sports infrastructure project in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the park is due to open in the middle of next year and said it should hopefully bring business opportunities as well as spectacular sport and other performances for locals and tourists alike.

    At least nine hurt in Michigan shooting: police

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A shooter has opened fire at a water park in the US state of Michigan, wounding nine or more people including at least one child, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The local sheriff's office said it potentially had the suspect contained near the scene of the shooting in Rochester Hills, a suburb of Detroit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears like the individual pulled up, exited a vehicle, approached the splash pad, opened fire. Reloaded, opened fire. Reloaded. Left. So it appears very random at this point," Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County told reporters, adding he believed the shooter had "no connectivity to the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said preliminary information indicated there were nine to 10 victims of varying ages, including one eight-year-old child. Several hospitals have received patients, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Glock handgun and empty magazines were recovered at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Bouchard, "we believe we have an individual who's a suspect contained nearby."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that assets including SWAT teams and armoured vehicles have been deployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she was "heartbroken" to learn of the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials," she said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun violence in the United States is common, and thousands of Americans are killed each year in shootings. Efforts at broad reforms to the nation's gun laws have been stymied for decades. (AFP)

    DeChambeau moves three shots clear at US Open
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bryson DeChambeau lines up a putt at the seventh hole. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757636_1_20240616093816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau brushed off hip issues to move three shots clear at the top of the US Open third round leaderboard on Saturday, setting up a potential mouth-watering showdown with world number three Rory McIlroy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On another steamy afternoon at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, DeChambeau recovered from an early bogey and troublesome hip that required treatment mid-round to return a three-under 67 to lead Frenchman Matthieu Pavon (69), Patrick Cantlay (70) and McIlroy (69) by three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sitting a further two back and five off the pace are Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (70) and young Swede Ludvig Aberg (73), who had held a one shot lead after the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Trying to stay in the moment, obviously hip wasn't feeling great but luckily I've got a good team and we're going to go figure that out after," said DeChambeau. "I just got two hips that are not fantastic just because of the speed training I do that's the consequences of it but I'll be ready tomorrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had it for a long time now. It's just something that popped up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau will be partnered with Pavon for Sunday's final round but it is McIlroy, paired with Cantlay, who he will share the spotlight with as the former-U.S. Open winners and two of golf's most intriguing figures grapple for the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, bidding to end a decade-long major drought, may be one of golf's most popular figures but the big-hitting DeChambeau has evolved into one of the most entertaining and has enjoyed the backing of huge crowds at Pinehurst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be some golf politics and bragging rights at stake on Sunday with 2020 U.S. Open winner DeChambeau now playing on the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour and McIlroy, long one of the most vocal critics of the renegade circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will mark the 10th time McIlroy has appeared in the top three going into the final round of a major while DeChambeau has played some of the best golf at the biggest events, finishing runner-up at last month's PGA Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking forward to another Sunday in the mix at a major," said McIlroy, who won the last of his four majors at the PGA Championship in 2014. "Awesome opportunity, really excited to be in the position I am in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is what we practice for, this is what we dream of, so really excited for the opportunity, going to go out there tomorrow and give it my all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau broke away from the leading pack with a birdie at the 10th but on his way to the 11th was stretched out on the ground having work done on his hip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any concerns about fitness were quickly dispelled when DeChambeau stepped onto the tee and hammered his longest drive of day at 359-yards before draining a 13-footer for back-to-back birdies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau extended his advantage to four with his third birdie in five holes at the 14th but just when it appeared he might run away from the field was pulled back with a double bogey at the 16th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old responded immediately, rolling in a 12-footer for his sixth birdie triggering wild cheers and chants of "USA, USA".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was amazing," gushed DeChambeau of the fan support. "Man, they riled me up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just gives me a spike in my adrenaline and allows me to focus more on delivering for the fans and for myself and for my family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just inspires me." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning champions England maintained their bid to reach the second round of the T20 World Cup with a 41-run victory in a must-win group game against Namibia in Antigua on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anything other than an England win would have seen Jos Buttler's men knocked out and they were left fearing an early exit when rain delayed the scheduled start by three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, in a match eventually reduced from 11 to 10 overs per side by a fresh downpour, collapsed to 13-2 after losing the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a stand of 56 between the Yorkshire duo of Harry Brook (47 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (31) revived England's innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namibia were left with a target of 126 under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for rain-interrupted matches. But the non-Test nation were never up with the required run-rate and finished on 84-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory took England level on points with Scotland in Group B but with a superior net run-rate – the tie-breaker for teams on equal points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, however, could still be knocked out should Scotland achieve a stunning upset win over already-qualified Australia in the final Group B fixture in St Lucia later on Saturday, or if that game ends in a no-result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Ruben Trumpelmann bowled England captain Buttler, one of the world's best white-ball batsman, for a four-ball duck as he nipped one back sharply off the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran all-rounder David Wiese then produced a magnificent slower ball to have Phil Salt, England's other opener, caught behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain stopped play with England 82-3 off eight overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the match resumed, Brook did the damage in an over from Namibia teenage paceman Jack Brassell, which cost 19 runs, before Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone struck three sixes between them in the last over from Trumpelmann (2-31).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The already-eliminated Namibia retired opener Nikolaas Davin out for 18 to allow the big-hitting Wiese to come in at 44-1 off six overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even with the 39-year-old Wiese – who holed out in the last over of his final international appearance – hitting two sixes and two fours in a 12-ball 27, Namibia finished well-short of their target. (AFP)

    Italy recover to beat Albania, Spain cruise

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nedim Bajrami celebrates scoring the fastest goal ever at a European Championship. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757622_1_20240616064233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy recovered from conceding the fastest goal in the competition's history to get their defence of the European Championship title off to a winning start on Saturday as they came back to beat Albania 2-1 in front of a partisan crowd.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nedim Bajrami stunned the Italians and delighted a huge Albanian support in Dortmund as he smashed in the opener after just 23 seconds, his strike pulverising the previous record for the quickest goal at the Euros of 67 seconds by Dmitri Kirichenko of Russia in 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet Italy's response to falling behind was quick too, as Alessandro Bastoni headed the Azzurri level on 11 minutes and Nicolo Barella's glorious effort put them ahead just past the quarter-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From then on Luciano Spalletti's team looked much more assured, although they really should have won by a greater margin rather than face an anxious finale as Albania pushed for an equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their performance – the first 23 seconds apart – was largely encouraging before an enticing showdown with fellow heavyweights Spain in nearby Gelsenkirchen next Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy are in some ways an unknown quantity coming into this tournament, with the reigning champions having also missed the last two World Cups and failed to fully convince during qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five of Italy's line-up at kick-off here started the final of the last Euros three years ago, with a new-look team featuring Bologna centre-back Riccardo Calafiori winning just his third cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albania, though, are appearing at just their second major tournament having also gone to Euro 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The novelty of the experience for them helps explain why the home of Borussia Dortmund was a sea of excitable Albanian fans decked in red and black who made up the vast majority of the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They could hardly believe it when their team, coached by the Brazilian former Arsenal and Barcelona left-back Sylvinho, opened the scoring almost straight from kick-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's Federico Dimarco took a throw from the left-back position but played it loosely back into his own box. Bastoni was caught on the back foot, and Bajrami – who plays in Italy for Sassuolo – pounced to control and fire past Gianluigi Donnarumma at the goalkeeper's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar start to Italy's last European Championship match, when Luke Shaw put England ahead inside two minutes in the final at Wembley in 2021 before the Azzurri came back to win on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time they drew level when Dimarco and Lorenzo Pellegrini played a short corner routine on the left before the latter crossed for Inter Milan centre-back Bastoni to head in at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy had regained their composure and soon went in front on 16 minutes, a Jasir Asani clearance dropping straight to another Inter player in Barella, who made the cleanest of contacts at the edge of the area to send a first-time shot past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They should have added to their lead before the interval, with Davide Frattesi hitting the post after meeting a lovely reverse pass by Gianluca Scamacca in the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scamacca was then denied by Strakosha, while Fedrico Chiesa curled a shot just wide on the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy then sat back, but Albania did not manage another attempt on target and the second-lowest ranked nation in the competition could not find an equaliser despite their best efforts late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Rey Manaj came closest after getting in behind in the 90th minute, but he could not beat Donnarumma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Spain made a dream start to Euro 2024 as Alvaro Morata scored in a statement 3-0 victory over Croatia in Berlin, with Lamine Yamal becoming the youngest player in the competition's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time European champions have often been accused of being toothless in attack during recent major tournaments, but produced an eye-catching display at the Olympiastadion to cut apart a disappointing Croatia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morata broke the deadlock in the 29th minute with his seventh Euros goal, moving joint-third on the all-time list alongside Alan Shearer and Antoine Griezmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fabian Ruiz added a second shortly afterwards with a wonderful individual strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal made his mark with the assist for Dani Carvajal to effectively kill the game as a contest on the stroke of half-time, while Croatia striker Bruno Petkovic missed a late penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This repeat of last year's Nations League final, won by Spain on penalties after a 0-0 draw, suggests La Roja are capable of contending for a record-breaking fourth European Championship title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Cup semi-finalists Croatia, though, have it all to do if they are to reach the knockout phase for a fifth consecutive major tournament, with games against Albania and holders Italy to come in a difficult Group B.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luka Modric, so often their inspiration, was substituted midway through the second half by coach Zlatko Dalic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain boss Luis de la Fuente named an exciting starting XI, including wingers Nico Williams and Yamal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Barcelona starlet, 16 years and 338 days old, beat the previous record for youngest player at a Euros held by Polish international Kacper Kozlowski, who played at Euro 2020 at 17 years and 246 days old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia enjoyed the vast majority of support from the stands, with their fans holding up one huge banner during their national anthem, reading "When we get going, heaven and earth will burn".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Croatia started slowly, as Spain dominated possession in trademark fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain also showed their increasing versatility under De la Fuente with their first goal, as one excellent through ball from inside his own half by Ruiz sent Morata clean through and the captain made no mistake with a cool finish past a stranded Dominik Livakovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz put Spain in total control just three minutes later, jinking past two Croatia defenders inside the box before shooting through the legs of Josip Sutalo and into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia almost pulled one back immediately as the game started to echo the end-to-end nature of the two teams' thrilling last-16 clash at Euro 2020, won 5-3 by Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon got down quickly to keep out Marcelo Brozovic's shot and Lovro Majer could only find the side-netting from the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia continued to create chances, as Josko Gvardiol's cross-cum-shot narrowly avoided both Ante Budimir in the centre and the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But full-back Carvajal, who scored the opening goal in Real Madrid's Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund earlier this month, put the game to bed in first-half added time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal collected the ball after a corner was cleared and curled a delicious cross into the middle for Carvajal to stretch and stab home on the volley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia tried to press forward early in the second period but left spaces for Spain to exploit and Yamal was denied another record for youngest Euros scorer when Livakovic produced a fine save to turn away his low effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Cucurella, a controversial selection by De la Fuente at left-back, made a goal-saving block to prevent Josip Stanisic giving Croatia hope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Petkovic thought he had pulled one back late on when he tapped in after his penalty was saved by Simon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the goal was ruled out by VAR for encroachment by Ivan Perisic as Spain added a clean sheet to an almost perfect outing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 250,000 people took to the streets across France on Saturday to protest the rise of the far right after their success in European polls prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call legislative elections, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police estimated 75,000 people had responded to a call from unions, associations and a new left-wing political coalition formed for the parliamentary elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CGT union put the figure at 640,000 protesters at a total of 182 rallies including 250,000 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Bayonne in the southwest to Nice in the southeast, from Vannes in the west to Reims in the east, demonstrators mobilised against the prospect of a victory for the far right in the legislative elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If that were to happen, National Rally (RN) party leader Jordan Bardella could become prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I would never see the far right come to power and now it could happen," said Florence David, 60, who took part in the Paris protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No need to vote RN to love France," was among the slogans used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marches took place mostly in calm, apart from a few brief episodes of tension in Rennes and Nantes in western France where a few dozen hard-left activists were pushed back by the police with tear gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, street infrastructure was damaged and a bank branch was targeted by hooded protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police there were also the target of bottles thrown to which they responded with tear gas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China have posted their third straight win in the FIVB Women’s Volleyball Nations League being held in Hong Kong, rallying past the world’s top-ranked side Turkey on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China lost the first two sets 21-25, 17-25 before staging their comeback, taking the next three sets 25-21, 25-23, 15-13 to win 3-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Cai Bin called it a team victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China next play Poland on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese women’s volleyball team have already qualified for the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss by Turkey means Brazil have replaced them as the world’s No 1 team.

    Israel army says eight soldiers killed in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said eight soldiers were killed in Gaza on Saturday when the armoured vehicle they were in exploded, in one of the deadliest blows for the army since the war began in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Captain Wassem Mahmud, 23, and seven other soldiers "fell during operational activity in southern Gaza," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their families have been notified."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked if the soldiers died when the Namer armoured vehicle they were travelling in exploded, a military press desk officer said: "Yes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said the explosion struck near Gaza's far-southern city of Rafah, where troops are engaged in fierce street battles with Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses were among the heaviest for the military since it began its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-one soldiers were killed on January 22 when rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire hit a tank near two buildings where they were carrying out an operation, the military said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buildings exploded as troops had planted explosives in them after the structures had been identified as "terrorist infrastructure" in the area, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's deaths take to 306 the military's losses since October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,296 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Aberg chases win in US Open debut, Scheffler struggles

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ludvig Aberg could become the first golfer in 111 years to win the US Open on his debut. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757610_1_20240616003007.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ludvig Aberg, trying to become the first US Open debut winner since 1913, carried a one-stroke lead into Saturday's third round at Pinehurst, where top-ranked Scottie Scheffler was 11 strokes adrift.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's sixth-ranked Aberg stood on five-under 135 as he awaited a 3:35 p.m. (1935 GMT) start alongside 2020 US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a runner-up effort in last month's PGA Championship, DeChambeau was among eight of 12 LIV Golf starters among the 74 players who made the cut for the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also one stroke off the pace with DeChambeau on 136 were ninth-ranked American Patrick Cantlay and Belgium's Thomas Detry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland was another shot back on 137 with American Tony Finau and France's Matthieu Pavon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner takes US$4.3 million and the runner-up a hefty US$2.32 million from the record US$21.5 million purse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Aberg, runner-up at April's Masters in his major debut, could carry off a bit of history as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not since 20-year-old American amateur Francis Ouimet upset Britain's Harry Vardon and Ted Ray at The Country Club in his hometown of Brookline, Massachusetts, some 111 years ago has a player won the US Open on his debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Swede has had triumphs on the US PGA Tour and DP World Tour since turning professional a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A major reason for his lead at punishing Pinehurst, with its dome-shaped elevated greens and dirt and weeds waste areas, is that he leads all players in both driving accuracy at 93 percent and greens in regulation at 83 percent, mainly avoiding the course's two major danger zones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best any Swedish player has done in a US Open is fourth, a feat managed by Niclas Fasth, Robert Karlson and Henrik Stenson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scheffler, the hottest golfer entering the week and a huge favourite, was six-over and 11 strokes back after a bogey at the par-4 fourth, finding native area left off the tee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler made the cut on the number following a 74 on Friday but was 1-over after seven holes on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was the first player since Tom Watson in 1980 to win five US PGA Tour events before the US Open, taking the fifth last week at the Memorial, and has 12 top-10 finishes in 13 events this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The usually stoic and calm Scheffler, however, could feel the frustration at Pinehurst's unique challenge, flipping his putter in the air and letting it fall after one near miss on Friday and also slamming down his driver after a woefully errant tee shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay, in his best spot after 36 holes in 30 major starts, has a chance to move past Collin Morikawa for the final spot on the US team for the Paris Olympics but needs no worse than a two-way share of second to do it. Four other Americans must win to make the squad for France. (AFP)

 Ex-Premier League striker Kevin Campbell has died aged 54, his former clubs Arsenal and Everton announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who died after a short illness, holds the record for most Premier League goals, 83, by a player never to win an international cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Arsenal Football is devastated to hear of the death of our much-loved former player Kevin Campbell," said Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell joined the Gunners as a schoolboy in 1985, making his first-team debut in 1988. He went on to play 228 times for Arsenal scoring 59 goals and winning a league title, an FA Cup, a European Cup Winners Cup and a League Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To actually play for the team I supported was a dream come true," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 164 games for Everton he scored 51 goals, including nine in five games which saved them from relegation in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Everton Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of the Club's most popular and much-loved former strikers, Kevin Campbell," they said on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who also played for Leicester, Leyton Orient, Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff, said one of his favourite memories in football was scoring the winner in the 2000 Merseyside derby, Everton's last victory at Anfield for 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was at the Kop End and my view, which will live with me until the day I die, is the Blues in the Kop going crazy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2001, manager Walter Smith made Campbell Everton's first black captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He made me the first black captain of Everton, which is something that I'm so proud of," Campbell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell moved to West Brom in January 2005 and was part of their "great escape," as they became the first club bottom of the Premier League at Christmas to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His son, Tyrese Campbell, is a striker who has just been released by Championship side Stoke City after seven seasons at the club. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland made a flying start at Euro 2024 as Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer scored their first international goals in a 3-1 win against Hungary on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murat Yakin's side raced into a two-goal lead by half-time in Cologne to kick off their Group A campaign in impressive fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah opened the scoring in only his second international appearance after making his debut earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-born 27-year-old, who plays for Bulgarian club Ludogorets Razgrad, holds dual citizenship with Ghana and Switzerland, who will be relieved he opted to represent them on the evidence of this dynamic display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After providing the assist for Duah's opener, Bologna midfielder Aebischer netted his maiden Switzerland goal with an eye-catching long-range strike just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barnabas Varga's seventh goal in nine starts for Hungary set up a tense finale, but Breel Embolo struck in stoppage-time to seal the points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following reports of a rift between Yakin and his players over tactics, Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka insisted on Friday that the air had been cleared in time for the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent dinner with Yakin featuring "plenty of wine" healed the wounds and the Bayer Leverkusen midfielder showed his support for the manager with an influential performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland beat France on penalties in the last 16 at Euro 2020 before losing a shoot-out to Spain in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will hope to emulate that memorable run after enjoying a perfect start in a group that also includes hosts Germany, who thrashed Scotland 5-1 in the tournament opener on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland face Scotland in their second game on Wednesday, while Hungary play Germany the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary boss Marco Rossi had urged his side to embrace the pressure of being ranked as one of Europe's emerging forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But their dismal first half proved fatal, showing that comparisons to Hungary's 'Mighty Magyars', who finished as runners-up at the 1954 World Cup, were rather premature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland needed just 12 minutes to puncture Hungarian optimism in ruthless fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aebischer slipped a perfectly weighted pass through the heart of the Hungary defence, sending Duah through to plant a clinical low finish past Peter Gulacsi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah's celebrations were initially curtailed by an erroneous offside flag, but the decision was corrected by the VAR as Switzerland's players mobbed their unheralded hero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruben Vargas should have sent the roiling red sea of Switzerland fans into ecstasy again moments later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vargas intercepted Milos Kerkez's wayward pass on the edge of the area, but the winger was left holding his head in frustration after his shot cannoned off Gulacsi's shoulder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss were on a roll and Willi Orban wasted a golden opportunity to halt their momentum with a close-range header that was straight at Yann Sommer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crucial moment as Aebischer doubled Switzerland's lead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Hungary sat too deep, a flowing Swiss move climaxed with Aebischer curling a superb strike into the far corner from 25 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga gave Hungary a lifeline in the 66th minute, just moments after he had missed a sitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominik Szoboszlai's pin-point cross found Varga and his diving header whistled past Sommer from six yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary pushed hard for an equaliser, but Embolo came off the bench to chip a cool finish over Gulacsi in the final seconds. (AFP)

    Ukraine summit seeking peace plan opens in Switzerland

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling the summit the first step towards a just peace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757607_1_20240615232721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders were joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Switzerland on Saturday for a summit on peace in his country, but with Russia staying away it is seen as the first step in a long process.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Swiss hosts have sought to temper expectations at the two-day gathering, with an agenda laying the groundwork for a path to peace – with future summits envisioned, eventually involving Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky himself expressed high hopes for the outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see history being made here at the summit," he said on social media platform Telegram, as he greeted presidents and prime ministers arriving at the luxury Burgenstock resort high above Lake Lucerne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we are making the first step toward just peace based on the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law," he said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a combative speech on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the conference and demanded that Kyiv effectively surrender before any actual peace negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky branded Putin's demands a territorial "ultimatum" reminiscent of Nazi Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler, while Nato and the United States also immediately rejected the hardline conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conference, convening exactly 100 countries and global institutions, comes at a perilous moment for exhausted Ukrainians and outgunned soldiers, more than two years since Moscow launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50 heads of state and government figure among the attendees, including all of the G7 leaders who have been meeting in Italy – with one notable exception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden instead sent his Vice President Kamala Harris, who announced more than US$1.5 billion in new aid for Ukraine, mainly for its energy sector and in humanitarian assistance as she arrived in a US Army helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are attending, as is the European Union chief and the leaders of Colombia, Chile, Finland, Ghana, Kenya and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentinian President Javier Milei and the presidents of Ecuador and Fiji were among the early arrivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Brics allies Brazil and South Africa are meanwhile only sending an envoy, and India will be represented at the ministerial level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is absent, insisting it will not take part without Moscow's presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost a year of stalemate, Ukraine was forced to abandon dozens of frontline settlements this spring, with Russian troops holding a significant advantage in manpower and resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near Ukraine's embattled eastern front, hopes for any major breakthrough are nearly nil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to hope that it will bring some changes in the future. But, as experience shows, nothing comes of it," said Maksym, a tank commander the Donetsk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Kyiv, Victoria, a 36-year-old energy industry worker, said she was "exhausted" by the war and wanted to believe the summit would help end it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, she said, "I'm a realist in life, so I don't have high hopes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts have also warned against unrealistic expectations from the gathering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meaningful negotiations that could truly end the devastating war in Ukraine remain out of reach, as both Kyiv and Moscow stick to theories of victory that amount to outlasting the other," the International Crisis Group think tank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit aims to find paths towards a lasting peace for Ukraine based on international law and the United Nations Charter; a possible framework to achieve this goal; and a roadmap as to how both parties could come together in a future peace process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A plenary session involving all delegations will be held on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three topics will be discussed in detail in working groups: nuclear safety, freedom of navigation and food security, and humanitarian aspects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second summit is envisaged. Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Tuesday that Kyiv hoped Russia would attend and receive a "joint plan" presented by the other attendees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the Rand think tank, said of the Burgenstock summit: "Russia is clearly going out of its way to demonstrate its pique with it... That tells you something.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Avoiding the expansion of the pro-Ukraine coalition – they're concerned about this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since mid-May, Russian military progress has slowed and Zelensky hopes to swing the momentum further with the back-to-back G7 and peace summits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky arrived at Burgenstock on Friday evening after the G7 summit agreed to offer a new US$50-billion loan for Ukraine, using profits from the interest on frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A landmark 10-year security deal signed by Zelensky and Biden on Thursday will see the United States provide Ukraine with military aid and training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, the European Union's 27 member states agreed "in principle" on beginning accession negotiations with Ukraine. (AFP)
