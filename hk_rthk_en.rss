<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong must not put all its eggs in one basket and should step up efforts to explore new market opportunities, according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister acknowledged that despite high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, the SAR's economy was on target to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent for the full year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau felt there was a need for businesses to diversify their investment portfolio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are seeing many opportunities around, especially in new economies in central Asia, central Europe, eastern Europe," he told reporters at a press event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed he was planning an upcoming duty visit to Peru in November, while there are plans to set up government outposts in Egypt and Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be helping the motherland for inviting investment from all those new economies using Hong Kong as a gateway into the mainland," Yau added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event to promote Hong Kong's industries, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said a sprawling technology park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop is going ahead full steam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed that the first three buildings within the park would be completed later this year, and authorities were still deciding how to carve out 87 hectares of space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The park will be developed in two phases - the western side will provide around one million square metres of office space for different sectors such as artificial intelligence," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will also be accommodation and ancillary facilities for professionals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The I&T minister had previously said that dozens of tech enterprises had expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics sectors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong stocks ended the week with another loss on Friday as data showing inflation slowing in the United States was offset by the Federal Reserve lowering its outlook for interest rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index lost 0.94 percent, or 170 points, to finish at 17,941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.12 percent to 3,032, while the Shenzhen Composite on China's second exchange slipped 0.37 percent, to finish six points lower. (AFP)

    GBA has edge over San Francisco in finance: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub has provided a "competitive advantage" to the Greater Bay Area in financial services over its counterpart in San Francisco, according to the financial chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One distinctive feature of the SAR, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a media interview, was the opportunity for companies to list on the city's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have Hong Kong, in the Greater Bay Area, being an international financial centre. We can marry both technological innovation and financial services to prosper. And this is the distinction between Hong Kong and San Francisco," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you want to develop and grow the innovation and technology sector, you need a lot of capital... But also you need to have an [international financial centre], a listing platform."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite that, Chan said there were similarities between the two bay areas in southern China and California, with the two being "economic powerhouses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign investment to the Greater Bay Area, the financial chief said the SAR remained attractive and competitive amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given this geopolitical tension, the capital market would be more volatile. Certain funding, say for example, funding from the US, may reduce their allocation to this part of the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in our engagement with the investing sector in the US, they are still very keen in the Greater Bay Area and the development of China, because they believe this is the growing future. And using the Greater Bay Area is not just for the Chinese market, but also for the Asia market as a whole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said local authorities were working hard to reach out to the international community and host mega events to clear up misunderstandings about the city, while also bringing about more than HK$10 billion into the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief also said the number of arrivals this year had risen thanks to the expansion of the solo travel scheme, allowing mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis instead of in tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combined with a rise in consumption, hopes of lower interest rates in the near future, and the resumption of international flights, Hong Kong's economy is estimated to grow between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's property prices, which plunged by almost a quarter from its historic high in September 2021 to February this year, Chan said it's normal for housing costs to adjust amid high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed out that both home prices and the number of transactions had risen after the government scrapped all property-cooling measures in February.

    CE confident in GBA opportunities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he believed there were many opportunities to explore in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Hong Kong could contribute with its unique strengths as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking with the media on the issue, Lee said Hong Kong would achieve greater benefits through cooperation with mainland counterparts in terms of technology and talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology integration is important. We contribute what we have been good at, such as research, such as high quality education, and then we combine that with the high quality research and talent in the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a strength of attracting both international talent, as well as mainland talent, and Hong Kong has been nurturing local talent. So Hong Kong has again the advantage of having the beauty of three areas, local, mainland and international. And that I think is a unique strength of Hong Kong in developing talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the city's future role as a financial hub amid growing concerns about geopolitical tensions between East and West, Lee expressed confidence in the investment and market sentiment despite the uncertainty and added risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wise investors look at markets in the long term. They know at the end, the market is always right. Politics doesn't affect the market in the long term. It will have an effect, but smart investors will find a way to absorb that political consideration and make very wise decisions based on economic development and economic opportunities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added he accomplished two important tasks in the two years since he took office, including enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and completing the District Council elections.

 Premier Li Qiang said on Friday that Beijing is willing to make efforts to upgrade the China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Addressing a welcome banquet in Auckland held by various social communities on day two of his visit to New Zealand, Li also said the momentum of China's economic recovery has continued to strengthen and consolidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier said the upgrading of China's economic structure will bring new opportunities for global development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will always be open to enterprises from New Zealand and other countries, Li added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier earlier visited the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research, a government agency tasked with promoting the country's farming, food and beverage industries, before meetings and a dinner with business people, academics and diplomats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mark Piper, the chief executive of a top New Zealand government science institute, was among those meeting Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was talking about more research collaborations and more people exchanges, which is what we're really interested in," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was really big on collaboration, the value that New Zealand can bring to China and that China can bring to New Zealand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li is due to travel to Australia on Saturday. He'll also visit Malaysia as part of his three-nation trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

    Millions gather in Mecca for Hajj pilgrimage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Muslim worshippers pray around the Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757438_1_20240614154349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 1.5 million pilgrims from around the world have amassed in and around Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage in which the faithful circle the cube-shaped Kaaba in the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of pilgrims was still growing as more from inside Saudi Arabia joined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities expected the number of pilgrims to exceed two million this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which pushed the entire Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran and its proxies on the other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinians in Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip’s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian authorities said 4,200 pilgrims from the occupied West Bank arrived in Mecca for Hajj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities said 1,000 more from the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the war in Gaza also arrived to perform Hajj at the invitation of King Salman of Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,000 invitees were already outside Gaza — mostly in Egypt — before closure of the Rafah crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, involves a series of rituals in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia that take several days to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the five pillars of Islam, it must be performed at least once by all Muslims who have the means to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After travelling from all parts of the globe to Islam's holiest city, the pilgrims will first perform the "tawaf" -- circling seven times around the Kaaba.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will then head towards Mina, a valley surrounded by craggy mountains several kilometres outside Mecca, where they will spend the night in air-conditioned tents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The climax will come on Saturday with day-long prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilgrims in white garments have already been circling the Kaaba in large numbers for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some have waited for years for the chance to make the trip, with permits allocated by Saudi authorities on a quota basis for each country. (Agencies)

    Cigarettes ban won't affect tourism: Lo Chung-mau

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Friday brushed aside lawmakers' concerns that banning vaping and flavoured cigarettes would make Hong Kong a less attractive destination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government last week put forward 10 measures to cut the number of smokers in the city, including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Starry Lee said Hong Kong would be less competitive when compared with other international financial centres which allow smoking, such as London, while retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the ban would discourage travellers from visiting Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lo said people did not come to Hong Kong just to smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most tourists who come to Hong Kong are non-smokers. Non-smokers always outnumber smokers. When they come to Hong Kong, they don't come to Hong Kong just to smoke. They come to Hong Kong to identify business opportunities. They want to experience our culinary experiences, tourism experiences, and so on,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So when we have a tobacco-free, vibrant, and healthy Hong Kong, it’s always better to have a city that is [free] of smoke.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers also raised concerns about the limitations in enforcement, with election committee sector lawmaker Chan Pui-leung saying there were staff shortages at the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office, and the definition of a queue was ambiguous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, catering sector lawmaker Tommy Cheung said the government should allocate more resources to educate the youth about the dangers of smoking, rather than solely focusing on banning cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister explained that creating a tobacco-free Hong Kong would require more than just enforcement efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In fact, it's not just about relying on law enforcement, but also about using certain enforcement measures to establish a culture, a norm, so that everyone will know in which areas smoking is prohibited. It can also be said that everyone is a smoking control ambassador.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.

    ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757423_1_20240614141154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC has arrested 20 people in connection with an alleged vehicle-testing scam.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body accused staff of a designated private testing centre of accepting advantages from garage proprietors or middlemen, and helping private cars that did not meet the required standards to pass the exhaust emission test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those arrested were staff of a designated testing centre, owners of three garages in the New Territories, middlemen as well as contract workers of the Transport Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten private cars were also seized in the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the Transport Department’s requirements, all private cars manufactured for over six years must undergo an annual examination at designated test centres in order to renew their vehicle licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The genuine fee for the examination is HK$585. What was happening was that the owners were paying a one-stop shop price for all the service. That was between HK$2,000 and HK$3,000,” said ICAC principal investigator David Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the difference between those two prices is the benefits that were made for both parties in either the garage owner would get business from the customers or the testing centre staff would be receiving some of that in bribery money.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams said staff at the testing centre substituted the results of cars that they knew would fail with those that had already passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said about 20 cars were referred by the garages to pass the examination fraudulently every month, and it's still trying to find out how long the syndicate has been in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Red Cross on Friday held a blood donation drive to mark World Blood Donor Day, with transfusion centres set up around town.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chief executive and medical director of the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Dr Lee Cheuk-kwong, called on the public to donate blood with inventory being low in the past few weeks due to weather, adding that blood has a limited shelf life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whenever there is rain, particularly heavy rain, people may just stay at home or go to shopping malls instead of going out to donations, so this is one of the limiting factors. Also, in rainy days, some companies may not be able to work with us in arranging the blood donation drive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Blood donations are still needed for many types of medical treatment and at the moment there's no replacement, so we need people to come out for donations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He especially called on people with blood types O and A to come forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the service has been targeting young people, especially university students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past few years after the pandemic, we have resumed some programmes in the young donors recruitment, in particular in the university," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Visiting schools remains one of our main objectives in our current recruitment strategies. Only the problem for us is fewer classes and students in the secondary schools, with those eligible mostly in form four, five and six."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The service collected a total of 210,103 units of blood in 2023, with just over 124,000 donors. Both figures were up from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the donation process is straightforward and rewarding, adding that each donation saves three lives.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757394_1_20240614120446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government has rejected an annual report on the SAR by the European Commission, saying it had "unfounded and biased content" on issues such as safeguarding national security and human rights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the administration also urged the European Union (EU) to stop interfering in the territory's affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability by slandering the city's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the commission outlined the political and economic developments in the SAR in 2023, pointing to the city's national security law and relevant court trials, as well as district council elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These developments undermine trust in the rule of law in Hong Kong and affect Hong Kong’s standing as an international business hub," said commission vice-president Josep Borrell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the report also noted "hopeful signs of progress on the rights of LGBTI+ people in Hong Kong, mainly carried forward by the judiciary", as well as substantial commercial links between the SAR and the EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration stressed that the city's national security laws were "precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also better safeguards the fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents of the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and other people, including those doing business, in the city," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU must immediately act reasonably and sensibly, and stop smearing the laws safeguarding national security in the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aleksander Barkov and Sergei Bobrovsky led the way as the Florida Panthers moved within a victory of their first Stanley Cup title, holding on to beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 in Game 3 of the final Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Game 4 is on Sunday morning, Hong Kong time. The Panthers have not won a championship since coming into the NHL in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barkov set up a goal and scored another, while Bobrovsky made 32 saves. Sam Reinhart, Sam Bennett and Vladimir Tarasenko also scored, with the Panthers pouncing on turnovers and quieting a fired up Edmonton crowd until the Oilers mounted a third-period rally that fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will take a comeback done just four times in league playoff history and once in the final – back in 1942 – to bring the Cup back to Canada. (AP)

    G7 leaders pledge support for Ukraine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a 10-year security agreement on Thursday that they hailed as a milestone in relations between their countries, but that alone was not enough to stop Zelenskyy from wondering how much longer he could count on America's support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy also said his country “urgently” needed additional air defence systems to protect Ukrainians and the nation's infrastructure from Russia's continued bombardment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders signed the agreement on the sidelines of the annual Group of Seven summit, and Biden said the goal "is to strengthen Ukraine's defence and deterrence capabilities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference that the signing made for a “truly historic day,” but he also wondered about the durability of support from the United States and other allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's president said the right question to ask is “for how long the unity in the world will remain?" and how it will be influenced by the outcome of elections this year in many of those countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the first day of their meeting in southern Italy, G7 nations agreed on a deal to provide US$50 billion of loans for Ukraine backed by interest from frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although many details still need to be worked out, G7 members and the European Union are expected to contribute to the loan, with cash to reach Kyiv by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very historic step we're taking today," said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. "It is also a clear signal to the Russian President (Vladimir Putin), that he can't just sit this out and hope that fiscal problems in a country that backs Ukraine will one day let him win this war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  G7 leaders are also expected to discuss China and immigration in their summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pope Francis is also putting in a historic appearance at the G7 meeting, discussing artificial intelligence and holding multiple bilateral meetings including with Biden, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a historic day. We will welcome the Holy Father. It is the first time for a pontiff at a G7. I am proud it will happen under the Italian presidency," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told reporters on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests were staged near the summit venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators voiced support for Palestinians and accused the G7 of failing to do more in environmental protection. (AP/Reuters)

    China firms apply for EU pork import probe: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China imported US$6 billion worth of pork in 2023. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757395_1_20240614110707.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese firms have formally applied for an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports from the European Union, the Global Times newspaper said, after the bloc's decision to impose anti-subsidy duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China imported US$6 billion worth of pork in 2023, including offal, with the EU accounting for more than half, customs data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Global Times report gave no details of the anti-dumping probe, and it was unclear which pork products would be targeted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pig parts that are not favoured in Europe such as feet, ears and offal are popular among Chinese consumers, providing a valuable and important market for Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain was China's top supplier last year, followed by Brazil and the United States. Other major suppliers are France, Denmark and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had said it would take "all necessary measures" to safeguard its interests in the wake of the EU decision to slap tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicles made in China, which is due to take effect from July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EV tariffs drew a strong rebuke from China as well as European and Chinese car makers, with industry insiders saying both Europe and China have reasons to strike a deal in the months ahead, as the EU process allows for review. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy rain of up to 100 millimetres an hour was recorded in parts of Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long as bad weather hit the city on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 50 millimetres of rain was recorded in other parts of the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The red rainstorm warning was in effect from 10am to 11.30am, before it was downgraded to the amber rainstorm warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said serious road flooding and traffic congestion could disrupt normal school hours and people should carefully consider the conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said all afternoon schools have been suspended. It also said morning and whole-day schools that were in session should continue until the end of school hours, and ensure that conditions are safe before allowing students to return home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Classes of evening schools are expected to proceed as usual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department is calling on members of the public to report any flooding, while the Labour Department said employers should ensure the safety of workers.

    LPH quality same as public housing, says NGO

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy director of NGO Society for Community Organization says the quality of the first batch of light public housing matches that of standard public housing, while the rental levels are much cheaper than subdivided flats and 90 percent of standard public housing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Actually, they're quite similar to public housing... only the kitchen is open," said Sze Lai-shan while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze also said the facilities were similar to transitional social housing, which is provided by government-supported NGOs. She said in some cases it was even better as the units were new and there were electrical appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday the government said applications would open later this month for 4,400 of the temporary units in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long. The temporary modular units are intended for people in the queue for public housing, and those who take up the offer of light public housing will remain on the public housing list. Priority will be given to those with urgent needs, such as those living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze said some potential tenants were concerned about how many buses they would need to take, as the new units weren't linked to the MTR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, first introduced the idea of light public housing in his policy address two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the new units will range from HK$740 to HK$2,650.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Cantlay racked up six birdies and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy played a bogey-free round on their ways to 5-under-par 65s to share the lead through the first round of the U.S. Open on Thursday in Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cantlay established the lead early in the day, and McIlroy, the 2011 champion, had birdies on two of the final three holes playing in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Ludvig Aberg shot 66 to hold third place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Golfers had to negotiate the tricky greens on Pinehurst No. 2 along with the increasing heat of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay began the round on No. 10. He got better later in the round, with four birdies on the first eight holes on the front side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Feeling good about my game," Cantlay said. "I've been working hard. I have to just keep putting myself in the fairway, giving myself opportunities and I did a good job of that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time Cantlay has led or co-led in a major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a rough day for Tiger Woods, who shot 74 with two birdies – both on the par-5 holes – and six bogeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler had a mundane 71. Defending champion Wyndham Clark managed just one birdie during his round of 73. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England thrashed Oman by eight wickets as the reigning champions revived their T20 World Cup campaign with a record-breaking success in Antigua on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a heavy win to bolster their net run-rate [NRR] as they attempt to overhaul Scotland in the race to qualify for the second-round Super Eights, England dismissed Oman for just 47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England then made 50-2 in a mere 3.1 overs, captain Jos Buttler 24 not out and Jonny Bairstow, who hit the winning boundary, unbeaten on eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This overwhelming Group B victory meant England recorded the largest win in T20 World Cup history in terms of balls remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oman had no answer to England's combination of spin and pace, leg-break bowler Adil Rashid taking 4-11 from his four overs, while express quicks Jofra Archer and Mark Wood both had figures of 3-12 in an innings that ended with nearly seven overs to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Number seven Shoaib Khan [11] was the only Oman batsman to reach double figures after Buttler won the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Significantly, England's NRR climbed to 3.081, better than Scotland's 2.16. England, however, stayed third on three points, behind Scotland's five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already-eliminated Oman, who ended the tournament having lost all four of the games, just scraped past the record lowest completed total of 39 at any T20 World Cup, posted by fellow-non Test nation Uganda against co-hosts West Indies in Guyana last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, beaten by Australia after their group game with Scotland was abandoned due to rain, play Namibia on Saturday.

  Australia and Scotland, however, will meet on Sunday after England have completed their group games. (AFP)

    Battles rage in Rafah, US says Gaza truce possible

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli helicopters struck Gaza's Rafah on Thursday, residents said, with Hamas reporting street battles in the southern city after top US diplomat Antony Blinken said a truce was still possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the war raged on, and tensions soared on Israel's northern border with more attacks by Lebanon's Hezbollah forces targeting military positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, which has traded near-daily fire with Hamas ally Hezbollah since the start of the Gaza war, said it would respond "with force".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli ground forces have been operating in Rafah since early May, despite widespread alarm over the fate of Palestinian civilians there, including in a ruling by the International Court of Justice later that month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western areas of Rafah came under heavy fire on Thursday from the air, sea and land, residents said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said its fighters were battling Israeli troops on the streets in the city, near the besieged Gaza Strip's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Efforts to reach a truce stalled when Israel began ground operations in Rafah, but US President Joe Biden in late May launched a new effort to secure a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday the UN Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution supporting the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken, in Doha on Wednesday to promote Biden's ceasefire roadmap, said Washington would work with regional partners to "close the deal".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said the group sought "a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal" of Israeli troops from Gaza, demands repeatedly rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan includes a six-week ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner exchange and Gaza reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would be the first truce since a week-long November pause in fighting saw hostages freed and Palestinians released from Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said Israel was behind the plan, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government has far-right members strongly opposed to the deal, has not publicly endorsed it. (AFP)

    Fresh data signals weakness in US jobs market

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A “Help Wanted” sign hangs in a restaurant window in Medford, Massachusetts. There are now signs that the US jobs market is weakening as new claims for unemployment benefits climb. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757342_1_20240613224642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a 10-month high last week, suggesting the labour market was losing momentum and keeping hopes of a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve alive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was reinforced by other data from the Labour Department on Thursday showing producer prices unexpectedly falling in May. The largest decline in prices at the factory gate since last October followed news on Wednesday that consumer prices were unchanged in May. The US central bank on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25 percent-5.5 percent range, where it has been since last July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with policymakers projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists, however, remained optimistic that the Fed would reduce borrowing costs twice this year, starting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These data nudge the door a little wider open for the Fed to start cutting interest rates later this year," said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 242,000 for the week ended June 8, the highest level since last August, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims in the latest week. It was the third straight weekly rise in claims, leading some economists to believe that cracks were forming in the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others blamed the rise on lingering volatility related to the Memorial Day holiday in late May. (Reuters)

 The Chinese University's School of Continuing and Professional Studies on Thursday said the personal information of more than 20,000 students, staff, faculty and visitors has been hacked.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school said it found out last week that its online learning platform had been breached, compromising data such as names, emails as well as student numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was contacting those affected and that their personal details were not appearing on the dark web.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has been notified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school added that it is improving cybersecurity to try to prevent a repeat of the incident.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice said on Thursday that it has filed an appeal against the acquittal of one of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were cleared of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law last month, with three High Court judges saying in their verdict that they were not sure if the pair had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice said it has filed an appeal against Lau's acquittal, but that it won't challenge the judgement regarding Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen others were found guilty of the subversion offence and 31 pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitigation hearings for those convicted will begin later this month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said there are no plans to keep a makeshift hospital in Lok Ma Chau open longer than originally planned, despite its high usage and positive responses from patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital in the Lok Ma Chau Loop area was originally designed to treat Covid-19 patients. It was later turned into a temporary hospital as part of a trial to improve public healthcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The temporary facility began operation in April 2023 and is scheduled to run until 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Sin Ngai-chuen, clinical stream coordinator of the New Territories East Cluster, said the plan is to operate “as long as we can” and follow the directions of the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital, by default, is a temporary building in nature. Of course, it can last for a bit longer in terms of years, but it's not going to be long-lasting because this infrastructure and all the basic facilities are going to be just temporary,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But certainly the result we have obtained here is very encouraging in terms of a pilot scheme. So we will wrap up the findings and experience and we'll try and come up with a possible future development plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital offers a variety of medical services, including diagnostic radiology, endoscopy, drug-resistant organism screening and sleep studies, and is now extending services to include vitamin D pathology tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA said as of the end of May, the hospital had conducted more than 18,000 tests with its medical-imaging services, about 4,000 more than originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median waiting times for patients to get a CT scan, MRI scan and ultrasound scan have all been reduced, from up to 140 weeks to as short as 25 weeks, it noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And about 690 patients have taken part in the sleep studies at the hospital, with the waiting times up to three years shorter than at a general public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sin said the HA will learn from its experience with the makeshift hospital and study the possibility of diverting more patient care to outpatient facilities, to help reduce the pressure on hospitals.

    Govt to hire consultant to probe CLP power outages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the government will ask an independent consultant to investigate CLP power outages over the past three years, and the electricity company will have to pay for the cost of the probe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tse met the managing director of CLP, Joseph Law, after more than 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the frequency of glitches has led to concerns that the service quality of CLP has declined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will hire an independent consultant to investigate voltage dips and power interruptions in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will examine aspects such as safety designs, the power supply system's ability to resist external factors, repair work and preventative maintenance measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will recommend improvement measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EMSD has ordered the company to hand in a detailed report on the Wong Tai Sin outage within a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP, for its part, apologised again for the inconvenience caused by the power outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it will set up a special working group with the EMSD to review how it manages the power system, and a report will be submitted to the government within one year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Prior to the listing, Tencent subsidiary Image Frame had a stake of about 13 percent in QuantumPharm, also known as XtalPi.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of Tencent-backed QuantumPharm, also known as XtalPi, on Thursday surged during its trading debut in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It marks the first initial public offering (IPO) under the Hong Kong stock exchange's Chapter 18C listing regime which allows specialist technology companies with a minimum valuation of HK$10 billion to sell shares, even if they haven't generated profits yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shares of the artificial intelligence drug researcher closed at HK$5.8, nearly 10 percent above its IPO price of HK$5.28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Public investors oversubscribed the offer by 102 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the listing ceremony, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Chapter 18C listing regime could facilitate financing for tech companies in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre enables it to attract global capital which in turn supports technology development in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, described the listing as a significant milestone in the city's market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added it showcased China’s leading role in the innovation and technology field and Hong Kong's appeal as a global financing hub for the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to the listing, Image Frame, a Tencent subsidiary, had a stake of about 13 percent in the newly-listed company.

    Six in 10 happy with their family life: survey

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six in 10 people have given positive feedback in a survey of family happiness conducted by Hong Kong University.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The research team, which also includes academics from the department of social work at Baptist University, invited around 4,500 adults to answer an online questionnaire between July and August 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Respondents were asked to rate, on a scale of one to 10, a series of indices, including family "xingfu", a broad Chinese term for happiness and contentment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 58 percent of participants gave a score of seven or higher, compared to a mean of 6.53, the results varied according to their socio-demographic characteristics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher-income individuals and homeowners tended to be more content with their lives, as well as those who were 55 or older.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Kelvin Wang, who led the study, said the findings differed from similar polls such as the World Happiness Report jointly commissioned by the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think (the World Happiness Report) is not able to 100 percent capture the xingfu ... in Chinese groups," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the West, we all know that many things which [people] do are to pursue happiness on an individual level. But for China ... the traditional wisdom is that family is almost in a higher position than individual well-being."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers also compared the results with a separate survey measuring the so-called 3Hs in family life - health, harmony and happiness. They noted a "moderate to high" correlation between the two sets of attributes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang suggested that people make an effort to communicate with their family members and be generous in offering praise, either face-to-face or through instant messaging apps.

    HK's first LPH flats open for application on June 24

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing (LPH) will open for applications from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of modular units for people waiting for public housing was introduced during Chief Executive John Lee's policy address in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters following a media visit to the flats, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said it showed the government's determination in addressing the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is only the first batch. Our target is to provide 30,000 light public housing units by the years 2026 and 2027. All the projects are in full speed. All the projects are being pushed forward on the site," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the flats range from HK$740 to HK$2,650, and tenants were expected to move in as early as the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said priority would be given to families living in poor conditions, based on a points system, adding that people in urgent need were encouraged to submit their applications before July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example families with young children... Many organisations tell us that the changes that can bring to these families are really remarkable and very obvious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because children when they grow up, like from four years old to 10 years old, this is a very critical period...if you leave them in sub-divided units in such a poor condition, it really affects their learning, their growing up and their social abilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister added that people with disabilities, families with infants and the elderly, and those who choose remote LPH sites, would also be given extra marks under the points system.

    CLP urged to explain recent power outages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have called on CLP to give the public an explanation regarding recent power outages in the city, after over 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company says the latest blackout was caused by a faulty cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman who lives in Lung Kwong House said she struggled with the heat when her air conditioning went off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to turn on two portable fans. It lasted for four hours. I was feeling so hot. I haven't experienced such a situation since I lived here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another resident said he couldn't understand why the power company did not activate a backup system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to walk all the way up to my flat. There was no electricity, no air conditioning, and the food inside my refrigerator turned bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said there have been multiple power outages in the city in recent months and this is unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expect the government to try to intervene in the situation and ask the company [CLP] to give us the full report on how to, in the long term, make the power supply become more stable," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not looking into an individual incident. We are looking at a full picture, whether they need some fundamental changes or essential improvements, so that we can guarantee the power supply is stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs, said the threshold in the current penalty system for power companies is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said CLP would face a penalty of HK$20 million if it recorded 15 million minutes of power disruption to its customers in a year. Wednesday night's outage would have caused around one million minutes of disruption, he added.

    Lawmakers welcome East Kowloon transit system plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The smart and green mass transit system will have eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East. Photo courtesy of the Transport and Logistics Bureau" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757264_1_20240613134659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday welcomed a proposal for an elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, with the project expected to be completed in 2033.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport and Logistics Bureau submitted a proposal to the Legislative Council on Wednesday to build a seven-kilometre-long system in the area, which would include six kilometres of viaducts and one kilometre of tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The smart and green mass transit system would mainly operate on an elevated corridor, and there would be eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Bill Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, said the elevated mass transit system could solve traffic congestion in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a very, very significant step that the government has already made a decision to satisfy our Kowloon East residents' long-term request to improve our traffic needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan said the network needed to be fully integrated into the areas it served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government must ensure that each station is well connected with the residents, including setting up multiple different entries and also the interconnection system with the related housing estates," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said pedestrian facilities would be built to link the existing Choi Hung MTR Station with the proposed Choi Hung East Station, and Yau Tong MTR Station with the proposed Yau Tong East Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project is expected to be completed in 2033, but Ngan hopes the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government should also look into possibilities of linking the system up with the Kai Tak area, such as Tsz Wan Shan and Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities would seek about HK$262.5 million of funding approval from Legco’s public works subcommittee next Wednesday.

    Hydrogen development plan to be unveiled next week: CE

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee told lawmakers that the government's hydrogen development strategy will be unveiled next week." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757256_1_20240613130238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that officials will role out a development strategy on hydrogen next week, involving the development of hydrogen energy and vehicles powered by the gas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a question and answer session in Legco on the country's initiatives to develop new quality productive forces, Lee said the Environment and Ecology Bureau will announce its hydrogen plan on June 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said some laws may have to be changed to allow the safe storage and maintenance of the gas, which is easily combustible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government will look into new facilities such as hydrogen gas stations, and officials have already approved several pilot schemes involving hydrogen-powered vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We already have [hydrogen fuel cell, HFC] buses on trial now running on the streets, and you will also be seeing the launch of several other projects," the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we have plans to launch a trial project on HFC street washing vehicles, refuse collection vehicles and trams and so on. There will be trial projects too using hydrogen energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive also said the government is facing problems developing a "low-altitude economy", which is currently popular on the mainland, noting that the SAR is filled with high-rise buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB's Elizabeth Quat said there are several things Hong Kong can look into, such as helicopter transit services from the airport directly to business buildings in the Greater Bay Area, local food delivery with drones, and low-flying air tours for travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the legislature also discussed the development of cultural tourism in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Councillor Kenneth Lau, who heads the Heung Yee Kuk, proposed that the government give more funding to rural committees to promote rural cultural activities to tourists, as in-depth cultural tours are becoming more popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee agreed that rural representatives know how to design travel itineraries, and government sponsorship would depend on particular projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, lawmaker Gary Zhang, who used to work at the MTR Corporation, said there are many transport enthusiasts in the Greater Bay Area interested in the local transport culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on the authorities to build an extra rail line connecting the planned Hung Shui Kiu Station with Sunny Bay and the Airport Express, so that travellers can get to Lantau and the airport easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he agreed with connecting the Airport Express to more lines, saying officials will seriously look into whether this would be feasible.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and New Zealand on Thursday signed agreements on trade and climate change during Premier Li Qiang's visit to the country, the highest level Chinese visit in seven years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li also expressed the hope that New Zealand can support Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership when he met Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on the first day of his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the talks, the Premier was greeted on the lawns of Government House in the capital Wellington by Luxon and participated in a traditional indigenous Maori welcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the meeting, Li said that the two agreed that it is important to expand cooperation on trade and investment and that China is ready to be part of New Zealand's efforts to double its value of exports in the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Premier said Beijing will also extend visa-free travel to New Zealanders, while New Zealand will support Chinese language teaching and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agreed that it is important to promote the sustained sound and steady development of China and New Zealand relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to view and handle bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective to lay a solid political foundation of our cooperation in all fields.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said he expressed the hope that New Zealand could support the SAR in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement. Hong Kong officially requested to join RCEP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luxon for his part said they discussed the two country's significant economic relationship, with two-way trade in goods worth nearly 22.4 billion US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and New Zealand have different political systems and as with all of our long standing relationships, it is natural that we will raise our differences with China consistently and predictably," Luxon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li will later visit Australia this weekend and then travel to Malaysia.

    HKMA tracks Fed's decision and keeps rate steady

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The HKMA says the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757245_2_20240613115320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday left its base rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, tracking a decision by the US Federal Reserve to keep its key lending rate steady.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the benchmark interest rate between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, and said there is likely to be only one cut, of a quarter of a percentage point, this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an online press call, Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said the Fed's decision to keep the rate unchanged was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said there is no rush for the Fed to start cutting rates, as there are indications of resilience in the US economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the Fed's perspective, I think they do want to see inflation completely under control, and they would take a lot more comfort to act when the time comes. So I think at this juncture, the market is kind of expecting the first cut to come in September. That is very much in line with the dot plot that was released last night," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said that with recent economic data showing mixed signs and inflation remaining high, it's uncertain when the Fed will start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets continue to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading local banks, including HSBC, Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Standard Chartered, announced they were keeping their rates unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Sze-kei, Head of Wealth Strategy and Insights Division at Bank of China (Hong Kong), said the Fed's decision to maintain its interest rates was to prevent a sharp rebound in US inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung explained that while inflation in the US had been on a downward trajectory, the local job market and economy displayed strength, demonstrating resilience in inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, Cheung said the Fed had adopted a prudent approach in managing interest rates.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Xinhua commentary says the EU should embrace competition as an impetus for its own development. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757238_1_20240613112719.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry has urged the European Commission to stop turning trade into a political issue and avoid harming mutual trust between China and the European Union, as shares in Chinese automakers ended on a mostly positive note on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The comment from the Foreign Ministry came as the European Commission announced it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported electric cars from China starting in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will take all necessary measures to counter these actions, spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency had earlier said the move by the EU violates the rights and interests of the nation's EV industry and wreaks havoc on the global automotive supply chain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a commentary published late on Wednesday, Xinhua said "the EU's justification for these tariffs are based on claims of unfair competition due to so-called 'distortive' Chinese government subsidies. However, this claim is nothing but a thinly veiled excuse for protectionism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after Washington announced plans to quadruple duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would combat excessive subsidies with additional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes as European automakers are being challenged by an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. Still, there's virtually no support for tariffs from the European auto industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German automakers in particular are heavily dependent on sales in China and fear retribution from Beijing. European auto firms also import their own Chinese-made vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xinhua commentary continued by saying the EU should instead "embrace this competition as an impetus for its own development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that rather than imposing tariffs, the EU should seek collaborative solutions that benefit all parties involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, shares in BYD shot up more than five percent on Thursday on the Hang Seng Index, where carmakers NIO and Geely also ended the day 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent higher. SAIC was down more than 1.5 percent in Shanghai. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    The Green Earth calls for more composting capacity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Founder Edwin Lau quoted current daily composting capacity at being about a fifth of what was required. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757223_1_20240613111509.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of environmental group The Green Earth, Edwin Lau, has welcomed the government's plan to have a food waste recycling bin for each and every public housing block within two years but he says there is still room to expand the composting of waste once it is collected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Lau said government data from 2022 pointed to Hong Kong's daily food waste disposal at being over 3,300 metric tonnes but that current composting capacity was less than 20 percent of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to match both the total amount of food waste collected from the housing estates and also, at the back end, all the facilities or the food waste composting system," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the Organic Resources Recovery Centre at Siu Ho Wan in North Lantau, known as O-Park 1, was currently up and running and that O-Park 2 at Sha Ling in North District was undergoing trial runs before being operational later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two added together will be 500 tonnes of food waste capacity per day. And, besides these two, there are two sewage co-digestion plants operating, that all together total 100 tonnes per day capacity. So you add up all these four facilities and there is a maximum of 600 tonnes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said he thought the government had most likely done the calculation to match the front-end and the back-end to prevent any kind of bottle-neck from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, around 90 percent of public estates share some 700 smart recycling bins, and every estate will have at least one bin by next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment minister Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers on Wednesday that the plan was to match the number of blocks with the same amount of bins within two years. Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year and that more bins would be added to estates where there was strong demand.

    Russian war ships in Cuba on 'routine visit'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Russian navy frigate and a nuclear-powered submarine churned into Havana harbour on Wednesday, a stopover the US and Cuba said posed no threat but was seen as a Russian show of force.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cuba - a long-time ally of Russia - saluted the ships' arrival with cannon fire, while Russian diplomats waved Russian flags and took selfies as the vessels passed the harbour's historic fortresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Admiral Gorshkov frigate, and later the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, half submerged with its crew on deck, were accompanied by a tugboat and fuel ship that had arrived earlier in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four Russian vessels sailed to Cuba after conducting "high-precision missile weapons" training in the Atlantic Ocean, according to Russia's defence ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The submarine and frigate carry Zircon hypersonic missiles, Kalibr cruise missiles and Onyx anti-ship missiles, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cuba said last week that the visit was standard practice by naval vessels from countries friendly to Havana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cuban foreign ministry said the fleet carried no nuclear weapons, something echoed by US officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US said it had been monitoring the Russian vessels as they skirted the nearby Florida coast, but said they posed no threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday such naval exercises were routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen this kind of thing before and we expect to see this kind of thing again, and I'm not going to read into it any particular motives," Sullivan said. (Reuters)

Photo:" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757214_1_20240613095143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Engineering professor and lawmaker William Wong says one of the reasons The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) chose start-up "SmartMore" for its inaugural investment was its plan to base future research in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the financial return, part of it is the promise to create more positions for researchers. The Smart-More company promised to actually establish an research centre, an AI research centre, in Hong Kong and all these things are actually favourable to Hong Kong developing into an international information technology hub," Wong said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government investment vehicle and SmartMore signed a cooperation deal on Wednesday. The company is involved in artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC's CEO Clara Chan has said there will be different investment themes with AI in June, life sciences in July, and new energy technology in August. Professor Wong, who is the associate dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the Chinese University, was also asked for his views on these investment themes and whether they would suit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From this particular case, you can see the government is working very hard step by step... to satisfy the KPIs," he said referring to the investment term 'Key Performance Indicator'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Financial Secretary Paul Chan hailed the partnership between the government-owned investment vehicle and the local tech unicorn, saying it would help boost Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 India qualified for the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket win over the United States on Wednesday, with a fifty by Suryakumar Yadav and Arshdeep Singh's four-wicket haul helping them clinch their third win in a row.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Put in to bat first, the Americans struggled as Arshdeep [4-9] dismissed Shayan Jahangir [0] and Andries Gous [2] in the first over. But Steven Taylor [24] and Nitish Kumar [27] set the stage for a competitive total of 110-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India also struggled at the start, with Saurabh Netravalkar sending openers Virat Kohli [0] and Rohit Sharma [3] back early. But Yadav [50 not out] and Shivam Dube [31 not out] steadied the innings and got India over the line with 10 balls to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The U.S., second in Group A with four points after suffering their first loss in three matches, will also ensure qualification for the next round if they beat Ireland on Friday. (Reuters)

    US Congress holds AG in contempt over Biden tapes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Merrick Garland is the third US attorney-general to be held in contempt of Congress. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757197_1_20240613052411.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over audio recordings of a special counsel interview with Democratic President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure passed 216-207 on a party-line basis with one Republican joining Democrats in voting no.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice has already turned over a transcript of the interview, which set off a political firestorm in February when Special Counsel Robert Hur released a report describing Biden, 81, as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has asserted that the recordings are covered by executive privilege, and a vote by the House to hold Garland in contempt would put the Justice Department in the awkward position of having to decide whether to prosecute its own leader. It is not required to take up the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garland is the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress, following Democratic President Barack Obama's attorney general Eric Holder and Republican President Donald Trump's Bill Barr. The Justice Department did not pursue charges in either case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Transcripts alone are not sufficient evidence of the state of the president's memory," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said as debate opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representative Jerrold Nadler, the senior Democrat on the panel, countered that Republicans were on a "single-minded quest to follow every right-wing conspiracy theory in the vain hope that it might lead to some evidence of wrongdoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hur, who had investigated Biden after classified documents dating to his time as vice president from 2009-2017 were found improperly stored in his home and office, declined to prosecute the president, saying it was both because he had cooperated with the probe and because he would present a sympathetic face to a jury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's rival in the November 5 election, Trump, has been criminally charged for mishandling classified documents after his 2017-2021 term in the White House, though unlike Biden, Trump refused requests to return the documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congressional Democrats have alleged that Republicans want the audio to use in campaign ads for Trump. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closing highs for a third straight day on Wednesday after inflation data came in softer than expected but the indexes ended off the day's highs as the Federal Reserve projected only one interest rate cut this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fed's March projections included three quarter-percentage-point reductions. The US central bank, in a statement at the end of its June 11-12 meeting, also said it left its policy rate unchanged, as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks were choppy following the news and press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq paring gains late and the Dow finishing near flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks opened higher after the Labour Department reported that the US Consumer Price Index was unexpectedly unchanged in May due to cheaper gasoline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The CPI number was certainly cooler than estimates and drove optimism to start the day but that was only half of today's menu," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James said he would have expected the market to end weaker after the Fed's update, noting that "the commentary was hawkish and rate cut (expectations) were trimmed from three to one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oracle shares jumped 13.3 percent, lifting the market, after the software provider forecast double-digit revenue in fiscal 2025 after the bell on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.09 percent, to 38,712. The S&P 500 rose 0.85 percent, to 5,421 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.53 percent, to 17,608.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just after the CPI report, traders boosted bets for a Fed rate cut by September and another by December.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with officials projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for the year amid rising estimates for what it will take to keep inflation in check.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The markdown in the outlook for rate cuts, from three quarter-percentage-point reductions seen in the Fed's March projections, was made despite the central bank's acknowledgement in its new policy statement of "modest further progress" towards its 2 percent inflation target – an upgrade from its May 1 statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It coincided with an increase to 2.8 percent in the estimated long-run, or "neutral," rate of interest, from 2.6 percent, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint in order to finish the battle against rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6 percent versus the 2.4 percent anticipated as of March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation –consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday – but also to steady growth and job creation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) will join a unity government with the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), it said on Wednesday, giving a strong indication of who will govern the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ANC, which lost its majority in a May 29 election but remains the largest party, has been talking to a broad spectrum of political parties to try to set up a government of national unity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final composition of the government has not yet been announced, but the comments by IFP leader Velenkosini Hlabisa gave the most precise picture of how negotiations are shaping up ahead of the newly elected parliament's first sitting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many ANC supporters strongly oppose a coalition with the pro-business DA, which is the largest opposition party but has struggled to shed its image as a defender of white privilege.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have speculated that including the IFP, a conservative party with an ethnic Zulu base, could help temper those concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will participate in the government of national unity for the sake of our country and for the sake of our people, who want life to continue with a stable government that will address their challenges," Hlabisa told reporters at a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokespersons for the ANC and the DA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties have been rushing to reach agreement before Friday, when the National Assembly will meet to elect its speaker, deputy speaker and the country's president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Cyril Ramaphosa is highly likely to be reelected since the ANC has the highest number of seats, but key positions such as speaker of parliament and deputy president are the subject of behind-the-scenes negotiations. (Reuters)

    Macron urges centre to unite; Republicans ditch leader

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Emmanuel Macron speaks at a media briefing. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757182_1_20240613004537.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday urged rival parties to join his electoral alliance against Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, while the conservative Republicans ditched their party chief for seeking a far-right pact.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fast-moving political developments come after Macron's shock decision to call a snap parliamentary election in a few weeks' time. The vote could hand real power to Le Pen's party after years on the sidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what amounted to a campaign speech, Macron on Wednesday defended his decision to call the snap vote, and urged parties on both sides of the political centre to join him in the battle against the hard right in the June 30 and July 7 elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, who ruled out quitting if his ruling alliance loses, called on "our compatriots and political leaders who do not recognise themselves in the extremist fever" to "build a new project ... a coalition to govern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of the political chaos that Macron's decision has unleashed, the Republicans party leadership on Wednesday decided to kick out their party chief Eric Ciotti after he appealed for an electoral alliance between his party's candidates and the RN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron described such an accord as a "deal with the devil". It would have ended the decades-long mainstream political consensus to block the far-right from power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on X, Ciotti said the Republicans meeting had not followed protocol: "I am and remain the president of our political party, elected by the members!" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron called the election on Sunday after the anti-immigration, eurosceptic RN came out on top in a vote for the European Parliament. (Reuters)

 Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry West, a star guard from the 1960s for the Los Angeles Lakers whose profile on the court inspired the design of the NBA logo, died on Wednesday aged 86.
 <br>
  <br/>
  West played for the Lakers from 1960 until 1974, winning his only NBA title as a player in 1972 while being named as an All-Star for all 14 seasons in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won eight NBA titles as an executive – six with the Lakers and twice with the Golden State Warriors in the Stephen Curry era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After leaving the Warriors in 2017, he joined the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive, which announced his passing. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The former head coach of the SAR football team, Jørn Andersen, was on Wednesday confirmed as the new manager of second-tier mainland side Yunnan Yukun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian, 61, quit the Hong Kong, China squad late last month, saying he'd received an offer he "couldn't refuse".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had taken the SAR to its first AFC Cup in more than 50 years, as well as leading the under-23 squad to its first-ever semifinals at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an announcement on social media, Yunnan Yukun described Andersen as an experienced coach with strong leadership skills, saying he can lead the team to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland club are currently leading the second tier of Chinese football, with nine wins from 13 matches for 30 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its former head coach, Li Jinyu, resigned last month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parts of Wong Tai Sin plunged into darkness for four hours on Wednesday evening, with CLP saying a faulty cable was to blame for cutting off power to more than 2,200 customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos on social media showed a number of residential buildings and shopping malls were affected by the blackout at around 8pm. Power was eventually restored shortly after midnight. Temple Mall North, Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate and Mei Tung Estate were among the areas affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said it was very concerned about the outage. "Residents were trapped in lifts and might have an uncomfortable night under this hot weather," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency shelters were set up at Tung Tau Community Centre and Wong Tai Sin Community Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Fire Services Department, there were at least four reports of people trapped in lifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power outage was caused by a malfunction in an 11,000-volt cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm apologised to those affected, adding that urgent repair work was being carried out, with emergency generators taken to the site.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that broke out in a building housing workers in the city of Mangaf in southern Kuwait early on Wednesday has killed at least 41 people, the country's deputy prime minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Saud Al-Sabah said during a visit to the site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deputy PM accused real estate owners of violations and greed, saying those factors contributed towards the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, the greed of real estate owners is what leads to these matters," said Sheikh Fahad, who also runs the interior and defense ministries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was reported to authorities at 6am local time, Major General Eid Rashed Hamad said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The building in which the fire occurred was used to house workers, and there was a large number of workers there. Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire," another senior police commander told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always alert and warn against" cramming too many workers into housing accommodation, he said, without providing details on the workers' type of employment or place of origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was contained and authorities were investigating its cause, officials said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimming star Ariarne Titmus shattered her fellow Australian Mollie O'Callaghan's world record in the women's 200 metres freestyle, clocking one minute, 52.23 seconds just weeks before the defence of her title at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall at Australia's Olympic trials in Brisbane ahead of O'Callaghan, who also went under her previous world record of 1:52.85, finishing in 1:52.48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at the results, it's unbelievable. I'm really happy to finally produce a swim in the 200 that I feel like my training reflects," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Aussie pair will provide Hong Kong's Siobhán Haughey with stiff competition in the race for 200 metres glory in Paris, with O'Callaghan also expected to duel against Haughey in the women's 100 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus has been in top form in Brisbane, swimming the second-fastest 400 metres freestyle of all time on Monday as she also prepares to defend that Olympic title against the likes of Canadian Summer McIntosh and American star Katie Ledecky. (AFP)

    Show of force necessary for absconders: Regina Ip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Regina Ip backed the government's move to impose sanctions against six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences, saying it was necessary to demonstrate to the public that there are consequences for breaking the law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I doubt very much whether these absconders will actually come back to Hong Kong to face the law," the former security minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it will demonstrate to any potential absconders that the government takes absconding highly seriously, and there are punitive measures directed against them if they do run away from the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another former security chief-turned-lawmaker, Lai Tung-kwok, said the purpose of revoking the fugitives' passports was to limit their mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted they could still visit countries using other travel documents, such as a British National (Overseas) passport which is not recognised in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong warned that anyone who joins paid subscriptions of websites or channels run by the six persons may be seen as providing financial aid to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said people may still fall foul of the law by simply "following" such pages, as this may indirectly help the wanted persons generate revenue through advertisements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday criticised additional European Union tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), saying the move violated market economy principles and international trade rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  MOFA spokesperson Lin Jian said any additional tariffs on Chinese EVs would eventually undermine the EU's own interests, adding Beijing would take all necessary measures to protect its lawful rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's comments came ahead of an announcement by the European Commission that it would apply additional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after the United States quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would set tariffs of 17.4 percent for BYD, 20 percent for Geely and 38.1 percent for SAIC over what it said were excessive subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU provisional duties are set to apply by July 4, with an anti-subsidy investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could apply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission vice president, told a news conference that Chinese-built cars were benefiting from unfair levels of subsidies, threatening EU producers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this basis the Commission has reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss these findings and explore possible ways for resolving the issues identified," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China is strongly dissatisfied with the European plan to impose provisional duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, saying the move ignored facts and World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said Beijing will resolutely take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese companies. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Wednesday said a government taskforce set up to look into a  public spat involving top management at the University of Hong Kong will help with internal communication, rather than investigating specific incidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang and the head of the university's governing council, Priscilla Wong, have been in conflict over senior appointments and management issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday announced the formation of the taskforce, comprising of Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li and head of the University Grants Council Tim Lui. It said their role will include coordinating cooperation and communication within HKU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the pair will contact or meet people involved in the matter, to find out more about the issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group doesn't have a timetable...we hope to gradually show results to the public in the process," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aim is not just to come up with a written report on the matter, we want to play an actual role."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said a tie-up between a government-owned investment vehicle and a local tech unicorn will add momentum to Hong Kong's securities market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Corporation has signed a cooperation deal with SmartMore, a technology company specialising in artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Hong Kong Corporation and SmartMore is a good starting point for advancing Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry towards a brighter future," Chan said in a speech at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the upcoming months, the Hong Kong Investment Corporation will continue to announce more strategic partnerships and actively pursue direct investments and joint investment projects. These projects will encompass various fields, including life sciences, green technology, and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said Hong Kong spent HK$30.1 billion on research and development in 2022, up from HK$21.3 billion in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that there were 4,250 tech startups in Hong Kong last year.

    'Food waste bins to feature at all public housing'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="About 700 smart recycling bins for food waste have been installed at about 90 percent of public housing estates across the territory. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757097_1_20240612152524.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he expects each public housing block to have a food waste recycling bin within two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers at a Legco meeting, he said about 700 smart recycling bins for food waste were installed at about 90 percent of public estates across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the smart recycling bins would be installed at all public estates in Hong Kong by next month, which was a month ahead of the original schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added more bins would be installed at public estates, with the goal of installing a bin at each public housing block within two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmakers questioned if the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some old residents told me that there are 11 blocks in their estate, with 380 units, but there are only three food waste smart recycling bins in the whole estate... Can we expedite the process and have one bin in each block within one year?" lawmaker Kitson Yang asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said discussions would be made with the Housing Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see which residential buildings have higher usage of food waste smart recycling bins, and we will install more bins at those estates with higher usage. We will also replace the inner bins of the recycling bins more often to enhance its capacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An insider trading case against Asian hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its British founder Simon Sadler and a former trader has been moved to the District Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Eastern Magistrates' Court approved the prosecution’s request to transfer the case to a higher court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next hearing is scheduled to take place at the District Court on July 2, the court ruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum prison term a district court judge can impose is seven years, versus two to three years for the magistrate's court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case marks a turning point for one of Asia's biggest and oldest hedge funds as well as a step toward heightened scrutiny of trading activities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said last month it had started criminal proceedings against Segantii, its founder and chief investment officer Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca on suspicion of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company before a block trade in June 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accusation relates to insider information about Hong Kong-listed fashion chain Esprit Holdings, the court readout revealed, adding Segantii received the information from Tony Psarianos, a person connected to Esprit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psarianos was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch from 2007 to 2021, according to SFC licence records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, dubbed Asia's "block trade king", is also the owner of his home-town soccer team, Blackpool Football Club. (Reuters)

    Woman loses final appeal over Quarry Bay shootings

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's top court has dismissed an appeal by a woman who was jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle and wounding two other relatives. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757064_1_20240612115331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle lost her final appeal against her convictions for murder on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former bodyguard Tsim Sum-kit also shot and wounded two other relatives in the attack in Quarry Bay Park in 2018, following a family lunch to discuss dividing up the estate of her late grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a High Court trial in 2021, the defence failed to the convince the jury that Tsim had suffered from an abnormality of the mind which resulted in an impairment of mental responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her latest appeal, Tsim argued that the legal requirement for a defendant to prove they suffer from diminished responsibility – if this is to be used as a partial defence to murder – infringes upon the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a written judgement, a panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges said the question of diminished responsibility does not affect the presumption of innocence as it is not an ingredient of the offence a defendant is charged with, but an extenuating mitigating circumstance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said diminished responsibility is a factor that only comes into play if and when prosecutors have proven a defendant's guilt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The partial defence of diminished responsibility does not in any way reduce the burden on the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence of murder," the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is only when a defendant is prima facie guilty of murder that the plea of diminished responsibility becomes relevant. If the prosecution has not already discharged the onus of proving the actus reus and mens rea of murder, the defendant will be entitled to an outright acquittal on the charge of murder and the plea of diminished responsibility will have no further relevance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsim had also asked the court to consider whether the requirement under the Homicide Ordinance for the defence to prove diminished responsibility is proportionate and justified, or whether offering some evidence to support the claim ought to be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this point, the judges said the ordinance has "the legitimate aim of alleviating the prosecution from an unworkable burden arising from the practical difficulties of proving a matter so personal to the accused".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that a number of factors support this conclusion, including "the fact mental disorders and their effects are not part of ordinary life experience of a jury [and] the fact an accused cannot be compelled to be subject to medical examination by the prosecution."

    CUHK unveils novel bladder cancer surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dr Jeremy Teoh (seated) says the new surgery technique can remove the whole tumour in one piece rather than fragmenting it, reducing the chance of the cancer returning. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757084_1_20240612145650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese University’s Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it had identified a new surgery technique that was better at preventing bladder cancer from recurring in patients compared with traditional procedures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three hundred and fifty bladder cancer patients participated in the clinical trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of them underwent a new surgery technique called en bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) and the other half underwent traditional procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Jeremy Teoh, who led the research, noted that the one-year cancer recurrence rate for patients who had received traditional surgery was between 30 and 40 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, Teoh said the recurrence rate in those who had received ERBT dropped to about 28 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Essentially during the [new] surgery, we try to preserve the whole tumour, try not to touch it, avoid fragmentation of the tumour, and also the whole specimen can be retrieved in one piece to ensure a complete resection by histology,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is currently available at 13 hospitals in Hong Kong, including Prince of Wales Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teoh said all bladder cancer patients with a tumour size of less than three centimetres could consult with their doctors about having the new surgery.

    'Retailers must maintain their competitiveness'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Wednesday urged the retail sector to enhance its efforts in maintaining its competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at the Hong Kong Retail Summit, organised by the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Yau said economic activity in the city had returned to normal and tourist numbers were growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau said the retail sector still faced various challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must also confront the various new challenges facing the retail industry, as the preferences and behaviour patterns of tourists - and Hongkongers - are changing," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Retailers must keep pace with these changes, continuously innovate, and adjust their operational strategies in order to maintain their competitiveness and advantage in an ever-changing market environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the summit, the chairwoman of the city’s retail management association, Annie Yau-Tse, said the retail performance in both the tourist and local markets had been disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We [have been seeing] the trend of [budget travel] since last year. That's why we see that the tourists are actually focusing on enjoying their time in Hong Kong, like taking photos, but not really buying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This trend is actually really affecting our industry, because in the past we have been making a lot of business out of the tourists who are actually coming for shopping. But nowadays, you don't really see too many people carrying their suitcases for shopping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau-Tse said retailers in Hong Kong should leverage technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to understand consumer patterns better and create tailored promotion plans to adapt to the changing market dynamics.
