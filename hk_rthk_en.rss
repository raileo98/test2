<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say the government will shelve its plan to introduce a citywide waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The arrangement was originally scheduled to come into effect from August 1, but sources say the government will inform the Legislative Council on Monday of its plan to put it on the back-burner indefinitely.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who's also chairman of Legco's Panel on Environmental Affairs, welcomed the news, saying this is not the right time to introduce the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said officials should consider a number of factors, such as the state of the city's economy and the availability of recycling services, before deciding when to bring back the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lau added that he believes the government will continue to step up education and promotional efforts on waste reduction to boost the community’s understanding of the matter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a trilateral summit with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. It's their first three-way talks in more than four years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries agreed to hold a summit every year starting in 2008 to boost regional cooperation, but the initiative has been disrupted by tensions and the Covid-19 pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Their last trilateral summit was in late 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials in Seoul said South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Li will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the ageing population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with Li and Kishida ahead of their three-way gathering on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kishida is also expected to meet separately with Li.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials and diplomats in Seoul warned not to expect breakthroughs on sensitive issues but said the summit could make progress in areas of practical cooperation like people-to-people exchanges and consular matters. (Reuters)

    Trump vows to free 'dark web' drug kingpin

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of US presidential candidate Donald Trump spar with opponents during the Libertarian Party's national convention in Washington. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754743_1_20240526140121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump appealed for support from the fringe Libertarian Party on Saturday, telling a rowdy crowd that if elected he would free from prison an American man who ran a website that sold millions of dollars in drugs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The announcement came at a contentious speech -- where the crowd often jeered and booed the ex-president -- at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, as he seeks support in the November US election against incumbent Joe Biden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If you vote for me, on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht," Trump said, in a line that brought the rowdy crowd over to his side as cheers erupted from the audience.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also vowed to put a libertarian in his cabinet.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2015, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of masterminding the Silk Road "dark web" marketplace, which sold US$200 million in drugs to customers across the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ulbricht, who ran Silk Road under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" and was also accused of commissioning five murders at a cost of US$650,000, was sentenced to two life sentences for narcotics distribution and criminal enterprise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His case has become a famous cause in libertarian circles, who have decried the conviction as government overreach and against the principles of free markets.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump has previously vowed to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While the promise to free Ulbricht brought cheers, Trump's speech was far from the usual lovefest he presides over at his rallies, which typically attract hardcore supporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The conservative was variously booed as he tried to make common cause with the libertarians in the audience, many of whom view his policies as outside their extremely limited scope of what the government should be able to do.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Libertarian Party should nominate Trump for president of the United States," he said to a mix of cheers and boos.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Only if you want to win. Maybe you don't want to win," Trump said as he at times sparred with the audience.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The speech came after Trump rolled the dice on Thursday by making a campaign stop in deeply Democratic New York, seeking to woo Black and Latino voters whose support for Biden has shown signs of faltering.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If you want to compete for untraditional votes, you have to take risks," Trump advisor Jason Miller told news outlet Semafor.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Libertarian Party routinely runs minor candidates that promote both popular limited-government ideas like marijuana legalization while simultaneously pushing fringe ideas like abolishing the federal tax collection agency or social security.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its candidates have never posed serious threats in presidential elections.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If they weren't interested in mixing it up by endorsing Trump, they were free to "keep getting your three percent every four years," he said. (AFP)

    Golf world rocked by death of Grayson Murray

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfer Grayson Murray, who won his second PGA TOUR title at the Sony Open in January, died on Saturday at the age of 30, the tour said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray had withdrawn from the Charles Schwab Challenge with an unspecified illness during Friday's second round in Texas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We were devastated to learn - and are heartbroken to share - that PGA Tour player Grayson Murray passed away this morning. I am at a loss for words," PGA TOUR Commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The PGA Tour is a family, and when you lose a member of your family, you are never the same. We mourn Grayson and pray for comfort for his loved ones."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monahan said he had spoken with Murray's parents to offer condolences and they had "asked that we continue with tournament play.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They were adamant that Grayson would want us to do so. As difficult as it will be, we want to respect their wishes."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Tour did not specify a cause of death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray's second career title in Hawaii in January was an emotional affair, capping a stunning personal comeback from alcohol abuse and mental health issues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray, who had claimed his only prior tour title as a rookie at the 2017 Barbasol Championship, had also been slowed by a motor scooter accident in Bermuda in 2022.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After rolling in a 38-foot birdie putt to win a three-man playoff, Murray said he hoped his return to the winner's circle could provide inspiration for others.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If I can help one person that's all it takes," he said in Hawaii.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's not easy," Murray mused.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I wanted to give up a lot of times -- give up on myself, give up on the game of golf, give up on life at times," he said, adding that he hoped his legacy going forward would be to be "known as a good person."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Murray had been tabbed for stardom from a young age.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was just 16 when he made his first cut on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour and won three straight Junior World Championships from 2006-08.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A solid season on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2023 saw him return to the PGA Tour, and his Sony Open victory saw him reach a career high 46th in the world rankings. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico City, which is in the midst of a heatwave, recorded its highest-ever temperature on Saturday as thermostats hit 34.7 degrees Celsius, according to the National Meteorological Service (SMN).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The record high was recorded on Saturday afternoon at the Tacubaya observatory, the SMN said, after thermometers in the capital reached an earlier record of 34.3 degrees Celsius on May 9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico warned on Wednesday that in the next two weeks intensifying heat could bring new record temperatures to the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The country has recorded 48 deaths due to intense heatwaves hitting the country since March, the government said on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The eastern coastal state of Veracruz recorded the highest number of deaths, with 14, followed by Tabasco, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas with eight each.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, Mexico reported a record 419 heat-related deaths in the hot season, which runs from March to October, in a country of 129 million people. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of a community project to support carers on Sunday said nine carer spaces will be set up across the city to identify caregivers and address their plight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Patrick Nip, convenor of the the Advisory Committee of the Jockey Club Carer Space Project, said Hong Kong’s ageing population is a growing cause for concern.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nip noted that some 240,000 people are providing long-term care for around 300,000 elderly citizens in the community.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a radio programme, Nip said it's important to remind carers to take care of their own mental health.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "How can we strengthen support for carers and remind them that they have their own needs too? Some don't see themselves as carers because they think it's their duty. Others might not be aware of their own mental state - even when they're on the verge of collapse. So I think an assessment is needed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The carer spaces, located in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Ma On Shan, Kwai Fong, Tsing Yi, Tai Wai, Shek Kip Mei, Sai Wan Ho and Sham Shui Po, will provide counselling and assessment services for carers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daytime respite services for the elderly will also be available at a cost of HK$30 for four hours, with exemptions for those facing financial difficulties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nip, a former government official, said the five-year project is expected to benefit around 27,000 carers and 15,000 care recipients.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the ultimate goal is to create a viable model for the administration to consider going forward.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Most importantly, we hope to innovate boldly and try to find a feasible model in this pilot project. It can be replicated on a large scale, so the government can take over and it can be sustained. This is our goal," he explained.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said talks he held during his trip to Paris showed that these visits were conducive to helping others better understand the SAR's development, and clearing up misunderstandings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing on his official blog, the minister said he had been promoting the SAR's advantages to political and business leaders in France, and they were highly interested in the city’s latest developments.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some meeting participants told us that it was very important for the SAR government to actively go out and contact friends from different sectors," he wrote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The financial chief said people he met during his French visit agreed that the SAR remains highly promising, with some describing the city as being as vibrant and charismatic as it was before the pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan added that he had been fostering exchanges between the two places in the business and cultural arenas, noting that he invited the organiser of a French tech conference, VivaTech, as well as the Théâtre National de Chaillot, to come to Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said he will be leaving for San Francisco on Monday to promote cooperation between China and the United States in dealing with climate change.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Although the current geopolitical situation is complicated, addressing climate change is the responsibility of the whole world. Countries must establish a stronger foundation for cooperation and smoother communication channels, so that the world can have a greater chance of success in moving towards zero carbon."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan said Hong Kong is sparing no efforts in becoming an international hub of green technology and finance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He noted that he and other representatives will be sharing the SAR's knowledge and experience in developing a sustainable future in the Bay to Bay Dialogue and the US-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action.

 Police on Sunday appealed to witnesses to a fatal traffic accident overnight to come forward.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They said a 22-year-old motorcyclist and his 24-year-old female pillion passenger were travelling along Argyle Street towards Nathan Road just before 3am.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They said the motorcyclist collided with a taxi driven by a 27-year-old man when it was approaching the junction of Argyle Street and Nathan Road.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The motorcyclist and his passenger sustained serious multiple injuries and were taken to Kwong Wah Hospital, where they were certified dead just before four o'clock, police said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The taxi driver and a 38-year old passenger suffered injuries to their limbs, and were also taken to Kwong Wah Hospital. An elderly male pedestrian was hit by fragments from the collision.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Nicki Minaj was detained at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on suspicion of possessing soft drugs before being released with a fine, Dutch media reported on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The singer was due to perform a show in Britain later on Saturday and posted images on social media of her being questioned by officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police confirmed that they had detained a 41-year-old American woman but declined to confirm directly that it was Minaj, as per their usual policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We never confirm the identity of a person in custody but I can confirm we have arrested a 41-year-old woman suspected of trying to export soft drugs to another country," said Robert Kapel, a military police spokesman.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kapel later said the suspect had been released after the payment of a "reasonable" fine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's no reason for us to keep her in custody any longer. We have all the information for our file. Case closed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The rapper posted on X that authorities told her they had found cannabis in her luggage, which she said belonged to her security personnel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Keep in mind they took my bags without consent. My security has already advised them those pre-rolls belong to him," she wrote on X, referring to marijuana joints.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Now they said I have to go five mins away to make a statement about my security to the police precinct," she said. "It's to try to make me late so that they can write negative stories."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her concert in Manchester scheduled for Saturday night had to be postponed. Promoter Live Nation said the performance will be rescheduled and tickets will be honoured.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A common misconception outside the Netherlands is that dope is legal in the country, home to world-famous coffee shops (which actually sell pot) that are a huge draw for cannabis smokers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The consumption of small quantities of cannabis is technically illegal but police choose not to enforce the law as part of a "tolerance" policy in place since the 1970s.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Transporting the drugs to another country is illegal. (AFP/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Adam Idah scored a 90th-minute winner as Celtic beat Glasgow rivals Rangers 1-0 on Saturday to lift the Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A scrappy game was decided by an error as Jack Butland fumbled Paulo Bernardo's effort and Idah pounced for his ninth goal of a loan spell from Norwich.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I said I'd come here to try and score as many goals as I could, I didn't think I'd score a goal like this in front of all these fans. It's an amazing feeling," said Idah, who only made the move to Glasgow in January.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's hard to put into words. Anyone here can see what it means to the fans, to the players. I've always supported Celtic, it's amazing!"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rangers thought they had taken the lead earlier in the second half when Abdallah Sima turned home a corner at the far post.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But after a VAR review, Celtic goalkeeper Joe Hart was handed a reprieve in the final match of his career as the former England international had been pushed by Nico Raskin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Celtic were far from their best but maintained their unbeaten record in five meetings against Rangers this season, which has also secured them direct qualification for next season's Champions League by winning the Scottish Premiership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Victory also continued Brendan Rodgers' remarkable Scottish Cup record across two spells in charge of the Hoops.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rodgers has never lost a Scottish Cup tie in 17 matches and takes his trophy haul as a Celtic boss to nine in three-and-a-half seasons.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Celtic's win also has historical significance as they move level with Rangers' total of 118 trophies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The head-to-head between the clubs is also now level after 441 meetings with 169 wins each and 103 draws. (AFP)

    Russian strikes on Kharkiv DIY store kill 4 people

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Saturday bombed a hardware superstore in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, killing at least four people and wounding 38, Ukraine officials said, in an attack condemned as "vile" by President Volodymyr Zelensky.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov said "unfortunately there are already four dead" and "38 wounded" after two guided Russian bombs hit the store.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Two of those killed "were men who worked in the hypermarket," Synegubov said earlier in a video posted on Telegram.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Thick black smoke billowed from the gutted building of the Epitsentr DIY superstore in the northeastern outskirts of the city, as firefighters sprayed water on a blaze sparked by the strikes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Still wearing her uniform, Lyubov, a cleaner at the hypermarket told how she escaped the building.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It happened all of a sudden. We didn't understand at first, everything went dark and everything started falling on our heads," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It was good that my phone lit up, thanks to the flashlight I found where to go, but in front of us everything was burning already."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Epitsentr chain sells household and DIY goods.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As of now, we know that more than 200 people could have been inside the hypermarket," Zelensky said on Telegram, condemning the daylight attack on an "obviously civilian" target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia's TASS state news agency cited a security source as claiming that a missile strike destroyed a "military store and command post" inside the shopping centre.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The regional governor said there was "no contact with some of the staff" and "according to our information, visitors could still be in the building."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just a few dozen kilometres from the border and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles. (AFP)

    Barca avenge Lyon defeats to win third Women's CL

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bonmati celebrates after her deflected shot gives Barca the lead. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754706_1_20240526032142.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas struck to earn Barcelona their third women's Champions League trophy, securing a 2-0 triumph over record eight-time winners Lyon on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The defending champions had never beaten the French giants, losing in the 2019 and 2022 finals against them, but finally succeeded in Bilbao to compete a spectacular quadruple this season in coach Jonatan Giraldez's last match in charge.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bonmati pounced after 63 minutes and substitute Putellas finished the job in stoppage time to avenge Barcelona's prior defeats by Sonia Bompastor's side.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Securing their third Champions League trophy from five final appearances across the last six seasons, Barcelona demonstrated that they are the new powerhouse of the women's game.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Barca stars insisted this time they were capable of beating Lyon, adding experience and mental strength to their undoubted talent, and so it proved at a packed San Mames.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Backed by the vast majority of a 51,000 record crowd at a women's Champions League final, Bonmati and her side completed one of the few outstanding challenges remaining to them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Giraldez started Mariona Caldentey in attack and moved Fridolina Rolfo to left-back, dropping Ona Batlle to the bench alongside two-time Ballon d'Or winner Putellas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lyon left Ada Hegerberg on the bench too, with the all-time top scorer in the competition's history struggling for form after injury.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lucy Bronze deflected a ball onto her own crossbar and Lyon's towering captain Wendie Renard hit the outside of the post as Barcelona suffered a couple of early jitters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After going four goals down by half-time in the 2019 final and three down in 2022, this time the Catalans dug deep to hold it together at the back.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They threatened increasingly at the other end. Patri Guijarro, who scored twice in last year's final against Wolfsburg, broke in behind for their first big chance after half an hour.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Christiane Endler saved her effort from an angle and Selma Bacha cleared the ball off the line after it rebounded back towards goal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Caroline Graham Hansen, in sparkling form this season, gave left-back Bacha a torrid time and had 11-time finalist Renard uncertainly backpedalling fearfully near the end of the first half, but dragged her shot wide.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Barcelona made their quality count in the 63rd minute when Bonmati sent them ahead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Ballon d'Or winner had been quiet but arrived just at the right time to collect Caldentey's clever pass and burst into the area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bonmati's low shot deflected off Vanessa Gilles and flew over the helpless Endler, for her sixth goal of the tournament and the most crucial.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Champions League top goalscorer Kadidiatou Diani curled agonisingly over for Lyon as Bompastor's side tried to fight back. Hegerberg headed over as Lyon's chances ebbed away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Eventually Putellas, on as a late substitute, settled the game by rifling into the top corner late on to get Barcelona's celebrations started early. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Al-Ain thrashed 10-man Yokohama F Marinos 5-1 in the second leg of the Asian Champions League final on Saturday to lift the continental title for the first time in 21 years with a 6-3 aggregate win over the Japanese side.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The United Arab Emirates team overturned a 2-1 first-leg deficit, with Soufiane Rahimi and Kodjo Laba both scoring twice and Kaku also on target against a Marinos team for whom Yan Matheus scored and goalkeeper William Popp was sent off.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Al-Ain, who last won the title in 2003, levelled the aggregate score in the eighth minute, Rahimi slotting home after latching onto Yahia Nader's clever back heel and, by the 33rd minute, the home side had taken the lead in the tie.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rahimi was involved again, the Moroccan brought down by Shinnosuke Hatanaka to allow Paraguayan playmaker Kaku to step up and score from the penalty spot.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seven minutes later, however, Marinos struck when Khalid Eisa was unable to do enough to palm Matheus' low shot to safety and the aggregate score was level again.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marinos's task became more complicated deep into first half injury time when Popp was sent off for bringing down Rahimi as the Moroccan raced towards goal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rahimi then hit Al-Ain's crucial third in the 67th minute as he capitalised on the inability of the Marinos defence to clear, beating substitute goalkeeper Fuma Shirasaka with a left-foot shot inside his near post.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Substitute Laba struck twice after his late introduction – in the 91st and 95th minutes – following more poor defending to put the seal on a remarkable win. (Reuters)

    At least 24 dead, mostly children, in India fire

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 24 people were killed, most of them children, when a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in India on Saturday, officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Footage posted on social media showed a ferocious blaze engulfing a temporary structure, with black smoke pouring into the sky.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prabhav Joshi, the district collector of Rajkot, in the western state of Gujarat, said that 24 people had died in the inferno, "mostly children," and another half-dozen were hospitalised.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The police have detained four persons associated with the game zone for questioning," he said. "We are trying to get more details about the owners of the facility."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 300 people were in the two-storey structure at the TRP amusement and theme park when the blaze broke out as it was a summer holiday weekend, Rajkot fire officer Ilesh Kher told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "People got trapped as a temporary structure at the facility collapsed near the entrance, making it difficult for the people to come out," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The flames spread rapidly because of its flammable material, he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Pictures from the scene showed a corrugated metal structure largely in ruins.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gujarat is the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who posted on X: "Extremely distressed by the fire mishap in Rajkot. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. Prayers for the injured."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It took nearly an hour to douse the fire, with about a dozen ambulances carrying the injured to hospital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fire department officials said a short-circuit was suspected as the cause and police at the site said the bodies of the dead were heavily burned, making identification difficult.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Pictures from an Instagram account that appears to belong to the facility show a lively gaming and recreational centre, with teenagers enjoying activities such as bowling, go-karting and trampolining. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="United manager Erik ten Hag hopes winning the FA Cup will save him from the sack. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754698_1_20240526005259.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erik ten Hag made a convincing case to be spared the sack as Manchester United upset Manchester City to take the FA Cup with a shock 2-1 victory in Saturday's final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag was reportedly set to be dismissed regardless of the result at Wembley after a troubled campaign that even the United manager described as "terrible" this week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But United's hierarchy might be having second thoughts after Ten Hag's tactical masterclass ruined City's history bid.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City were hot favourites to win a second successive Premier League and FA Cup double.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yet Ten Hag found a way to neutralise Pep Guardiola's side as first half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo put United on course to win the FA Cup for the first time in eight years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jeremy Doku squeezed an 87th minute strike past Andre Onana's weak attempted save but it was too late to rescue City.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Having ended a turbulent season on a high note, if Ten Hag's two-year reign does end, his exit would provoke memories of fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal's Old Trafford departure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Van Gaal was fired just two days after United's FA Cup final victory against Crystal Palace in 2016.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag will hope a more apt comparison is Alex Ferguson's 1990 FA Cup final win against Palace, which kick-started his remarkable run after calls for his sacking earlier that season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ferguson was in attendance as a match labelled Ten Hag's funeral turned into a triumph for the much-maligned Dutchman.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United shareholder Jim Ratcliffe, who has control of football operations at Old Trafford, was also watching from the stands alongside co-owners Joel and Avie Glazer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Linked with Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Gareth Southgate, among others, there is still plenty for Ratcliffe to ponder after United finished eighth in the Premier League this season – their lowest final position since 1990 – and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag believes a lengthy injury list was the root of the problems and can point to the two trophies he has won in three cup final appearances with United as proof of what he can do when his team are at full strength.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ten Hag ended United's six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last year and has now avenged their 2-1 loss to City in the FA Cup final 12 months ago despite finishing 31 points behind the champions this term.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 United will also qualify for the Europa League, avoiding a first season without European action since 2014-15.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They benefitted from an unusually tepid City performance as their double bid fell flat in their first domestic defeat since losing at Aston Villa in the league 171 days ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last weekend, City became the first team to win the Premier League in four consecutive seasons.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Guardiola's men looked hungover after the celebrations that followed their sixth title in seven years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City were furious when their strong penalty appeal was rejected inside the first minute after Lisandro Martinez's shove sent Erling Haaland sprawling.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Content to sit deep with all 11 men behind the ball, United stifled City impressively and gleefully accepted their gift-wrapped opener in the 30th minute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Diogo Dalot's punt forward should have been dealt with by Josko Gvardiol, but the left-back hesitated as he looked for an offside flag.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gvardiol headed the ball over City keeper Stefan Ortega, who had rashly rushed off his line, leaving Garnacho with the simple task of tapping into the empty net as Ten Hag clenched his fist in celebration.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Garnacho, 19, was the first teenager to score in the FA Cup final since Cristiano Ronaldo for United against Millwall 20 years ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Just nine minutes later, the 19-year-old Mainoo punished more sloppy City defending.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Garnacho advanced unchecked down the right wing and found Fernandes, whose superb first-time pass reached the unmarked Mainoo for a clinical close-range finish.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 City pushed harder after the interval but although Doku's shot slipped through Onana's grasp to set up a tense finale, it wasn't enough to deny United.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As the final seconds ticked away, Ten Hag stood in the sunshine nervously waiting to celebrate a dramatic win that could earn an unexpected stay of execution or serve as his final fling. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tiny NASA satellite was launched on Saturday from New Zealand with the mission of improving climate change prediction by measuring heat escaping from Earth's poles for the first time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This new information – and we've never had it before – will improve our ability to model what's happening in the poles, what's happening in climate," Nasa's earth sciences research director Karen St Germain told a recent news conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The satellite, which is the size of a shoe box, was launched by an Electron rocket, built by a company called Rocket Lab, which lifted off from Mahia in the north of New Zealand. The overall mission is called Prefire.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company is later to launch a similar satellite of its own.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They will serve to take infrared measurements far above the Arctic and Antarctic so as to measure directly the heat that the poles release into space.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is critical because it actually helps to balance the excess heat that's received in the tropical regions and really regulate the earth's temperature," said Tristan L'Ecuyer, a mission researcher affiliated with the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "And the process of getting the heat from the tropical regions to the polar regions is actually what drives all of our weather around the planet," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With Prefire, Nasa aims to understand how clouds, humidity or the melting of ice into water affects this heat loss from the poles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Until now the models that climate change scientists used to gauge heat loss were based on theories rather than real observations, said L'Ecuyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hopefully we'll be able to improve our ability to simulate what sea level rise might look like in the future and also how the polar climate change is going to affect the weather systems around the planet," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Small satellites like this one are a low-cost way to answer very specific scientific questions, said St Germain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Larger satellites can be thought of as "generalists" and the small ones as "specialists," she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "NASA needs both," said St Germain. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of the time-travelling robot cat Doraemon on Saturday got a sneak preview of a forthcoming exhibition, as crowds gathered along Victoria Harbour for the world's first-ever drone show devoted to the beloved Japanese animated character.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The display lasted for more than 10 minutes with large crowds filling the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some people that RTHK spoke to said that the drone show was exciting, while others thought it was a little too short.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Saurabh Agarwal said he really enjoyed the accompanying sound and picture performance with his friends.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It was fantastic. We waited for more than an hour, and it was worth the wait. We actually missed the last show for drones," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This time we just came early to get a good place. This was fantastic and it was the first time I see drones in Hong Kong so I was very excited."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I really enjoyed it. It was brilliant. The drones performed brilliantly. I don't know anything about the cartoon character, but I really enjoyed the show," said Debra Gergson, who is visiting Hong Kong on vacation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Puneet Brar said she wished the show could have been longer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We really enjoyed the show and the graphics. It was an amazing production. I wish it was a little longer because I was enjoying myself a lot," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I thought it was really special and unique. You just can't see a drone show everyday."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier in the morning, visitors got to see dozens of huge models from the series at Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park in Sai Ying Pun.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A woman, surnamed Chan, was among those who went to see the Doraemon figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is so cute. The character is part of the childhood memories of many people, so it's very attractive," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It would be nice to have a longer exhibition or displays around different parts of Hong Kong... so that adults and kids can all come and take photos."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Free Doraemon balloons were also handed out in several busy districts in Hong Kong, including Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Causeway Bay and Central, with most of them distributed in about two hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The full exhibition, the first stop on a global tour and also listed on the government's "mega events calendar," gets under way on July 13 and runs until August 4, featuring a special animated short film.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 S K Lam from the event organiser said the film depicts one of the characters, Gian, mostly known for being an aggressive bully in the series, holding a concert in Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The film will be part of the paid exhibition, but fans can also visit large-scale figures of Doraemon for free at the Avenue of Stars.

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754689_1_20240525213215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli official said on Saturday the government had an "intention" to renew "this week" talks aimed at reaching a hostage release deal in Gaza, after a meeting in Paris between US and Israeli officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There is an intention to renew the talks this week and there is an agreement," the official said, on condition of anonymity.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Israeli official did not elaborate on the agreement, but Israeli media reported that Mossad chief David Barnea had agreed during meetings in Paris with mediators CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani on a new framework for the stalled negotiations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken also spoke with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz about new efforts to achieve a ceasefire and reopen the Rafah border crossing, Washington said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Talks aimed at reaching a hostage release and truce deal in the Gaza Strip ground to a halt this month after Israel launched a military operation in the territory's far-southern city of Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a based on Israeli official figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,903 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Uvalde families sue 'Call of Duty' gamemaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Floral tributes are placed outside the school in Uvalde after the 2022 shooting. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754667_1_20240525151710.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Families of the victims of the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, filed two lawsuits on Friday against Instagram's parent company Meta, Activision Blizzard and its parent Microsoft and the gunmaker Daniel Defense, claiming they cooperated to market dangerous weapons to impressionable teens such as the Uvalde shooter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Together, the wrongful death complaints argue that Daniel Defense – a Georgia-based gun manufacturer – used Instagram and Activision's video game Call of Duty to market its assault-style rifles to teenage boys, while Meta and Microsoft facilitated the strategy with lax oversight and no regard for the consequences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meta, Microsoft and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, a lobbying group representing the video game industry, said many other countries have similar levels of video game playing but less gun violence than the United States.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," the group said in a statement. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In one of the deadliest school shootings in history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when an 18-year-old gunman armed with a Daniel Defense rifle entered Robb Elementary School and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The complaints were filed on the two-year anniversary of the massacre by Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the same law firm that reached a US$73 million settlement with rifle manufacturer Remington in 2022 on behalf of families of children killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The first lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Meta's Instagram of giving gun manufacturers "an unsupervised channel to speak directly to minors, in their homes, at school, even in the middle of the night," with only token oversight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The complaint also alleges that Activision's popular warfare game Call of Duty "creates a vividly realistic and addicting theatre of violence in which teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease," using real-life weapons as models for the game's firearms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The second lawsuit, filed in Uvalde County District Court, accuses Daniel Defense of deliberately aiming its ads at adolescent boys in an effort to secure lifelong customers. (Reuters)

    Runaway emu shocks passers-by in Tin Shui Wai

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rogue emu was spotted pounding the streets of Tin Shui Wai on Saturday morning, shocking residents and rapidly going viral on social media.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Emus are normally found in the Australian outback, rather than Hong Kong public housing estates, but video widely shared online showed one of the flightless birds exploring different parts of the town in the northern New Territories.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Aside from the estate, the emu was spotted running up and down busy roads, at one point forcing a lorry driver to slam on the breaks to avoid a collision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After calls from people who saw the runaway at the junction of Tin Sau Road and Tin Ying Road, inspectors from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals moved in.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They were joined in the search by police officers and officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About three hours later, the emu found its way into the nearby wetlands park, where it was caught, uninjured, and handed over to the AFCD for safekeeping.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials say they've so far been unable to contact the farm the emu came from.

    Wide range of mega events a must for HK: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should not limit the kind of mega events it stages, culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Saturday, dismissing concerns that an abundance of shows and exhibitions could diminish their appeal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR has more than 100 mega events scheduled for the latter half of this year, from sporting contests to summits, but lawmaker Doreen Kong earlier said she's worried that too many big events would lead to a loss of focus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on an RTHK programme, Yeung said diversity was important to cater to different audiences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "For tourists, they may be travelling to Hong Kong for a week to participate in a mega event they are interested in...But in Hong Kong, it does seem that 200 mega events are a lot, with all sorts of shows and activities," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We hope that Hong Kong is a diverse place with many mega events, and different people who come here can find what they want to take part in. We also want to let everyone know that Hong Kong is capable and has hosted various types of mega events."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This year's mega events are expected to draw 1.7 million visitors, out of a predicted 46 million total arrivals. But the minister stressed that mega events were not the only away to attract tourists.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We do not solely rely on one aspect to attract people. We already have a number of projects, for example, existing tourist hotspots and in-depth tours. The estimated figure also do not include the number of people attending concerts," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So we shouldn't only look at the mega events on the roster. It's more about the atmosphere of the city after holding mega events, and making the city more attractive."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yeung also said the administration was in talks with the filmmakers behind the hit local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" about turning its set into a tourist site. The film attracted a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and has sparked international interest in its setting: the long-demolished Kowloon Walled City.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the minister also acknowledged the possibility of the filmmakers requiring the sets again to produce a prequel or sequel to the martial arts film.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Increasing penalties alone will not be enough to deal with the problem of property owners ignoring fire safety orders, a lawmaker said on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tony Tse made the comments after the government said this week that it intended to submit an amendment bill to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who ignore such instructions. It follows the deaths of five people in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan, a building subject to a series of fire safety notices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials are proposing to raise the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tony Tse, who represents the architectural, surveying, planning and landscape sectors, said legislation alone was not the answer and that owners should be informed that they are responsible for carrying out maintenance and repair work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “[For] those who have little knowledge or no knowledge about this area, we should all offer some sort of assistance. That could be coming from the government, or some professional institutions, as well as some volunteering persons who have knowledge about it," Tse said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Election Committee lawmaker Andrew Lam said that while it's "inevitable" that stricter penalties for non-compliance would be introduced, the government should strengthen inter-departmental cooperation to tackle such issues.

 The group behind a 2019 protest song that's subject to a court injunction said on Friday evening that the distributor had now decided to remove it from all platforms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On social media, the group behind "Glory to Hong Kong" said it has expressed opposition to the decision, saying it hoped to have the song reinstated as soon as possible.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The group said the song had been removed from iTunes and Apple Music in various regions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Court of Appeal earlier granted a government request for a temporary injunction against anyone playing or performing the song with seditious intent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, has since restricted the viewing of 32 links related to the song in Hong Kong.

    Alec Baldwin set to face trial over movie shooting

<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico judge on Friday rejected Alec Baldwin's bid to dismiss an involuntary manslaughter charge for the 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, opening the way for an unprecedented trial of a Hollywood actor for an on-set death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Baldwin's lawyers argued at a May 17 hearing that a grand jury indictment of the actor was "a sham" as prosecutors failed to tell jurors they could question defence witnesses and stopped them hearing evidence helpful to the actor's case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among her arguments in a court filing, district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said she did not find prosecutorial bad faith in the grand jury, nor error in jury instructions and prosecutors adequately advised jurors regarding a letter from Baldwin's legal team listing defence jurors they could call.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The court finds no error in the actions taken by the prosecutor vis-a-vi the reading of the evidence letter," Marlowe Sommer said in the filing
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The actor now faces a July 10 trial.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hutchins was shot with a live round after Baldwin pointed a gun at her as she set up a camera shot on a movie set near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The "30 Rock" actor maintains he did not pull the trigger, an assertion that has become central to the case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Much of the differences between prosecution and defence positions are factual disputes and that is the type of case juries are meant to decide, said business and entertainment trial litigator Tre Lovell.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At trial, Baldwin’s legal team must convince Santa Fe jurors there was a cascading failure in set firearms safety before the weapon was put in Baldwin’s hand,
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey has argued in court filings that Baldwin broke firearm safety rules by pointing the gun at Hutchins, cocking it and pulling the trigger.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sommer sentenced "Rust" armorer Hannah Gutierrez to 18 months prison in April after a Santa Fe jury found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter for loading the live round into the reproduction Colt Single Action Army revolver Baldwin was using. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 "Black Dog," about a man released from prison who returns home to his remote town in China to rid it of stray dogs before the Olympics, only to befriend one of them, won the Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" competition on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Eddie Peng, who stars as Lang in the film by director Guan Hu, attended the ceremony at Cannes along with greyhound Xin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was the second prize in one day for Xin, who donned the Palm Dog red collar after being picked for the Grand Jury Prize at a separate ceremony celebrating canine performances.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The "Un Certain Regard" jury prize went to the French film "The Story of Souleymane," director Boris Lojkine's feature about a Guinean immigrant's struggle to survive in Paris.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The best director prize was given to both Italy's Roberto Minervini for "The Damned" and Zambian-Welsh auteur Rungano Nyoni for "On Becoming a Guinea Fowl," while "Norah," by Saudi Arabian director Tawfik Alzaidi, received a special mention.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Canadian filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan headed this year's five-strong jury for the competition focused on arthouse films that runs parallel to the main competition, the Palme d'Or.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There were 18 films in total competing for the prize. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Algernon Yau, left, says Hong Kong businesses can do more to attract investors from the Middle East and Asean countries. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754529_1_20240524143042.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau says claims that Hong Kong was no longer the Pearl of the Orient and its status has been overtaken by Singapore were absolutely not true, citing the SAR’s unique advantage of its proximity to the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think it’s not true at all. Hong Kong has the advantage over the others because we have the back-up of the motherland. We are a super connector and a value adder,” Yau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The secretary for commerce and economic development said Hong Kong is positioned to capture business opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, which has a population of 86 million with GDP of US$1.3 trillion. The size of the GBA economy is comparable to that of South Korea or some northern European countries, Yau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Using Hong Kong as a gateway going into the Greater Bay Area is our advantage,” Yau told RTHK’s Your Home Address programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also highlighted that Hong Kong is the only common law city in China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The rule of law, free low of capital, good infrastructure and professional services… are all available in Hong Kong which are very competitive to any other economy in the world,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To attract more foreign businesses to operate in Hong Kong, Yau said, “We need to change”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister hailed a business trip led by the Chief Executive John Lee to the Middle East and Asean countries last year, adding that Hong Kong businesses need to look at how to accommodate new investors coming from those parts of the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The whole world is changing, the situation is evolving and we have to look at new opportunities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Without changing, we won’t be able to entertain the new investors, visitors or tourists coming from the Middle East especially,” the secretary said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yau also revealed that Hong Kong will be hosting a Belt and Road summit in September as part of a month-long Belt and Road festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister, whose policy portfolio also covers broadcasting, said he is trying to foster a more dynamic environment for the industry. He said there are more programmes on RTHK about education and culture on the mainland.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained lost ground on Friday to trade higher ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend, with renewed enthusiasm for generative AI-linked companies pushing Nvidia's share price.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent to 16,920, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,304.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones stabilised after tumbling on Thursday to close almost unchanged at 39,069.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While stocks often rise ahead of the Memorial day weekend, Friday's buoyant trading day also had Nvidia's recent streak to thank, said Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company, which sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in many generative AI products, saw its share price rise 2.6 percent on Friday, leaving it up more than 15 percent this week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We know that expectations were very high, and yet they seem to meet or exceed them on more than one level," he said. "So whether we like it or not, artificial intelligence now is an important factor when it comes to the stock market sentiment."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "And to the extent that Nvidia's numbers were able to meet or beat expectations that's supportive for the market," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Other tech companies that saw their share price jump on Friday include Advanced Micro Devices, which closed up 3.7 percent, and Intel, which finished 2.1 percent higher. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States on Friday announced a fresh tranche of military aid for Ukraine, including ammunition, missiles, mines and artillery rounds as Russia presses its assault on the Kharkiv region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ukraine has been battling back in Kharkiv since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The United States is announcing today a significant new drawdown of weapons and equipment for Ukraine to support the brave Ukrainian people as they defend their country," said Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This 275 million dollar package, which is part of our efforts to help Ukraine repel Russia's assault near Kharkiv, contains urgently needed capabilities."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last month, US lawmakers passed a long-delayed US$61 billion military aid deal for Kyiv after months of squabbling in Congress as Ukrainian forces suffered setbacks on the battlefield due to ammunition and funding shortages.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since then, President Joe Biden has ordered five tranches of military aid to be sent to Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Assistance from previous packages has already made it to the front lines, and we will move this new assistance as quickly as possible," Blinken said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Strikes on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, killed at least seven people on Thursday, local authorities said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 11,000 people in the wider region have been evacuated since Russia began its new offensive, according to local governor Oleg Synegubov. (AFP)

    SpaceX mega rocket Starship's next launch on June 5

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The last test took place on March 14, when Starship flew halfway around the planet. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754608_1_20240525004618.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starship, the world's most powerful rocket, is set for its next test flight on June 5, SpaceX announced on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The launch window from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas opens at 7:00 am local time (1200 GMT), pending regulatory approval.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It will be the fourth test for the sleek mega rocket, which is vital to Nasa's plans for landing astronauts on the Moon later this decade, and to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's hopes of eventually colonising Mars.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Three previous attempts have ended in the Starship's destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy," SpaceX said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Super Heavy is the booster, while Starship refers to both the upper stage and the two stages combined.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The flight path will be similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly halfway around the globe before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This time around, SpaceX hopes to achieve a soft splashdown for the booster stage in the Gulf of Mexico, and a "controlled entry" for the upper stage.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Designed to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 121 metres tall with both stages combined – 27 metres taller than the Statue of Liberty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, almost double that of the world's second most powerful rocket, Nasa's Space Launch System – though the latter is now certified, while Starship is still a prototype.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 SpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for Nasa and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for Nasa's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the lander vehicle. (AFP)

    Some 45,000 Rohingya have fled fighting in Myanmar: UN

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations warned on Friday that escalating fighting in conflict-torn Myanmar's Rakhine State had forced around 45,000 minority Rohingya to flee, amid allegations of killings and burnings of property.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced in recent days by the fighting in Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships," UN rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told reporters in Geneva.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "An estimated 45,000 Rohingya have reportedly fled to an area on the Naf River near the border with Bangladesh, seeking protection," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Clashes have rocked Rakhine since the Arakan Army (AA) attacked forces of the ruling junta in November, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since a military coup in 2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The AA says it is fighting for more autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine population in the state, which is also home to around 600,000 members of the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Rakhine in 2017 during a crackdown by the military that is now the subject of a United Nations genocide court case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Over a million Rohingya are already in Bangladesh, having fled past purges," Throssell pointed out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UN rights chief Volker Turk was urging Bangladesh and other countries "to provide effective protection to those seeking it, in line with international law, and to ensure international solidarity with Bangladesh in hosting Rohingya refugees in Myanmar", she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Novak Djokovic fell to 44th-ranked Czech Tomas Machac, 6-4, 0-6, 6-1, in the semi-finals in Geneva on Friday ahead of his French Open title defence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Djokovic, 37, took a wild card to the Swiss clay-court tournament in a bid to reverse an alarming dip in form ahead of Roland Garros where the 24-time Grand Slam champion has won three times.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have no reaction right now, I just fought for every ball," said 23-year-old Machac.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "When you play against Novak you just hope. You just try to play your best and see what it looks like."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Djokovic, bidding to reach his first final of the season, received a medical timeout at the end of the first set.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Serb will head to Roland Garros where he faces Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the first round having won no titles this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Machac, competing in his maiden tour-level semi-final, rallied from a break down in the first set and after failing to win a game in the second powered back in the third set.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm looking forward to playing in a final for the first time," said Machac who will face two-time champion Casper Ruud or Italian Flavio Cobolli in the title match on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ruud, the world number seven, was the runner-up in the last two French Open finals, including a defeat to Djokovic last year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Judges at the top United Nations court ordered Israel on Friday to halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Reading out a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or World Court, the body's president Nawaf Salam said provisional measures ordered by the court in March did not fully address the situation in the besieged Palestinian enclave, and conditions had been met for a new emergency order.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive" in Rafah, he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The court backed a South African request to order Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a week after Pretoria called for the measure in a case accusing Israel of genocide.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel has repeatedly dismissed the case's accusations of genocide as baseless, arguing in court that its operations in Gaza are self-defence and targeted at Hamas militants who attacked Israel on October 7.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An Israeli government spokesman said "no power on Earth would stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel launched its assault on the southern city of Rafah this month, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee a city that had become a refuge to around half of the population's 2.3 million people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While the ruling by the ICJ is a blow to Israel's international standing, the court does not have a police force to enforce its orders. In another case on its docket, Russia has so far ignored a 2022 order by the court to halt its military campaign in Ukraine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers universities in the United States defended their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force, telling a US House committee on Thursday that they defused the danger without ceding ground to protesters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We had to get the encampment down,” Northwestern's Michael Schill said. “The police solution was not going to be available to us to keep people safe, and also may not be the wisest solution as we’ve seen at other campuses across the country.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Schill and Jonathan Holloway of Rutgers were called before the House Education and the Workforce Committee as part of a series of hearings examining how colleges have responded to allegations of antisemitism.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Also testifying was Gene Block, chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, which has come under scrutiny for a delayed police response to violence between pro-Palestinian protesters and counter-protesters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The committee’s inquiry expanded to large, public universities, UCLA and Rutgers, after earlier hearings largely focused on private, Ivy League colleges.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Philadelphia, protesters packed up their belongings and left a pro-Palestinian encampment at Drexel University after the school announced a decision to have police clear the encampment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 University President John Fry said in a statement that he decided to have campus police and public safety officers join Philadelphia police in clearing the encampment as peacefully as possible.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 News outlets reported that police gave protesters a warning to clear the encampment and the protesters left.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of students in graduation robes walked out of the Harvard University commencement chanting “Free, free Palestine” after weeks of protests on campus and a day after the school announced that 13 students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk” during Thursday’s commencement, referring to allowing those 13 students to get their diplomas along with fellow graduates. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese dog whose photo inspired a generation of oddball online jokes and the US$23-billion Dogecoin cryptocurrency died on Friday, her owner said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She quietly passed away as if asleep while I caressed her," Atsuko Sato wrote on her blog, thanking the fans of her shiba inu called Kabosu – the face of the "Doge" meme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Kabo-chan was the happiest dog in the world. And I was the happiest owner," Sato wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a rescue dog, Kabosu's real birthday was unknown but Sato estimated her age at 18, past the average lifespan for a shiba inu, with her birthday celebrated in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2010, two years after adopting Kabosu from a puppy mill where she would otherwise have been put down, Sato took a picture of her pet crossing her paws on the sofa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She posted that image – with the fluffy shiba inu giving the camera a beguiling look – on her blog, from where it spread to online forum Reddit and became a meme that bounced from college bedrooms to office e-mail chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The memes typically used goofy broken English to reveal the inner thoughts of Kabosu and other shiba inu "doge" – pronounced like pizza "dough" but with a "j" at the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The picture also later became an NFT digital artwork that sold for US$4 million and inspired Dogecoin, which was started as a joke by two software engineers and is now the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency with a market capitalisation of US$23 billion. (AFP)

    US sanctions will have no impact on DoJ: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said any US sanctions aimed at Hong Kong judges and officials will have no impact on the Department of Justice.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam's comment came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on a number of SAR officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Blinken said this was in response to what he described as "an intensifying crackdown on rights and freedoms" in Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on his return from an official visit to the Middle East, Lam reiterated his opposition to any such sanctions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As we have reiterated many times, these actions and statements violate fundamental principles of international law. Secondly, these remarks or expressions will absolutely not affect me personally or the work of our Department of Justice. They will not have the slightest impact whatsoever," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The justice chief also said he explained Hong Kong's common law system to the business sector in the Middle East during his five-day trip there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam said there are many opportunities for cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, as the SAR can help connect investors and businesspeople there to China and the rest of the world.

    Lawmakers differ on pushing or shelving waste charging

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday were divided on the way forward for the planned citywide waste charging scheme, with one believing the policy should not go to waste.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a paper to the Legislative Council, the administration said people who took part in a trial believed the measure was causing a nuisance to the public and complained the designated bags would be too expensive.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Legislator Tik Chi-yuen, from the Third Side, said the city should continue pushing for the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We have sufficient conditions to continue with the plan. It doesn't matter what the policy will be called, whether it's a second phase of the trial, or operating it in different modes," Tik told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We should introduce this scheme to places with management capabilities, including public housing, subsidised housing, large-scale private residential estates, as well as premises of the government and the public sector."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But DAB lawmaker, Edward Lau, said the government should shelve the waste charging scheme "indefinitely". He said introducing the policy on schedule would cause chaos.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The government should hold off on introducing the scheme and look into areas that should be improved. That's because many issues were reflected in the report and it's impossible to fail to deal with them," Lau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Only when conditions permit and the timing is right, then the government can bring it back to Legco for discussions."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kwok Wai-keung from the Federation of Trade Unions said it could be worth amending the time frame in which to roll out the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Other than strengthening our recycling facilities, we hope the government can provide a detailed timetable. If we are going to carry out works on waste charging and reduction, the government should say how many stages should there be," Kwok said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said there should be a test run for everyone to take part in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army on Friday continued joint drills surrounding Taiwan Island.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Integrated operations inside and outside the island chain are being conducted to test the command's capabilities to jointly take control of battlefield and launch joint strikes, and to seize control of crucial areas, according to Li Xi, spokesperson for the theatre command.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A coast guard fleet conducted law-enforcement drills in the waters east of the island.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said the drills focused on subjects including verification and identification as well as warning and expulsion to test the capabilities of joint maritime patrol and emergency response.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China said the two-day military exercises, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, were launched to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and strongly punish separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end and China will never waver in its resolve to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Environment and Ecology Bureau has not given any indication of what will be the next for the pay-as-you-throw scheme. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754537_1_20240524151224.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday said a number of people who trialled the pay-as-you-throw scheme think the government should hold off on rolling out the plan to everyone in August, believing the measure was causing a nuisance to the public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But in a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Environment and Ecology Bureau gave no indication of what would be next for the municipal solid waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials began trialling the scheme at 14 locations from April, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said the bags were used 70 percent of the time at shopping malls participating in the test run, but there were fewer residents who used them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The average usage rate [of designated bags] at public and private housing buildings ranged from only about 20 percent to more than 50 percent, and only around 20 percent at 'three-nil' buildings," the paper said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A "three-nil" building is one which does not have an owners' corporation or any form of residents' organisation, nor does it employ a property management company to manage the building.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials said many residents thought charging for disposed waste was causing a nuisance and complained the bags would be too expensive, while voicing concerns that littering would happen more often once the measure took effect.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some also believed it was difficult to understand how to dispose of items larger than the designated bags, the bureau said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "[Residents polled] suggested to scrap waste charging or let society fully understand and prepare for it, thus it is not appropriate to introduce the scheme as scheduled on August 1," the paper said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau noted that frontline cleaning staff had seen their workload increase from handling trash that was not thrown out properly.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some expressed a concern about conflicts with residents when the policy was introduced or even breaking the law unknowingly, with certain individuals planning to quit because of the scheme, officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For restaurants, shops and care homes, they pointed to a rise in operating costs and recommended improving the design of larger garbage bags.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The administration said certain locations, such as residential blocks, care homes, restaurants and government premises, saw a 10 to 20 percent decrease in the amount of garbage disposed during the test run.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added there was a rise in the type and amount of recyclables collected.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian media reports on Friday said more than 100 people were believed to have been killed Friday in a landslide that buried a village in a remote part of Papua New Guinea.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The landslide reportedly hit Kaokalam village in Enga province early on Friday morning, about 600 kilometres northwest of the South Pacific island nation's capital of Port Moresby, ABC reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Provincial governor Peter Ipatas told international media there had been a big landslide "causing loss of life and property" amid unconfirmed reports that hundreds may be buried.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He later said that "more than six villages" had been hit, describing the scene as an "unprecedented natural disaster" that had caused "substantial damages".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A rapid response team of medics, military, police and UN agencies was dispatched to the area to assess the damage and help the injured. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association on Friday said its chairwoman, Josephine Ip, has resigned.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On its website, the association said Ip's move was down to personal reasons.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 First vice-chairman Yu Sum-por will take over from Ip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) said it is aware of Ip's resignation and respects the decision made by her and the association.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In recent months, the SAR government twice criticised Ip for remarks she made in public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier this month, she said an event featuring competitors representing the Hong Kong SAR and Chinese Taipei had lifters from "13 countries".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In another incident, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a slip of the tongue.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Culture, Sports, and Tourism Bureau on Friday expressed its gratitude to the SF&OC for addressing Ip's blunders, which it described as "completely unacceptable."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau again urged the SF&OC to enhance training for its affiliates, to prevent such incidents from happening again.

    DAB calls on govt to shelve waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called on the government to shelve plans to roll out household waste charging, saying surveys it has carried out show this is what the majority of people want.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that authorities should not see the policy as the only means to reduce waste.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The party said only 18.4 percent of 810 people it polled by phone in April thought the pay-as-you-throw scheme should go ahead as planned in August, and only 15 percent of 750 people polled in May thought the same.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Around 30 percent of the interviewees said the policy should be delayed a third time, while 45 percent said it should be scrapped entirely, the DAB said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The party said people feel there are not enough recycling facilities, and that having to pay for designated bags for waste would be a financial burden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said authorities should take more time to help Hong Kong get ready for the scheme, by building waste-to-energy infrastructure, setting up more recycling stations across the city and providing detailed recycling guidelines.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said the administration can also provide cash rewards for those who recycle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They have a reward scheme to encourage citizens to [recycle] but now the scheme is that you do recycling and then you get some points, which can be used to redeem noodles or oil, that kind of thing. I think if you can redeem cash, you will have a better incentive," Quat said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chief Executive John Lee said earlier in the week that even though the pay-as-you-go measure was made law by the previous administration, authorities should still put thought into how the scheme is executed.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown scored a game-high 40 points and grabbed five rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics to a 126-110 victory over the visiting Indiana Pacers on Thursday in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Brown was 14 of 27 from the floor and made 8 of 11 free throws. Boston had a 13-point lead after three quarters and the Pacers were never closer than 11 points in the fourth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The victory gave Boston a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, which will shift to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Saturday. The Pacers have a 6-0 home record in the playoffs this season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indiana point guard Tyrese Haliburton left the game in the third quarter with left leg soreness. He collected 10 points and eight assists in 28 minutes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Pascal Siakam made 13 of 17 field-goal attempts and led the Pacers with 28 points. Andrew Nembhard added 16 points for Indiana.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Jayson Tatum and Derrick White each scored 23 points for the Celtics. Al Horford had six points and a team-high 10 rebounds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Brown led all first-half scorers with 24 points. Boston trailed 27-25 after one quarter but held a 57-51 halftime lead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Boston surged in front thanks to a 20-0 run. The Celtics scored the final three points in the first quarter and the first 17 points in the second quarter to take a 42-27 lead. Indiana didn't score in the second quarter until Aaron Nesmith made two free throws with 6:45 remaining in the quarter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indiana was within two points, 68-66, after Siakam's 3-pointer with 7:55 remaining in the third, but Boston had a 93-80 advantage entering the final 12 minutes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Celtics' Luke Kornet left the game in the first quarter with a sprained left wrist and did not return to the court.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that ripped through a small apartment block in central Hanoi has killed at least 14 people and injured three others, state media said Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The fire broke out at around 12.30am. The fire was big, with several explosions," the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 By 6.20am, at least 14 people had died and three were injured, VNA cited local officials as saying.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was not clear how many people were in the flat at the time the fire broke out. The flames were extinguished after an hour.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The building is situated down a two-metre-wide alley, with the top floors of the building rented out, VNA said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The first floor was reportedly used for the selling and fixing of electric bicycles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A neighbour, who declined to give her name, said she heard an "explosion like fire crackers".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I thought there was a fight, or something hitting the window. I ran down and saw the fire.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Many of the neighbours had run out of the alley, crossing through other neighbours' houses. We were so, so scared." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished sharply lower on Thursday after blowout earnings by Nvidia failed to ignite a broad rally.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Stocks had opened higher, but analysts cited an uptick in US Treasury bond yields as a driver of the reversal. Market watchers also noted a tendency in equities to sell off after big rallies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "You've had huge runs since mid-April and there's an inclination to take some money off the table," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones finished down 1.5 percent at 39,065.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent to 5,267, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 16,736.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, artificial intelligence player Nvidia surged 9.3 percent after reporting a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Live Nation Entertainment dropped 7.8 percent after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit, arguing the company, which owns ticketing behemoth Ticketmaster, should be broken up.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Boeing plunged 7.6 percent after the company's CFO predicted another quarter of meagre plane deliveries, likely resulting in negative cash for all of 2024.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Retail company VF, which owns Timberland and other outdoor apparel brands, fell 2.9 percent after reporting a US$418.3 million loss in the most recent quarter. The company said a turnround is on track. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754458_1_20240524041833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Justice filed a major antitrust lawsuit on Thursday seeking to break up the alleged monopoly held by Live Nation Entertainment and its Ticketmaster subsidiary in the live music industry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York, alleges that Live Nation has abused its dominant market position to raise ticket fees, squeeze out competitors and limit choices for fans, venues and artists.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators," said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is time to break up Live Nation."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ticketmaster's pricing practices for concerts and sports events, with high fees and lack of alternatives, have long been a political issue in the United States, with little done historically to open up the market to more competition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Widespread outages and exorbitant fees caused an uproar, with lawmakers in Washington holding hearings to question Live Nation-Ticketmaster executives over the debacle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The move by US officials against Live Nation also came as the Biden administration, according to polls, is seen by voters as failing to do enough to curb inflation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 High prices have become a key issue in battleground states ahead of the 2024 election that pits Biden against former president Donald Trump.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement, Live Nation said the lawsuit "won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Calling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment," it added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, has grown into a US$22 billion global giant that produces over 30,000 concerts annually for nearly 500 touring artists across its network of over 265 venues in North America.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company has fought back against allegations it harms the ticketing industry, saying it brought innovation and lower prices because of its national reach.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the DOJ counters that US fans still pay higher fees with "outdated technology" compared to other countries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The lawsuit detailed allegations of unlawful tactics by Live Nation to maintain its dominance, including "threatening and retaliating against venues" by signalling they could lose concerts and revenue if they work with rivals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 68-page suit paints Live Nation-Ticketmaster as operating a "self-reinforcing business model" that allows it to capture revenue from ticket sales and then use that revenue to lock up artists to exclusive promotion deals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It then leverages its access to top performers to sign venues into long-term exclusive ticketing deals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fights against Ticketmaster's power go back to the 1990s, when the rock band Pearl Jam refused to perform at Ticketmaster venues in protest at its service charges that increased ticket prices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ticketmaster was accused of organising a boycott of Pearl Jam's tour, and the band eventually gave up its campaign against the ticketing giant. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi was laid to rest on Thursday, concluding days of funeral rites attended by throngs of mourners after his death in a helicopter crash, state media reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hundreds of thousands marched in his home town Mashhad to bid farewell to Raisi ahead of his burial following processions in the cities of Tabriz, Qom, Tehran and Birjand.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 63-year-old died on Sunday alongside his foreign minister and six others after their helicopter went down in the country's mountainous northwest while returning from a dam inauguration on the border with Azerbaijan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Once the five days of public mourning, announced on Monday, have passed, the authorities including acting President Mohammad Mokhber will focus on organising an election for a new president set for June 28.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Men and women, who were mainly clad in black chadors and clutching white flowers, crowded the main boulevard of Mashhad, the Islamic republic's second city in the northeast where Raisi was born.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some held aloft placards paying tribute to Raisi as the "man of the battlefield" as a large truck carrying his body drove through the sea of mourners.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have come, O king, give me refuge," said a slogan emblazoned on top of the truck, in reference to Imam Reza, the eighth imam of Shiite Islam.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Posters of Raisi, black flags and Shi'ite symbols were erected along the streets of Mashhad, particularly around Raisi's final resting place – the Imam Reza shrine, a key mausoleum visited by millions of pilgrims every year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier thousands of people holding images of Raisi and waving flags lined the streets of Birjand, capital of the eastern province of South Khorasan, for the procession of Raisi's coffin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Raisi was South Khorasan's representative in the Assembly of Experts, a clerical body in charge of selecting or dismissing Iran's supreme leader.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Raisi had widely been expected to succeed supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who led prayers in Tehran on Wednesday for the late president and knelt before the coffins of the eight people killed in the helicopter crash.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among them was foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who was buried on Thursday in the shrine of Shah Abdol-Azim in the town of Shahre Ray south of the capital. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal was drawn to face world number four Alexander Zverev in a blockbuster opening match at his farewell French Open tournament on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nadal, the record 14-time champion at Roland Garros, is unseeded this year after injury saw his ranking plummet to 276.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He and Zverev met in the semi-finals of the French Open in 2022 when the German was forced to retire after suffering a serious ankle injury.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nadal, the winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, will turn 38 next week and this season will be his last on tour.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He holds a 7-3 winning head-to-head record against Germany's Zverev with five of those victories coming on clay.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zverev, 27, arrives in Paris on the back of lifting the Rome Open title last weekend. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The North Atlantic hurricane season, which starts on June 1, is forecast to be "extraordinary," with between four and seven hurricanes of Category 3 or higher expected, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather agency said on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Category 3 storms pack wind speeds over 178 kilometres an hour and wreak devastating damage on houses, uproot trees and often cut off electricity and water for days or even weeks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This season is looking to be an extraordinary one in a number of ways," said Rick Spinrad of the NOAA, which cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and La Nina conditions in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said human-caused climate change was warming oceans and melting ice on land, leading to sea level rises that worsen storm surges.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The forecast for named storms – hurricanes and major hurricanes – is the highest NOAA has ever issued for the May outlook," Spinrad said. "It only takes one storm to devastate a community."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Oceanic heat in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea creates more energy to fuel storms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hurricane Ian, which struck Florida in September 2022, caused 152 deaths and losses worth US$112.9 billion. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The man charged with shooting and seriously wounding Slovakia's prime minister said he did so to oppose the government's Ukraine policy but regrets his actions, according to a court document.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slovakia was left reeling last week after the head of government, Robert Fico, was struck by four bullets while greeting supporters in the central town of Handlova.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was rushed to hospital and underwent two lengthy operations in nearby Banska Bystrica. The hospital on Thursday said that he remains in a "serious but stable" condition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The alleged gunman, identified by Slovak media as 71-year-old poet Juraj Cintula, has been charged with premeditated attempted murder and was remanded in custody at a hearing on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "During the interrogation, he stated that since he does not agree with the policy of the current government... he decided to act," pretrial judge Roman Puchovsky wrote in a decision on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The accused notably said he disagreed with the government's decision to abolish the special prosecutor's office and to stop sending military aid to Ukraine, as well as alleged media persecution.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He repeated that he did not want to kill (name redacted) but wanted to wound him and impair his health, that he aimed at his lower torso," Puchovsky wrote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He realises that he acted completely impermissibly, that he should not have harmed the victim," the judge added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He sincerely regrets his actions."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The attempted assassination has highlighted acute political divisions in Slovakia, where 59-year-old Fico took office in October after his Smer party won a general election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Now serving his fourth term as prime minister, Fico soured ties with Ukraine after he questioned the neighbouring country's sovereignty as it battles Russian forces. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A tornado that ripped through the midwestern US state of Iowa killed five people and left dozens injured, officials said, with homes smashed to pieces and cars thrown through the air.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Residents surveyed the wreckage of flattened buildings and uprooted trees after the storm left a path of destruction across the town of Greenfield on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Four fatalities and at least 35 injuries were the result of the tornado that impacted the Greenfield, Adair County area," the Iowa State Patrol said Wednesday, adding that the number of injured could still rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The local hospital was damaged and some patients were moved to other facilities, while airlift flights were also undertaken after the storm slammed the town of 2,000 residents 70 kilometres from state capital Des Moines.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 100 emergency workers combed through the debris, said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, while local officials reported at least one other person was also killed in nearby Adams County.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tornado reports in the United States have been far above average in recent weeks, according to CNN, with more than 800 tornadoes this year making it one of the most active on record. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Thursday said an outbreak of gastroenteritis at the Eastern Hospital has affected at least 43 staff members.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CHP said the outbreak was likely caused by environmental contamination or person-to-person transmission of norovirus, noting that more than half of the affected staff members work in the East Block of the institution.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It has ordered the hospital to disinfect the area immediately, along with other places the workers visited.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While the Hospital Authority earlier said some affected workers had consumed food from two hospital canteens, the CHP said not all of them had done so. It added that its officers did not find any irregularities when they inspected the cafeterias.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The patients, aged between 20 and 62, are all in stable condition, the CHP added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) on Thursday confirmed that Kam Kee Catering Group has failed to settle around HK$3.1 million in MPF contributions and relevant surcharges.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authority said the restaurant chain did not make MPF contributions for around 980 employees between February and March this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The MPFA on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in the High Court against the company, on behalf of affected employees.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authority reminded employers that it is their legal responsibility to make MPF contributions on time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Labour Department, meanwhile, said it is handling claims of unpaid salaries and other legal matters from around 60 Kam Kee employees.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It called on other workers to get in touch if they have any queries or concerns.

    Fabric market beautified for designers and tourists

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Thursday said a makeover of Sham Shui Po's fabric market could attract young designers and tourists to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sham Shui Po Fabric Market relocated to Tung Chau Street from Yen Chow Street Hawker Bazaar last year to make way for public housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market currently has space for 50 stalls with 30 currently in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The district officer of Sham Shui Po, Paul Wong, said that bright orange reflective panels that had been installed at the venue represent hope for the fashion and design industry in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you're interested in fashion design and DIYs, Sham Shui Po has been your dream destination for many years. Giving these new destinations a push, we can attract more young designers or people who are interested in the design creative industry to come to Sham Shui Po to mingle with other designers and take inspiration," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the beautification project, which they have dubbed "Fabrimark", would bring more exposure and business to the market, while maintaining the textile trade's heritage and history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a strong and long heritage of textile and clothing industry in Sham Shui Po, so riding on the opening of the Hong Kong Design Centre in the fourth quarter of this year, we think this is a good opportunity to combine the new development and our heritage to showcase the fashion design industry, the design industry in general and the textile and clothing heritage of Sham Shui Po."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the beautification work would last around nine months, costing approximately HK$50,000 per month, adding there was an opportunity for an extension depending on its maintenance.

    Drainage Services steps up flood prevention efforts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Drainage Services Department is building a 64,000 cubic metre water storage tank in Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754400_1_20240523171706.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Drainage Services Department said it was taking proactive measures to mitigate the risk of flooding as the rainy season approaches.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During a press briefing on Thursday, the department stressed that flooding cannot be totally be avoided due to climate change but said it would adopt a multi-pronged approach to reduce the risk.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Besides more frequent inspections of the drainage system, it also plans to use artificial intelligence in more scenarios, such as deploying AI-powered robots to clear obstructions in drains and manholes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok also said the department was developing an AI analysis tool to gather rainstorm data to help predict floods in future.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are collaborating with a university team…we need to collect a large amount of data on site to train the computer, to recognise flooding and also to predict it,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Having to collect the information from [the Hong Kong Observatory] from the coming rainstorm data, we hope the AI model can predict the water depth in the near future during the rainstorms.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a demonstration for the media, the department also showcased the construction progress of a storm water storage tank on Sau Nga Road in Kwun Tong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tank is capable of storing around 64,000 cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to 26 standard swimming pools, and is part of a major project to improve drainage in the surrounding area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HK$930 million water storage tank was expected to be completed in 2028 and Mok said the price tag was reasonable given the scale and complexity of the project.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “During the heavy rainfall, we need to temporarily store the rainwater in the storage tank and wait until the bad weather and the heavy rainfall has gone,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We will discharge the rainwater subsequently when the rainfall intensity has reduced…because of the quite large volume of the excavation and the quite large volume of the tank, the cost of the storage scheme is at that level.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added the department’s ongoing review of flooding black spots would be completed by the end of the year.

 The operator of the Precious Blood Hospital in Sham Shui Po said on Thursday that the institution will remain non-profit making despite its decision to partner up with a private medical group to expand services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Catholic charity Caritas said it will work with Parkway Medical Services to redevelop and expand the 87-year-old hospital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Dr Joseph Lui, director of medical services at Caritas, said the hospital will remain a Catholic institution, upholding its religious values and mission to serve the local community and the needy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Dr Kenneth Tsang, CEO of Parkway, said new services at the hospital will focus on meeting the needs of the growing elderly population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because the community, not just for Sham Shui Po but for the whole of Hong Kong, is becoming more and more of an elderly population. More than 20 percent of our population is elderly," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So the focus of the hospital will really be on what the people of Hong Kong need. The 20 percent of people who are old, they may have eye problems, they may have ear problems, they may have problems related to the deterioration of age. So those are all the areas that we're going to focus on in the hospital."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The hospital was established by the Sisters of the Precious Blood during the Second World War to provide medical care to the sick and injured.
