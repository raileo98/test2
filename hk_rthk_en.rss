<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians engaged in a dialogue with their counterparts from Macau on the second day of their visit to the gaming hub on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eight gold medallists from the Paris Games, including table tennis star Ma Long, diver Quan Hongchan, swimmer Pan Zhanle and gymnast Liu Yang, sat down for a sharing session with elite athletes from the SAR at the Olympic Sports Centre in Taipa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They discussed how to deal with pressure and injuries during the exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan, who refreshed his own 100m freestyle world record en route to victory in Paris, revealed his ambition to further improve his time and "let the world see the limit of human kind".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes then took part in a brief game of table tennis, followed by a gymnastics demonstration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a banquet at the Wynn Palace hotel on Saturday night, Macau chief executive Ho Iat-seng expressed his gratitude to the delegation, and urged teenagers to learn from the role models on how to persevere and love the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team's packed schedule continues with a gala show at the Macau East Asian Games Dome on Sunday night, before wrapping up their visit on Monday with a community event.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg Polin was among the dead. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768587_1_20240901131540.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages in Gaza, including that of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, US President Joe Biden said late on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas," Biden said in a statement issued by the White House. "I am devastated and outraged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that the bodies of Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino had been brought to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial estimation, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them," military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas and its armed wing did not immediately comment on the accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 40,691 Palestinians have been killed and 94,060 injured in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, the enclave's health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war was triggered when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, clashes broke out between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters in the occupied West Bank as Israel pushed ahead with a military operation in the flashpoint city of Jenin. Hundreds of Israeli troops have been carrying out raids since Wednesday in one of their largest actions in the West Bank in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goldberg-Polin, captured at a music festival near Gaza, appeared in a video released by Hamas in late April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world," Biden said. His parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, "have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express," the president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden vowed that "Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement, "I strongly condemn Hamas’ continued brutality, and so must the entire world. Harris, the Democratic candidate running to succeed Biden, said she and he would never waver in their commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden said he was "still optimistic," about a ceasefire deal to stop the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're on the verge of having an agreement," he said. "It's time this war ended."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden added that "people are continuing to meet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think we can close the deal, they’ve all said they agree on the principles." (Reuters)

    Rapper Fatman Scoop dies after collapsing on stage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Fatman Scoop has died, his family and manager announced on Saturday, after the 53-year-old artist suffered a medical emergency while performing on stage, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of hip-hop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scoop, best known for the hit tracks "Be Faithful" and "It Takes Scoop," collapsed on stage at Hamden Town Center Park, Connecticut and was taken to hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical staff apparently attempted to administer CPR while he was still on the stage, according to a video of the incident obtained by celebrity news site TMZ. He was then carried away on a stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a post on his Instagram account, his family wrote that "it is with profound sadness and very heavy hearts that we share news of the passing of the legendary and iconic Fatman Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fatman Scoop was known to the world as the undisputed voice of the club. His music made us dance and embrace life with positivity," they wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scoop's manager Birch Michael confirmed his death on Facebook, writing: "I love you Scoop. Thank you so much for everything you gave to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hip-hop star Missy Elliott wrote on X that Scoop's "voice and energy have contributed to many songs that made the people feel happy and want to dance for over two decades. Your impact is huge and will be never be forgotten."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Radio host Shelley Wade posted a photograph of herself with Scoop, writing: "We are losing too many of our hip-hop legends too soon. Rest easy, Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scoop briefly became embroiled in a political row in Australia in 2018 when the country's then-prime minister Scott Morrison posted a clip that featured his hit "Be Faithful."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morrison, a conservative evangelical Christian, deleted the post after his critics said the entertainer's lyrics were inappropriate and unparliamentary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's quite clear that that is not a song on my playlist," he later told reporters in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The uproar prompted a response from Scoop, who tagged Morrison in an Instagram post saying: "I am humbled to have my voice rocking in the highest offices of the Australian Government!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rapper defended his lyrics: "It's a fun PARTY SONG that has no NEGATIVITY or HARM in it!!" before extending Morrison a backstage invite to a festival appearance in Australia. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan believes there is potential for Hong Kong to handle more Australian imports.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong has what it takes to be a regional processing hub for Australian exports, ahead of his five-day duty visit down under.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The financial chief departed for Sydney on Sunday. He will also visit Melbourne before returning to the SAR on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said he hopes to achieve three objectives in his latest trip, with luring investment being top of his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the highlights of this visit is to meet enterprises in the fields of biomedicine, new energy and fintech, and I will promote Hong Kong's strategic advantages and hopefully get them to set up shop in the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similarly, Chan also hoped to strengthen cooperation in green technology, citing his goal to develop Hong Kong into a "green finance centre" under this year's Budget.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also noted that Hong Kong imported HK$14.8 billion worth of Australian goods last year, including fresh produce, seafood and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia is now the city's second-largest source of imported wine by value, and the largest by volume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's highly interconnected and accessible air freight network, well-developed storage facilities and efficient customs clearance have made it a cost-effective transshipment hub for high-value goods," Chan explained, adding there is potential to further boost trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from meeting local business leaders, Chan will also attend an Asia Summit organised by the Australian Financial Review, and deliver a keynote speech.

    HK needs to beef up tech investment: Sun Dong

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong still has a long way to go before it can become a Silicon-Valley-style international technology hub, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said the SAR has rolled out measures to boost the sector over the past two years, noting that the target of attracting 100 I&T enterprises to the territory within five years has been achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said there’s room to further boost investment in cutting-edge technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Hong Kong] government is investing more money on frontier technologies. Last year, it spent 1.07 percent of GDP on this, which is a record for Hong Kong. However, this is still low compared to nearby regions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, the mainland spends 2.7 to 2.8 percent of its GDP on research and technology. Cities like Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai spend even more, over 5 percent of their GDP."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the government needs to consider how to make the most out of its investments given the current financial climate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech chief also highlighted the need for the SAR to enhance its role as a super connector and super value-adder to lure more global talent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities said people who're caught feeding wild pigeons will no longer get any verbal warning and will instead face immediate, on-the-spot fines of HK$5,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said pigeon feeders will face instant enforcement measures, after an amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law came into effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Amendment Ordinance has already been in effect for a month," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enforcement officers will take immediate enforcement action without prior verbal warnings upon discovering any person who is found to be illegally feeding wild animals or feral pigeons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by the Legislative Council in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has also been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD noted that officers will step up patrols across the territory, and work closely with other department to conduct joint enforcement operations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's exports rose an 11th straight month in August, but the pace of growth was weaker than the previous month and market expectations as demand for computer chips slowed, while auto sales remained sluggish.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overseas sales by Asia's fourth-largest economy rose 11.4 percent year-on-year to US$57.90 billion, trade data showed on Sunday, slowing from a gain of 13.9 percent in the previous month, which was the fastest in six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also weaker than an 13 percent increase tipped in a Reuters survey of economists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Growth in semiconductor exports slowed to a five-month low, while auto sales fell for a third consecutive month due to temporary factors, such as wage negotiations and factory suspensions to improve production lines at some firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By destination, exports to China rose at a slower pace, but growth in US-bound shipments quickened. Exports to the European Union snapped a six-month run of declines and surged 16.1 percent to a record high of US$6.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, exports are heading towards a record-high performance this year, trade minister Ahn Duk-geun said. "Growing trends are seen across major export markets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports rose 6.0 percent in August to US$54.07 billion, after a 10.5 percent jump in July, which was the steepest since September 2022. It was slightly lower than a gain of 6.3 percent expected by economists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, the country posted a trade surplus of US$3.83 billion in August, wider than the previous month's US$3.60 billion. (Reuters)

   SAR players were dominant in badminton, with Tokyo bronze medallist Daniel Chan comfortably topping his group by beating rivals from Chile and Malaysia in the men's WH2 event. He next takes on South Korea's Yu Sooyoung in the semi-final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My performance today was okay. But the wind conditions had shifted 180 degrees from yesterday, the tailwind became headwinds and vice versa," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So at first, I wasn't very focused initially, and my opponent took the initiative. But I adjusted, and got guidance from my coach to regain control of the match. "

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for next year's Oasis reunion tour sold out by Saturday evening though fans eager to see the band play live for the first time in 16 years complained of technical issues and long online waits that often ended in disappointment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fans trying to access the three websites selling the tickets – Ticketmaster, See Tickets and Gigsandtours – reported issues including error messages and being kicked off before they could purchase tickets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was expected that more than a million tickets for the band's gigs would sell out within minutes. Instead, the band announced all the tickets in Britain had been sold 10 hours later after many fans had spent the day in online queues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has got to be a fairer, simpler, more efficient way of selling tickets," said Dan Walker, the British TV presenter, on X. "In the queue, out of the queue, refresh / don’t refresh, wait in line, back of the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticketmaster earlier said its website has not crashed and the queue was moving along as fans bought tickets. Gigsandtours thanked people for their patience and said there had been "extremely high demand".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, some tickets were relisted on resale sites such as Viagogo for as much as US$10,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oasis announced 17 shows in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with the first due to take place in Cardiff in July 2025, followed by nights in Manchester – where the band was formed in 1991 – London, Edinburgh and Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group, whose debut album "Definitely Maybe" was released 30 years ago, split in 2009 when lead guitarist and main songwriter Noel Gallagher said he could no longer work with his younger brother, Liam, the band's main singer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At its peak in the 1990s, Oasis exemplified the soaring appeal of Britpop, with hits like "Wonderwall," "Live Forever" and "Champagne Supernova". But Noel and Liam were often in conflict and their strained relationship finally snapped in 2009 as they prepared to play a Paris gig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since their split, both brothers have continued their musical careers, but always against the backdrop of calls from fans for the band to reunite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gigs are expected to provide a multi-million dollar boost for Britain and Ireland's hospitality sectors. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Erling Haaland terrorises the West Ham defence again as City take top spot in the Premier League. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768543_1_20240901033649.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland's second successive hat-trick earned Premier League champions Manchester City a 3-1 win at West Ham United on Saturday, while Everton suffered a painful 3-2 home loss to Bournemouth and Aston Villa returned to winning ways as goals by Amadou Onana and Jhon Duran secured a 2-1 victory at Leicester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  City opened up an early two-point lead over last season's runners-up Arsenal, with Haaland following up last week's treble against Ipswich Town to record his seventh goal in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian calmly slotted past Alphonse Areola to put City ahead and, after West Ham equalised against the run of play through Ruben Dias' own goal, Haaland restored City's lead on the half-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland secured the win with another cool finish in the 83rd minute, charging on to Matheus Nunes' through ball and lifting his shot over substitute keeper Lukasz Fabianski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We played really well, it was an unfortunate goal against," City boss Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports. "The second half was more open but we controlled it better and the performance is good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Officially, the pre-season is now over. We played one game a week and it was a super season. Now they play two a week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton, under pressure after two league losses, opened up a 2-0 lead over Bournemouth in a seven-minute spell after the break through goals from Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth spent most of the game on the back foot, but with three minutes left they pulled a goal back when Antoine Semenyo poked home from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In added time, Lewis Cook's powerful header found the back of the net and Luis Sinisterra broke Everton hearts with the winner to leave the hosts rooted to the bottom of the table, booed by their own supporters at full time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After leading 2-0 goals until the 87th minute, Everton's defeat was the latest a team has ever been two or more goals ahead in a Premier League game they have gone on to lose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really let ourselves down in front of our fans," Everton captain Seamus Coleman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa's summer signing Onana touched in from close range after a clever free kick routine in the 28th minute to give his side the lead against Leicester. Hosts Leicester were more of a threat in the second half but Duran's 63rd-minute header proved decisive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford shrugged off the loss of star striker Ivan Toney as Bryan Mbeumo's double and a goal by Yoane Wissa earned a comfortable 3-1 home win over promoted Southampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow promoted side Ipswich Town were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Fulham and Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers played out a 1-1 draw at the City Ground. (Reuters)

 Seven people, including a six-year-old and 16-year-old, were killed when a bus overturned east of Vicksburg, Mississippi, early Saturday, Warren County Coroner Doug Huskey said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two young victims were siblings, according to the coroner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mississippi Highway Patrol said the incident took place around 12:40 a.m. on Interstate 20 near Bovina in Warren County when a 2018 Volvo commercial passenger bus traveling westbound left the roadway and overturned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-seven passengers were transported to different hospitals with unknown injuries, the agency said. It said the co-driver was not transported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anytime you have people injured or killed, it's tragic but when you have a situation like this where you have multiple fatalities and multiple injuries, it makes it even worse," Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace told an ABC affiliate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huskey said most of the passengers on the bus were Latin American. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China's badminton and boccia players closed in on medals at the Paris Paralympics late on Saturday, though two swimming finalists missed out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In badminton, Daniel Chan, a bronze medalist in Tokyo, will take on South Korea's Yu Sooyoung in the semi-final of the men's WH2 on Sunday after comfortably topping his group by beating rivals from Chile and Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chu Man-kai, the top seed in the men's SH6 competition after taking silver in Tokyo, won all three pool games to earn himself a bye through the quarter-finals. He beat opponents from Britain, India and Indonesia to top Group A, and will go again in tonight's semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two women's boccia players also secured semi-final places in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After topping her group in the women's individual BC4, Annie Cheung took control of her quarter-final, beating Laissa Polyana Teixeira of Brazil 4-1. Cheung is at her first Paralympics and next takes on  Malaysia's Noor Askuzaimey Mat Salim in the semi-final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Yuen-kei had to come from behind to win her BC3 quarter-final against Kla-Han Ladamanee of Thailand, scoring twice in the final end to seal a 3-2 victory. She next faces Kang Sunhee for a place in the final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmers Tang Wai-lok and Andy Cheung missed out in the final of the men's  S14 200m freestyle, as Britain's William Ellard smashed the world record to take gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who won gold in the same event in the Rio 2016 Games, finished seventh while Cheung, who is making his Paralympic debut at the age of 19, finished eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ellard dominated from start to finish, taking more than a second off the record with a time of 1min 51.30 seconds. Nicholas Bennett of Canada and Australia's Jack Ireland took silver and bronze respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's Chan Yui-lam and Cheung Ho-ying bowed out in the semi-finals of the equivalent women's event. The S14 category is for swimmers with intellectual disabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang will be back in action in the S14 100m backstroke and the SM14 200m medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's sole para athletics representative, Yam Kwok-fan, missed out on a place in the final of the women's T36 200 metres, finishing fifth in her heat. She's got the 100m coming up later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in boccia, Hong Kong's Leung Yuk-wing saw his campaign end at the quarter-final stage in the men's individual BC4 event. After finishing second in his group, he was beaten 6-1 by Britain's Stephen McGuire in the early hours of Sunday. He'll be back later in the mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BC2 competition, Yeung Hiu-lam was beaten by Britain's Claire Taggart 3-2 in the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Sunday, John Loung of Hong Kong takes on Huadpradit Witsanu of Thailand in men's BC1 quarter-final.

    Rice sees red as Brighton halt Arsenal run

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Declan Rice pleads his case after being shown a second yellow card. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768526_1_20240831222017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton and Hove Albion ended Arsenal's winning start to the new Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at The Emirates on Saturday, with the home side holding on with 10 men after Declan Rice's second-half sending off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Arsenal dominated the first half and deservedly lead at half time after Kai Havertz finished brilliantly in the 38th minute, having been played in expertly by Bukayo Saka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes into the second half, however, Arsenal's task was made all the harder when Rice was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Brazilian striker Joao Pedro fired Brighton level 12 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides missed golden chances to win the contest late on, but they each had to settle for a point that keeps Arsenal and Brighton unbeaten from their three games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After narrowly missing out on their first Premier League title since 2004 last season, Arsenal started the new term in perfect fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With champions Manchester City also coming into this weekend's fixtures with two wins from two at the start of the new season, Arsenal know any slip-up, even this early in the campaign, could be costly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They appeared set to be course for a ninth successive league victory after a dominant first-half display. Skipper Martin Odegaard should have scored earlier in the opening period before Havertz lofted home his second of the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rice's second yellow for trying to stop Brighton taking a quick free kick, a decision that was met with consternation around the stands, turned the tide in the visitors' favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Boxing Day 2019 – Mikel Arteta's first game in charge of Arsenal – the Gunners have been shown 16 red cards in the Premier League, at least three more than any other side. But it was Rice's first red in his 245th Premier League appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following his last-gasp winner against Manchester United last weekend, Pedro reacted first after Yankuba Minteh's shot had been saved to pull Brighton level, and the game opened up thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saka could have snatched the win late on, while Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya had to be at his best on several occasions to keep Brighton from earning all three points, but both seemed content with a draw after an exhilarating tussle. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The national security police said on Saturday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention" in relation to a suicide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 41-year-old male suspect had allegedly put memorial light boxes in various places, while a 28-year-old woman is suspected of publishing falsified last words of the deceased.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said the contents provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers holding a court warrant searched the duo's homes in Kowloon and the New Territories yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They seized light boxes, materials for making the boxes and electronic communication devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were detained for investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay flight heading to Hong Kong from Kaohsiung remained grounded just before take-off after one of the aircraft's engines reportedly caught fire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline said the CX431 flight was scheduled to depart at 11.20 am on Saturday, but one of its engines encountered technical problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online videos showed that the flight was preparing for take off on the tarmac, when the engine suddenly shot out of flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A loud bang was heard, and the aircraft later came to a halt on the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline said no passengers or crew were hurt in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay apologised for causing an inconvenience and said it had arranged other flights for the affected passengers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Members of the national team on Saturday said their goodbyes to Hong Kong, saying they were delighted to meet the crowds and were surprised by their enthusiastic reactions, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meeting the press before their departure, weightlifter Li Fabin, who also visited Hong Kong with a delegation three years ago, shared his thoughts on the visit this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time there weren't that many crowds because of the pandemic…This time in Hong Kong, people have been incredibly enthusiastic, something I haven't seen before. The cheers and applause from the Hong Kong residents have deeply touched our hearts and are a strong source of support for us," the two-time Olympic gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also mentioned that he plans to defend his men’s 61 kg title at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving queen Quan Hongchan was asked about her secret to success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “it's all about staying calm, happy, and not overthinking," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha from the table tennis team visited the Hong Kong Sports Institute on Friday. She said she's thrilled to have had the chance to exchange and interact with Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel like Hong Kong’s overall table tennis standard has improved a lot. From my visit to the Sports Institute yesterday, whether in terms of training equipment or the logistical support, I think it’s getting better. I hope that we can all work hard together for the common goal of fighting for the country,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Synchronised swimmer Wang Qianyi and her elder twin sister Wang Liuyi will pursue PhD degrees at the Education University of Hong Kong in the coming academic year. She said they were looking forward to studying in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've always wanted to experience the campus atmosphere. We hope to enhance ourselves while enjoying the campus life and experiencing different aspects of life beyond training," Wang Qianyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday afternoon, the delegation left Hong Kong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, headed to Macau for a three-day visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official Facebook, Chief Executive John Lee thanked the delegation for bringing an unforgettable experience to Hongkongers and filling the city with a strong sports atmosphere in the past three days.

    Unions make appeals ahead of Policy Address

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768482_1_20240831143201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Various workers' rights groups on Saturday have submitted a series of proposals to Chief Executive John Lee for his third Police Address in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suggestions include calls for standard working hours, higher minimum wage, universal retirement protection, and improved occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the organisations, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, urged the government to review a scheme that reimburse medical expenses for employees injured at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Up to now, the medical expenses [reimbursement] depends on the fee of the public hospital. So that the injured worker only can take back HK$300 per day for their medical expenses for treatment. We think that this amount is not enough for their treatment and recovery,” said Lam Ching Yee, the association’s organiser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also called for the cost of imaging examination services, such as X-ray scans, CT scans, and MRI scans, at private clinics to be covered, allowing injured workers to quickly find out their treatment options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, unionists representing property management and security guards urged the government to promote a standard working week of 44 hours and raise the minimum wage to no less than HK$56 per hour. They added that security guards are overworked while receiving wages that are not livable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A carer concern group called for changes to the Social Welfare Department's caregiver allowance, suggesting to eliminate the eligibility review mechanism, lower application thresholds, and allow caregivers to receive the allowance in their own name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many groups also pointed to the need for a universal retirement protection scheme, advocating for a tripartite contribution model where the government, large businesses, and individual employees all contribute to the pension system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Saturday entertained cheering crowds in Hong Kong by putting on spectacular sporting displays, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Divers and swimmers headed to Victoria Park swimming pool, with synchronised swimming twins Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi kicking off the ticket-only demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those taking a dive into the pool was fan favourite Quan Hongchan, who received roaring cheers. The 17-year-old won the women's individual and synchronised 10m platform competitions at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan, who brought along her famous collection of turtle toys, introduced herself to the audience in Cantonese and ended the post-demonstration interview with a signature blessing: " Kung hei fat choy!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow diver Chen Yiwen, who won two golds at the Paris Olympics, also climbed the steps to the springboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is interesting to be able to showcase diving in such way. It's not as serious as in competitions," Chen said. "We perform in an entertaining way, and we also interact with everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations at the pool later turned cheeky with a series of wacky dives and fun leaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai, athletes from land-based disciplines wowed spectators with showcases of gymnastics, badminton and table tennis, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton mixed doubles champions Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong demonstrated some techniques alongside women's doubles duo Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan, with the latter pair also trading partners with the SAR's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam for a showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To add some more fun, Sheng Lihao, who won in the men's 10m air rifle in Paris, also took a shot in badminton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team's clean sweep of gold medals in table tennis did not go unnoticed at the stadium amid loud applause from the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lucky spectator was picked to play against ping pong legend Ma Long, with women's singles champion Chen Meng guiding her, hand in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd also caught a glimpse of the breakdancing scene from bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, also known as "671".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rounding up the demonstrations in Wan Chai was a video speech from Hong Kong's sole two-time Olympic gold medallist, Edgar Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be able to appreciate the grace of so many world number ones at such a close distance is really a rare thing. It's pity that I am not in Hong Kong, so I can't be here in person to participate in this event," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's events marked the end of a visit by the national team to Hong Kong, which next heads to neighbouring Macau.

    Talent Scheme focus is on abilities: Chris Sun

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour minister said on Saturday that the focus remains on the abilities as well as the perspectives of imported talents, instead of their nationalities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 95 per cent of those coming to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme are from the mainland, but Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun emphasised that it does not make the scheme any less international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, the minister pointed out that most of the talents coming from Category C of the scheme - full time bachelor's degree graduates in the past five years with less than three years of work experience - attained their degrees from universities in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While they may be from the mainland, they received their higher education in America. Obviously, they have a more international perspective. With these people in Hong Kong, I am sure they are going to bring benefits and will add value to our economy," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of talents is expected to apply for a visa renewal as soon as early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the bureau is still conducting a review of the scheme, which was rolled out in 2022, it still plans to diversify its pool of overseas talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said that Malaysia will be the authorities' first destination in Southeast Asia, citing the compatibility with the ethnic Chinese community there who are mostly trilingual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Sun added that the government has approved 21,000 applications for the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed that if the shortage of local labour forces is alleviated, the authority will "definitely" reduce its quotas for imported labour.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As the new school year begins on Monday, a psychologist is urging parents to pay attention to their children's emotional, physiological and behavioural well-being.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheryl So, a senior clinical psychologist at Kwai Chung Hospital, stressed that students of different ages face different forms of stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While pre-schoolers struggle to leave their comfort zones and adapt to unfamiliar environments, primary and secondary school students are expected to learn to be independent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents are advised to look out for signs of potential problems such as depression, extreme mood swings, headaches, stomachaches, prolonged sleep disturbances, fear of separation from family or excessive self-criticism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If such symptoms persist for more than a month, they should seek professional help," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that teachers and parents can play different roles depending on the developmental stage of their students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like for kindergarten, for parents, I think the first day of school is better to give them a very positive goodbye. They have to leave familiar people. They have to go to some uncharted area, that is, school," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For more than two decades, the hospital has worked with the education sector and charities to raise awareness of mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 16,000 students from over 100 schools have taken part in programmes that facilitate interaction with people who have recovered from mental health problems, with the aim of combating stigma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We provide some talk on common mental health issues students will face. And then we'll also teach them some stress management, emotion regulation skills. We also provide some workshops to train them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How to deal with mental health issues... how to interact with a person in recovery... so through the contact with them, they will realize mental illness is not that horrible. And they will have a more accurate understanding of mental illness and better experience with people in recovery."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen kept up the momentum from her victory in Paris with a cathartic win over Germany's Jule Niemeier at the US Open on Friday, while another Chinese woman, Wang Yafan, put out three-time Flushing Meadow finalist Victoria Azarenka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng breezed to a 6-2, 6-1 third round win over Jule Niemeier of Germany in 1 hour and 21 minutes,  exacting a bit of revenge on Niemeier, who eliminated her in this tournament in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I remember that match so clear," Zheng said. "I lost that match at midnight – it was a tough match and really painful. I remember I sat one hour in (the US Open site) at, I don't know, 3 o'clock, there crying by myself alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So today when I play against her, since the beginning I'm really focused, because I don't want that feeling to happen again to me. I'm glad I'm the winner today so I don't have to cry!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng next takes on Donna Vekic of Croatia on Sunday in a repeat of the Paris Games final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Wang recorded a 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 win over twentieth-seeded Azarenka to set up a fourth round tie against Paula Badosa, the 26th seed from Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Coco Gauff continued in her pursuit of recording back-to-back US Open titles by rallying to a 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Elina Svitolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Gauff overcame a mistake-filled first set by saving five of seven break points against the 27th-seeded Svitolina of Ukraine. The highlight of the match came in the third set when Gauff outlasted Svitolina during a fierce 37-stroke exchange that ended when the latter's backhand sailed wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She's a fighter," the 20-year-old Gauff said of Svitolina, a three-time major semifinalist. "I knew I had to play my best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff hopes to give the fans a thrill on Sunday when she vies for a spot in the quarterfinals against 13th-seeded Emma Navarro, who posted a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over 19th-seeded Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine. (Reuters/RTHK)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street stocks ended the day higher ahead of a long weekend. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768428_1_20240831043216.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose and the Dow scored a second consecutive all-time closing high on Friday, with Tesla and Amazon climbing after fresh US economic data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates modestly in September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US consumer spending increased solidly in July, suggesting the economy remained strong while prices rose moderately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are seeing another sign of being in a soft landing," said Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at Newedge Wealth. "It's another one of those Goldilocks kind of reports really threading a needle right down the centre. The market is really getting exactly what it wanted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "just-right" Goldilocks economy has steady growth, but not too much that it fuels excessive inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon.com and Tesla each jumped over 3 percent. Broadcom rallied nearly 4 percent, while Marvell Technology surged 9 percent after the chipmaker forecast quarterly results above estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's personal consumption expenditures report was the last major economic data release before the Fed's September meeting. Chair Jerome Powell last week expressed support for an imminent policy adjustment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Money markets suggest traders mostly expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, with odds of a 50 basis point cut dimming further after Friday's data, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday ended a tumultuous month on Wall Street after signs of a sudden moderation in the labour market in early August sparked fears of a US recession. The influence of the Japanese yen carry trade worsened the rout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares have rebounded since then, with the S&P 500 trading near record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.01 percent to end at 5,648 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.13 percent to 17,714 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.55 percent to 41,563 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the month, the S&P 500 rose 2.3 percent, the Dow added 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia rose 1.5 percent, rebounding from a 6.4 percent drop on Thursday after the artificial intelligence-chip bellwether failed to match sky-high investor expectations, despite upbeat results and a broadly in-line forecast. (Reuters)

    Brazilian judge orders X shutdown

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian Supreme Court justice ordered on Friday the "immediately suspension" of social media platform X in the country, after a court-imposed deadline expired for the company to identify a legal representative in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is the latest chapter in an ongoing feud between Justice Alexandre de Moraes and Elon Musk, which also included the freezing of the satellite internet provider Starlink's financial accounts in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the decision, Moraes ordered the full and immediate suspension of X in the country until all related court orders on X were complied with, including the payment of fines amounting 18.5 million reais (US$3.28 million) and the nomination of a legal representative in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moraes ordered telecomunications regulator Anatel to implement the suspension order, and to confirm to the court within 24 hours that it has carried it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a bid to avoid the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent the blockage, Moraes said that individuals or companies who tried to keep access to the social network that way could be fined up to 50,000 reais a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  X said late on Thursday that it expected Moraes to order a shutdown "soon. Earlier this year, Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts implicated in probes of so-called digital militias accused of spreading distorted news and hate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk, denouncing the order as censorship, responded by closing the platform's offices in Brazil. X, formerly known as Twitter, said at the time that its services would still be available in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid the underlying feud over X, Brazil's Supreme Court also blocked the local bank accounts of the Starlink satellite internet firm, which is 40 percent owned by Musk, leading the company on Friday to ask the court to suspend that decision. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed Ukraine's Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk on Friday, according to a presidential decree.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The dismissal was announced just a day after the Ukrainian military reported that an F-16 jet crashed and its pilot died while repelling a major Russian strike on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have decided to replace the commander of the Air Forces... I am eternally grateful to all our military pilots," President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his evening address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not give a reason for dismissal but mentioned that personnel must be protected, and that there was a need to strengthen the command level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's General Staff said that General Lieutenant Anatoliy Kryvonozhka would temporarily perform the duties of commander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian military did not provide a reason for Monday's crash but said the jet came down while it was approaching a Russian target. Oleshchuk said on Monday partners from the US were helping to investigate the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US defence official said that the crash did not appear to be the result of Russian fire, and possible causes from pilot error to mechanical failure were still being investigated. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China teenager Jasmine Ng placed sixth in her women's 200 metres medley SM6 final at the Paris Paralympics on Friday, with British world record holder Maisie Summers-Newton taking gold far ahead of the field.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu Daomin took bronze for the national team while Ellie Marks of the United States won the silver medal, albeit more than five seconds behind Summers-Newton, who went close to her own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who is taking on three events at the Games at the age of just 14, finished in 3mins, 11.95 seconds. She'd qualified fifith fastest for the final. She's next in action late on Sunday in the 100m breaststroke SB6 final and has the 100m backstroke event to come later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SM6 category denotes medley swimming races for athletes with a number of different types of disability including short stature, major limb impairment or loss in two limbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, boccia athlete Annie Cheung Yuen made it a clean sweep in group play, beating Phonsila Nuanchan of Thailand 5-2. After topping Pool C in the women's BC4 event, she takes on Brazilian Polyana Teixeira in the quarter finals on Sunday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Archer Wilson Ngai, however, went out in the round of 32, losing to Jere Forsberg of Finland, 142-137.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the national team, Hong Yang added a third swimming medal of the Games for China as he won the 200m individual medley SM6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Zhou Xia won China's first gold medal of the athletics events when she sprinted to the women's T35 100m title, for people with impaired coordination, in a time of 13.58sec. (additional reporting by AFP)

    Govt condemns remarks against Stand News verdict

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says relevant reports and articles by Stand News were not based on facts. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768396_1_20240830211335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday strongly condemned untruthful remarks smearing the freedom of press in Hong Kong, after former editors of the now-defunct Stand News were convicted of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in a statement, the authorities said officials from the United States and Western countries, anti-China organisations and some foreign media had made "untruthful and purely political" remarks regarding the judgment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said freedom of the press is protected under Hong Kong law, but it stressed that reporters must follow the principle of "responsible journalism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like all other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. Journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticising government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law," it wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the media and relevant personnel publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security or public order, or of public health or morals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities pointed out that the District Court had said the relevant reports and articles by Stand News were not based on facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reasons for verdict have also pointed out clearly that the ideology of Stand News was localism which excluded China, and that it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government during the 'anti-extradition amendment bill incidents'," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government added that the United States and Western countries had "double standards", as these countries have carried out enforcement actions against the dissemination of disinformation and incitement of hatred.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation chief said on Friday that mpox vaccines were set to arrive in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the next few days to fight a new strain of the virus.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We hope to have the first delivery in the next few days, and then it will build up," Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at a media conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 230,000 mpox doses are immediately available to be dispatched, added WHO official Tim Nguyen. These doses were donated by the European Commission and Danish mpox vaccine manufacturer Bavarian Nordic, Nguyen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO has said that its partners can start buying mpox vaccines before they are approved by the UN health agency, lifting its usual rules in a bid to get inoculations to Africa faster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is currently reviewing applications for emergency licences for two vaccines made by Bavarian Nordic and Japan's KM Biologics. Tedros said these were expected to be granted in the next two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rosamund Lewis, the WHO technical lead for mpox, said she hoped the vaccines and other interventions by health partners would help cases come down again in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An mpox diagnostic manufacturer also expressed interest in securing WHO's emergency use listing for their kit a day after the agency opened the process, Tedros said without naming the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighbouring countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 18,000 suspected cases of mpox have been reported in Congo so far this year with 629 deaths, while over 150 cases have also been confirmed in Burundi, Tedros said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Friday showed off some of their skills and shared insights and stories from the Paris Games at an evening gala.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium was one of the events where local fans could interact with the competitors during their three-day visit to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening of the show, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong residents had been looking forward to meeting the elite athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the Olympics, Hong Kong had a fiery atmosphere for the Games, and residents watched free broadcasts through the night to support the mainland and SAR athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From watching the broadcast from ten thousand miles away, to seeing the athletes first-hand, I believe everyone is excited and looking forward to the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes shared positive vibes with Hong Kong fans, and showcased their skills at the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I, of course, have to play for my country on the court, but in life, I think we need to chill out, and be happy. I hope everyone can spend every day happily," table tennis player Sun Yingsha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shuttler Zheng Siwei said he missed his usual mixed doubles teammate Huang Yaqiong after being assigned a new partner. However, he was happy to be reunited with Huang at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People only cherish something after losing it. I believe everyone’s experienced this before. Please cherish the one who fights alongside with you and the one who accompanies you," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some mainland athletes, such as table tennis player Fan Zhendong and diver Quan Hongchan, used Cantonese to greet the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few SAR Olympians, such as gold medal fencer Vivian Kong, and shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet, were also at the stadium and shared their experiences with the audience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday said it has fined WeChat Pay Hong Kong for failing to prevent risks associated with the financing of terrorism and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following an investigation, the digital wallet service provider was ordered to pay a penalty of HK$875,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said WeChat Pay Hong Kong does not have a robust system for conducting customer due diligence reviews upon incidents that pose a risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA executive director Raymond Chan urged mobile wallet service operators to strengthen their due diligence procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVF (Stored Value Facilities) licensees should apply enhanced due diligence measures on their customers in situations involving potentially high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing," Chan said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These enhanced due diligence measures should be effective in ensuring that the associated money laundering and terrorist financing risks are properly managed."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kwan Wing-fai's company cooperates with the Hong Kong Blind Union to train visually impaired persons to become badminton racket stringers. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768351_1_20240830165654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Social Workers Association (HKSWA) on Friday urged local employers to recruit more disabled people when considering their hiring needs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the number of disabled people who had attained a bachelor's degree from eight UGC-funded universities tripled to around 1,500 in the academic year spanning 2023 to 2024, compared to four years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKSWA recommended that companies be given training before hiring people with disabilities, so they can be assigned tasks according to their strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athena Ng, who is visually impaired, said she was worried about communicating with her peers in the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people rely on visuals on when they communicate. For example, they would point at a particular object when referring to it. But the visually impaired are unable to [do that], leading to communication issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng now works for a product development company that cooperates with the Hong Kong Blind Union to train the disabled as badminton racket stringers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Kwan Wing-fai revealed his company has employed four disabled persons - all but one suffered from hearing difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was concerned about their working abilities to begin with, but he found these worries were unfounded as they performed even better than able-bodied people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They completed the project on time and even completed it earlier than our target. I think they give me the confidence to employ the disabled again," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Kwan from the HKSWA's Professional Development Committee said many non-governmental organisations are doing a good job in supporting people with disabilities by providing them with training and counselling services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I think the government may do more, for example, the government can support NGOs, to give more resources to NGOs to promote or support enterprises to foster an inclusive culture in the business sector."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 11.8 percent in July compared to the same month last year, marking the fifth month of declines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Friday showed the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.1 billion in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slump follows a 9.7 percent drop in June and an 11.4 percent decrease in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined further in July from a year earlier amid the continued impact of the change in consumption patterns and the strong Hong Kong dollar," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More outbound travels by residents during the summer holidays was also one of the factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the government said challenges remain, but the authorities will continue to support small and medium-sized enterprises, including those in the retail industry.

    At least 6 dead after Shanshan hits Japan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Typhoon Shanshan weakened to a tropical storm on Friday, but was still dumping heavy rains as it slowly churned through Japan, triggering transport havoc and landslide warnings, with up to six people killed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The storm, which at landfall was one of the strongest to hit Japan in decades, pummelled Kyushu island on Thursday with gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before making landfall, a landslide caused by the heavy rains preceding the storm killed three members of the same family late on Tuesday in Aichi prefecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi on Friday confirmed reports of one additional death, but said that "the relation to the typhoon was being studied".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more were feared dead and two others were missing, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight people were seriously hurt and 70 others had light injuries, Hayashi said, with many injured by broken glass after the typhoon smashed windows and ripped tiles off roofs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 200 buildings were damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rapid attribution analysis issued on Friday by Imperial College London, using peer-reviewed methodology, calculated that Typhoon Shanshan's winds were made 26 percent more likely by a warming planet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without phasing out fossil fuels, the root cause of climate change, typhoons will bring even greater devastation to Japan," said Ralf Toumi, director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coming storm prompted Japanese authorities to issue their highest alert in several areas, with more than five million people advised to evacuate their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday the Japan Meteorological Agency issued alerts for possible landslides in many parts of Kyushu, and as far away as Shizuoka on the main island of Honshu, the Tokyo region and nearby Kanagawa. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Friday called on the government to encourage students from countries involved in the Belt and Road initiative to work in Hong Kong after completing their studies here.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The request is part of the university's proposals to Chief Executive John Lee for his policy address in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, the university's vice-president for research and innovation, Christopher Chao, said the government should increase subsidies and scholarships for these students, adding that the advantages of doing so extend beyond the education sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because when we are going to all these 'One Belt One Road' countries, apart from the educational part, in fact, we are also talking about a possibility of doing investment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we are talking about the investment ecosystem, we are talking about how these things can be integrated together."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chao also urged the authorities to extend the Strive and Rise programme – which pairs students from underprivileged backgrounds with volunteer mentors – to countries participating in the Belt and Road initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such a move would help children in developing nations, while enhancing the global image of Hong Kong.

    Alcaraz knocked out of US Open, Sinner advances

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alcaraz on court following his second-round defeat to Zandschulp. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768318_1_20240830131810.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Carlos Alcaraz was knocked out of the US Open on Friday, as the final Grand Slam of the year lost one of its biggest crowd-pullers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the world number three and 2022 champion in New York, was stunned by Dutch world number 74 Botic van de Zandschulp 6-1, 7-5, 6-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz had made at least the quarter-finals in his three previous appearances in New York. Thursday's defeat was his earliest at a Grand Slam since a second round exit at Wimbledon in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat ended his dream of becoming only the third man in the modern era to win the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tennis schedule is so tight. I've been playing a lot of matches lately with Roland Garros, with Wimbledon, Olympic Games," said Alcaraz who lost a draining Olympics final to Novak Djokovic in Paris just over three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I took a little break after the Olympic Games," he added. "Probably it wasn't enough. I came here with not as much energy as I thought that I was going to come. But I don't want to put that as excuse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, orld number one Jannik Sinner, vying to add the US Open title to the Australian Open crown he won in January, breezed into the third round with a 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 victory over American Alex Michelsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's Sinner needed just an hour and 39 minutes to get past the 49th-ranked Michelsen, giving himself a match point with a crisp forehand winner down the line and polishing it off with a crosscourt forehand volley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a real improvement, for sure," said the 23-year-old, who had to rally from a set and a break down in an unconvincing first-round win over Mackenzie McDonald.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm looking to get better now in the next days," said the Italian, who hit the practice court shortly after the match "trying to understand what works here best on these courts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's see what I can do in the next round," added Sinner, who next plays Australian wild card Christopher O'Connell on Saturday. (AFP)

 The government on Friday re-appointed former lawmaker Lam Tai-fai as the head of RTHK's advisory board, with his new two-year term beginning on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said five other board members were re-appointed, including media veteran Ronald Chiu and former Law Society president Thomas So.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board has provided invaluable advice to the Director of Broadcasting and assisted RTHK in fulfilling its public purposes and mission as set out in the Charter of RTHK," Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am grateful that Lam and the five incumbent members have accepted reappointment to continue serving on the Board."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also announced seven new members to the body, including City University governing council member Robert Lui, sports scholar Jim Luk, NGO chief Kitty Chau and Meggy Cheng, a top executive at a local dance academy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister thanked the outgoing members, which include lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen and Chinese University media scholar Anthony Fung, for their contributions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers had the chance to meet members of the national Olympic team on Friday, as a delegation held various meet-and-greet events on the second day of a three-day visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A group of 65 competitors from Team China are in the SAR to celebrate their success at this year's Games, after bringing home 91 medals from Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some competitors went to the Sports Institute and a school, where many aspiring athletes and students waited in anticipation to meet them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One girl, 10, came with a portrait of her favourite athletes, saying meeting them was an opportunity she could not pass up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the building next door. I was doing my summer homework when I saw the athletes coming out of the car outside my window. I told my mom to immediately take me there to meet them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I watched most of the competition that they had broadcast. As long as I can see my favourite athletes, no matter how much sacrifice or hard work, I am happy and willing to do so."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A form 1 student surnamed Ho waited outside the Sports Institute in the hope of meeting the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I can interact with them up close. I really like Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha. I started noticing Ma Long after watching the last Olympics and that inspired me to take up table tennis. I started the sport because of him," the boy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some athletes participated in a meet-and-greet event with the disciplined services at the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy to showcase their skills and interact with young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans cheered as the athletes entered the stadium in an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the exchange session, some youth representatives got to play table tennis against Ma and Fan Zhendong, who made do with a pot lid and a spatula as their paddles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said he was honoured and excited that the mainland athletes had come to Hong Kong, and praised them for their perseverance and unyielding spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My favourite is weightlifter Li Wenwen. She picked up her coach after she won gold and shouted 'We're done with work!' Wasn't that so exciting?," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The national team's perseverance, superior skillset, passionate performance and dedication to the country are all in line with Hong Kong's disciplinary forces, and also the spirit of the disciplinary forces."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation was to visit Victoria Peak and Victoria Harbour in the afternoon to take in the sights, before a gala show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will end on Saturday with sporting demonstrations in the morning for the public to enjoy, including badminton, gymnastics, table tennis, diving and swimming.

    Beijing blasts criticism of Stand News court verdict

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong says the court's decision on the now-defunct Stand News safeguards national security and the rule of law. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768297_1_20240830114245.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has hit out at statements made by the United States, Britain and the European Union after a court convicted two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called the verdict "a direct attack on media freedom", while Britain's foreign office minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West, said the SAR administration should "end politicised prosecutions of journalists and uphold press and publication freedoms" and the European Union said the ruling was "yet another sign of the dwindling space for press freedom".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said the court's decision safeguarded national security and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson also criticised the West of using press freedom as a political tool to make excuses for anti-China organisations, and smearing and attacking the rule of law in the SAR to advocate the so-called "chilling effect".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It went to say that press freedom in the territory has been better protected under a safe and stable environment following the implementation of the national security laws, and urged relevant politicians to stop harbouring criminals and interfering in the SAR's judicial and internal affairs.

    Vulnerable newborns to get dedicated care at hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The multidisciplinary team at Queen Mary Hospital. Photo Courtesy of the Hospital Authority" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768278_1_20240830085501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Mary Hospital has set up a multi-disciplinary team of professionals to look after babies born prematurely, while providing psychological and even palliative support for parents in case of emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 43-strong team comprises obstetric and paediatric healthcare professionals, clinical psychologists, and social workers. It has helped the parents of over 20 babies since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team springs into action whenever a baby is delivered between 23 and 25 weeks, the so-called periviability interval where medical intervention is often needed in order for the newborn to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to a quarter of the infants also develop severe disabilities later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading the team is Mimi Seto, an associate consultant at the hospital's Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said apart from caring for premature babies, the team also intervenes by delaying pre-term labour for expecting mothers by prescribing them medication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We use] antenatal steroid drugs to enhance the fetal lung maturity, and give them magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If needed, if [the mothers] are in pre-term labour, having regular contractions, we might also give the mother tocolytic therapy, which is a drug to stop the uterus from contracting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The logic, Seto said, is to allow the baby to receive sufficient prenatal treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she admitted tocolytic therapy may have side effects to the mother, even though it is safe most of the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some cases, the hospital also provides palliative care to parents, including counselling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seto suggested all mothers-to-be, especially those with a history of pre-term birth, to seek antenatal care as soon as their pregnancy begins and follow the advice by obstetricians.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pablo Castrillo escaped from a breakaway and held off his pursuers on the climb to the line for an emotional Vuelta a España stage win on Thursday as Ben O'Connor protected his overall lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Castrillo, a Spaniard who rides for Kern Pharma, attacked at just before the 10-kilometre climb to the finish of stage 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old celebrated his first World Tour victory, and the first by a Spaniard on this year's Vuelta, by crossing the line pointing skywards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dedicated his success to his team's founder and former president Manolo Azcona, who died during the night at the age of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought about Manolo the whole stage. I had his strength by my side in those last few kilometres," said Castrillo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I suffered a lot but to be able to win a stage in the Vuelta is just crazy," he added. "I don't have any words. I've gone to the end of my strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Castrillo finished eight seconds ahead of Max Poole after the other members of the elite escape group stopped chasing to avoid helping each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poole, a 21-year-old Briton, had been part of the breakaway the previous day when he finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor, an Australian who rides for AG2R-Decathlon maintained his 3min 16sec lead over the Slovenian from Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pack finished 6min 29sec behind Castrillo on a hilly 125.7 kilometre meander through Galicia from Ourense to the Manzaneda ski resort. (AFP)

    Root's record-equalling century revives England

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Root scored an England record-equalling 33rd Test hundred as the hosts established a strong position against Sri Lanka on the first day of the second Test at Lord's on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  England, 42-2 when Root came in to bat, reached stumps on 358-7. The star batsman made 143 – his sixth Test century at the 'Home of Cricket'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other England top-order batsman made more than Ben Duckett's 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fast bowler Gus Atkinson was 74 not out at the close – his maiden Test fifty in just his fifth match at this level – after providing Root with excellent support in a seventh-wicket stand of 92 in 19 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we have had a really good day," Root told Sky Sports. "Hopefully we can carry that on now and over 400 would be a really good total."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Root's 206-ball innings saw him equal the England record of 33 Test hundreds held by the retired Alastair Cook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to be quite patient and they bowled well for periods of time," said Root, who made his Test debut in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, all of Sri Lanka's pace trio took two wickets on Thursday, with Lahiru Kumara leading the way with 2-75 in 20 overs after being recalled in place of Vishwa Fernando following England's five-wicket win in last week's first Test at Old Trafford. (AFP)

    Real to face Liverpool in new-look Champions League

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Holders Real Madrid will face Liverpool away and host Borussia Dortmund in a repeat of last season's final in the league stage of the new-look Uefa Champions League, the draw for which took place on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Every team will play eight games against eight different opponents in the new format of Europe's elite club competition, with all 36 clubs now pooled together into one league rather than split into groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-tech draw took place in Monaco, with Cristiano Ronaldo pressing the all-important button to make a computer algorithm determine the fixtures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid, who have signed France superstar Kylian Mbappé since winning a record-extending 15th European Cup, will also notably play AC Milan at home and will go to Atalanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real beat last season's Europa League winners Atalanta in the Uefa Super Cup in Warsaw earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool, who are back in the Champions League after a one-season absence, will also notably meet Milan and take on tournament debutants Girona.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, supporters of the Anfield club will perhaps be most excited about the prospect of hosting German champions Bayer Leverkusen, coached by former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, winners of the competition in 2023, will play at home to Italian champions Inter Milan and go to both Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they were also handed more comfortable opponents including Club Brugge, Sparta Prague and Slovan Bratislava, who have never played in the modern Champions League proper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other standout head-to-heads will include Bayern Munich against both PSG and Barcelona, and Arsenal against Inter and Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of clubs in the Champions League has increased from 32 in the past, with the 36 participants split into four seeded pots of nine for the draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every team faces two teams from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. The first matches will be played on September 17, 18 and 19. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street had a mixed showing on Thursday with the Dow reaching a fresh record after economic data indicating stronger second quarter GDP growth than initially estimated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped by 0.6 percent to 41,335, while the S&P 500 was flat at 5,591.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq slipped 0.2 percent to 17,516.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The movements came on the back of data indicating the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the April to June period – revised upwards from 2.8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer spending provided a boost, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, coupled with a stabilisation in initial jobless claims, brought some relief to markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial claims slipped by 2,000 in the week ending August 24, indicating that layoffs remain low, said Oxford Economics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's record came despite a 6.4 percent slide in chip giant Nvidia's shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the AI behemoth reported quarterly sales that beat expectations on Wednesday, investors showed nervousness that the company's growth might be showing signs of normalisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, its share price was up about 160 percent year-to-date and has accounted for a third of the S&P 500's gains this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, traders will be eyeing the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge ahead of a widely anticipated start to interest rate cuts next month. (AFP)

    Israel agrees to 'pauses' in Gaza to allow polio jabs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel has agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in Gaza to allow UN health officials to administer polio vaccinations in the territory, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The way we discussed and agreed, the campaign will start on the first of September, in central Gaza, for three days, and there will be a humanitarian pause during the vaccination," said Rik Peeperkorn, the agency's representative for Palestinian territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vaccination rollout will also cover southern and northern Gaza, which will each get their own three-day pauses, Peeperkorn told reporters, adding that Israel had agreed to allow an additional day if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday night the new measures were "not a ceasefire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said it supports the "UN humanitarian truce."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and European Union have both voiced concern over polio in Gaza, after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed this month in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN agencies have said they plan to provide oral vaccines against type-2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) to more than 640,000 children in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water – an increasingly common problem in Gaza with much of the territory's infrastructure destroyed by Israel in its war against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. (AFP)

    US Army criticises Trump staff over 'push' at cemetery

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Army on Thursday took aim at Donald Trump's staff over a visit by the Republican presidential candidate to the country's most hallowed resting place for its war dead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump went to the Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington with family members of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing during the last hours of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His campaign posted photos from the visit, including one showing him giving a thumbs-up gesture while standing with relatives at the grave of one of the Marines killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Army said an Arlington employee was "abruptly pushed aside" when she sought to ensure a law prohibiting political activity or filming on cemetery grounds was followed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the (Arlington National Cemetery) employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked," an Army spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going on the offensive, Trump's campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita has described the employee as a "despicable individual," while campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said she was "clearly suffering from a mental health episode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has made criticism of President Joe Biden's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a key note of his campaign ahead of the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The withdrawal was made as part of a peace deal signed by the Trump administration with the Taliban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uproar over the incident at Arlington on Monday is the latest controversy in Trump's troubled relationship with the military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military said troops killed a Palestinian militant leader and six others on Thursday, the second day of large-scale "counter-terrorism" operations in the occupied West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A military spokesman gave an overall death toll of 16 Palestinian militants since Israeli forces launched coordinated raids across the northern West Bank on Wednesday. The Palestinian health ministry reported at least 15 dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A military statement said five were killed on Thursday in the Tulkarem refugee camp including Muhammad Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa. Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said he was its commander in the nearby Nur Shams refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, "he was a head of a terror network in Nur Shams," also accusing Jaber of "inciting" young Palestinians to carry out attacks against Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoshani told an online media briefing that Jaber was killed in "a significant exchange of fire" between Israeli forces and "armed terrorists hiding" in a mosque in the Tulkarem camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tulkarem governor Mustafa Taqatqa rejected the army's account, saying the five men were not inside the mosque when killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A rocket was fired at a house and the young men were not in the mosque," said Taqatqa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoshani said that one member of the Israeli security forces was injured in the operation that killed Jaber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military separately said it killed two "terrorists" in Jenin, also in the northern West Bank, taking its reported death toll of Palestinian militants to 16 since the raids began early on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the military, nine of them were killed on Wednesday, the first day of the simultaneous raids. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Caroline Groot of the Netherlands rode to victory to earn herself the first gold medal at this year's Paralympic Games on Thursday in the women's para cycling track C4-5 500 metres time trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The seven-time world champion finished the race in 35.566 seconds at the National Velodrome in Paris, over a second faster than silver medallist Marie Patouillet of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Dutch had broken the World and Paralympic record earlier in the day with a time of 35.390 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French cyclist finished in 36.700 seconds, while Canadian Kate O'Brien completed the podium with 36.873 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holder of the C4 category in this event, Kadeena Cox of Great Britain, fell off her bike early on, and could not finish the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The C4-5 class is for cyclists who have impairments affecting their legs, arms, and/or trunk, but still have the capability to use a standard bike.

  Karsen Kitchen, a 21-year-old senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, became the youngest woman ever to cross the Karman Line, the internationally recognised boundary marking the edge of space, 100 kilometres above the Earth's surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin's small New Shepard rocket blasted off at 8:00 am local time (1300 GMT) from the company's Launch Site One base in west Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After liftoff, the sleek and spacious capsule separated from its booster, which boasts zero carbon emissions, before the rocket performed a precise vertical landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the spaceship soared beyond the Karman Line, passengers had the chance to marvel at the Earth's curvature and unbuckle their seatbelts to float during a few minutes of weightlessness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being there in the darkness of space... there's no way to talk about how impressive that is," said Rob Ferl, a Nasa-funded researcher who conducted an experiment during the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule then reentered the atmosphere, deploying its parachutes for a desert landing near the launch site. The total flight time is typically around 10 to 11 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of its tickets, but prices are believed to vary significantly based on the individual selected, their net worth, and the social capital they bring to the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first seat sold in a 2021 charity auction went for US$28 million, but notable guests like Star Trek actor William Shatner have flown on Blue Origin flights for free. Others have reported paying several hundred thousand dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin's main competitor in the suborbital space market, Virgin Galactic, is currently on a two-year pause from commercial operations as it upgrades its fleet. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week as the US labour market remains healthy in the face of high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jobless claims ticked down by 2,000 to 231,000 for the week of August 24, the Labour Department reported on Thursday. That's just below the 232,000 new filings analysts were expecting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 4,750 to 231,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are considered a proxy for layoffs, remain low by historic standards. They have ticked up in recent months though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From January through May, claims averaged a paltry 213,000 a week. But they started rising in May, hitting 250,000 in late July and adding to evidence that high interest rates were finally cooling a red-hot US job market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits rose by 13,000 to 1.87 million for the week of August 17. (AP)

 Members of the national team arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday to celebrate their success at this year's Olympics, with a delegation including 59 competitors who were either individual champions or part of winning teams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of 65 competitors were in the SAR for a three-day visit, with events including an evening reception and banquet hosted by the Hong Kong government, followed by a gala show and sporting demonstrations in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the athletes at a banquet, Chief Executive John Lee said their visit will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to pursue careers in the sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking back, the mainland's Olympic athletes delegation has visited Hong Kong several times. Their visits not only enhance emotional exchanges of the people between the two places, but also facilitate the exchange and development of sports culture," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that this visit will further deepen the profound friendship between Hong Kong and the mainland. It will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to engage in sports careers and strive for excellence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation visiting the SAR was all-time great in table tennis, Ma Long, sporting a gold from the team event – the sixth he has won in his illustrious career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meet-the-media event, Ma said it was the fourth time he had joined a visit to Hong Kong, adding that he is always touched by the warm greetings he receives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time around, I hope to have more opportunities to communicate with the young people in Hong Kong. I think this would definitely be a special memory in my career," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After the Olympics, many people have been asking me about my future plans. As of now, I am still an athlete. Of course, if there are any changes, I will definitely let everyone know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving superstar Quan Hongchan had captured the hearts of many fans with her cute personality as she struck gold again in the women's individual 10 metres platform and the synchronised 10 metres platform with teammate Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think if you have passion, go for it. Don’t be afraid of failure. I would also like to thank everyone for liking me so much," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, swimmer Pan Zhanle, who made headlines for his world record-setting victory in the 100 metres freestyle, said he was looking forward to meeting the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will first train myself well. When I become more mature, I can then be a role model for others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team won a total of 91 medals at the Paris Games, including 40 golds, 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

    Former Stand News editors convicted of sedition

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two former editors of a now-shuttered online news outlet and its parent company have been found guilty of conspiring to publish seditious articles. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768189_1_20240829180525.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News were found guilty on Thursday of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen and acting chief editor Patrick Lam were convicted of conspiring to publish and reproduce seditious publications between July 2020 and December 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News' parent company, Best Pencil Limited, was also found guilty of the same offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written judgement, District Court judge Kwok Wai-kin ruled that 11 of the 17 publications raised by the prosecution were seditious, noting the political climate at the time was extremely heated and many people were unhappy with the SAR and central governments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The published materials included interviews with opposition figures as well as commentaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that the political ideology of Stand News was localism and its stance was to "support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the anti-extradition bill movement, it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government,” Kwok wrote in the judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that Chung knew and approved of the articles’ seditious intentions and offered Stand News as a platform to incite hatred against central and SAR authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge also noted that Lam approved one of the articles found to be seditious, while at the same time voicing support for the anti-extradition bill movement in a forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict, originally slated for last October, was postponed three times pending an appeal in a separate sedition case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing has been adjourned to September 26, and both Chung and Lam were freed on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They each face up to two years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was absent from the hearing on Thursday due to a health issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence lawyer Audrey Eu read Lam’s mitigation letter in court, which said Stand News journalists sought to run a news outlet with fully independent editorial standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Journalists are not only responsible for their own reports. They are also failing in their duty if they deliberately avoid reporting when they know the public has the right to be informed,” Eu quoted Lam as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also revealed that Lam is suffering from a “rare disease” that required chemotherapy, and it would be difficult for him to receive medical care if jailed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written mitigation letter submitted to the court, Chung said it is the “inescapable responsibility” of journalists to report the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior counsel Eu told the court that both defendants had spent over 10 months behind bars before getting bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News closed down in December 2021 after police raided its office and froze its assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the court after the verdict, chief superintendent from the national security unit, Steve Li, said police welcomed the court's decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the national security department took the enforcement against the Stand News on December 2021, some people criticised us that we are suppressing the freedom of the speech and the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the judge's verdict has clearly illustrated the necessity and the lawfulness of the enforcement [action] taken on that day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at another event, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said authorities respected and valued media freedom, which is protected by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all journalists report based on facts, I think there would not be situations restricting the freedom of the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Criticising the government is not an action that is not allowed. We see news articles criticising the government every day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late Thursday evening, a government spokesman said "any individual or organisation that incites hatred and engages in acts and activities endangering national security can never escape sanctions of the law, and such malicious acts will surely be duly punished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added, "To distort words and acts that incite hatred as 'journalistic work' as such individuals and organisations did is indeed the gravest insult against the professional journalists of Hong Kong."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A High Court jury on Thursday convicted one person and cleared six others over a plot to bomb and shoot police officers in 2019, after Hong Kong's first-ever trial involving United Nations anti-terrorism legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Chun-pong, who was 29 when he was arrested, was found guilty of conspiracy to cause explosion likely to endanger life or property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to appear in court next Monday to offer a mitigation plea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six co-defendants, Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Justin Hui and Lau Pui-ying were cleared of related charges, including conspiring to set off bombs and conspiracy to murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Cheung Chun-fu, had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of possessing explosives and firearms and was given an 18-month prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution had told the court that the bomb plot involved planting explosives in Wan Chai during a rally to mark International Human Rights Day in December 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, chief superintendent Steve Li from the national security police said he would not comment on the court's decision, but stressed the case was very serious in nature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very serious case, involving genuine firearms, explosives, and a very organised plot to kill police and other innocent people as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But as a police, I can assure that we have tried our best to protect our society."

    Labour rights group says heat protections not enough

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Survey shows workers felt unwell while working under hot weather and 40 percent of employers provided insufficient heat relief measures. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768168_1_20240829165538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour rights group, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, on Thursday said around 40 percent of employers had insufficient measures to prevent heat stroke among workers during hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association surveyed around 400 workers, mainly construction workers and cleaners, between June and August 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that nearly 50 percent of respondents had felt unwell while working under hot weather, with symptoms including dizziness and headaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also found that workers lacked sufficient rest time during hot conditions, with 40 percent of respondents saying they did not have the basic 10 to 15 minutes of rest every two hours, while nearly half did not receive extra rest during a Heat Stress at Work Warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, head of the association, said employers misunderstood the guidelines from the Labour Department, leading to workers' rest times being reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we only focus on when the heat warning is in effect, the employer needs to provide equipment or measures for cooling. But if they do that, they can reduce the rest time. This is the misleading information for us, because our calculation is we must have a basic rest time, 10 to 15 minutes, plus the extra resting time when the heat warning is in effect. I think most employers or employees do not know this information."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested the government emphasise workers' basic rest time and eliminate the "rest time reducing" approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu believed that due to a lack of legal weight behind the current guidelines, employers may not be willing to cooperate proactively with the recommendations. She hopes legislation could be enacted in future to hold employers accountable.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday met with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Beijing on the third and final day of his visit to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's commitment to the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-US relations remains unchanged," Xi said during the meeting at the Great Hall of the People.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said bilateral ties should be developed based on mutual respect, peace co-existence and win-win cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi called on Washington to work with Beijing in the same direction, and view China and its development in a positive and rational manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As two major countries, China and the United States should be responsible for history, for the people and for the world, and should be a source of stability for world peace and a propeller for common development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan said US President Joe Biden is committed to managing the relationship to avoid conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Biden is committed to responsibly managing this consequential relationship to ensure the competition does not veer in the conflict or confrontation, and to work together where our interests align," Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to maintaining high level diplomacy and till this end President Biden looks forward to engaging with you again in the coming weeks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of his visit on Tuesday, Sullivan has met with high-ranking officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. (Xinhua and agencies)

 A human resource body on Thursday said its research indicated the development and real estate sectors would need more workers in the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management based the finding on a study of 300 companies in 20 sectors between April and June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the overall workforce in Hong Kong would grow by two percent by 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute said demand for manpower in fields such as architecture, engineering, and construction was expected to grow by up to nine percent, due to major development projects such as the Northern Metropolis and Kau Yi Chau Artificial Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, technological advances would lead to fewer jobs in the retail, transportation and media sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute's president Lawrence Hung, called on the government to adjust its talent recruitment efforts accordingly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should actively listen to industry feedback, provide more proactive measures for businesses to fill vacancies, and adjust talent admission schemes based on actual circumstances to effectively attract overseas talent to supplement the local talent pool," he said in a statement.
