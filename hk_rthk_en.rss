<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tuition fees at public universities will increase by HK$2,400 next year, with further rises of around the same amount planned for each of the following two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After an almost three-decade-long freeze in annual fees, the current HK$42,100 charge for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will rise to HK$44,500 in 2025/26, HK$47,000 in 2026/27 and HK$49,500 in 2027/28 – an increase of almost 17.6 percent over the three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For sub-degree programmes, the current HK$15,040 will reach HK$17,800 by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson on Thursday said the administration is working to strike a balance between maintaining its fiscal discipline and ensuring that higher education remains affordable for students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the last tuition fees adjustment in the 1997/98 academic year, the Composite Consumer Price Index has increased by 40 percent cumulatively. Comparatively, the tuition fees adjustment is very modest this time," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The UGC-funded universities provide other financial assistance such as scholarships, bursaries and loans to needy students to ensure that no qualified students will be denied access to higher education due to financial difficulties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration also said its target cost recovery rate for tuition fee levels of 18 percent, set in the early 1990s, had been declining due to more expenditure being needed to deliver higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate is projected to drop to 12.5 percent in the next academic year, before improving slightly in 2027 to 13.4 percent following the tuition fee increases, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan stressed that the decision to put up fees has nothing to do with the government's budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't adjusted the tuition fee for more than 20 years, so we believe there is a need to moderately adjust the tuition fee. Our goal is to subsidise students with 82 percent of their tuition fee, but we are above this target," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our plan is to increase the fees in the upcoming three years. We don't have any plan to increase the fees after three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation welcomed the move, while calling for more support for students from lower-income families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 5.5 percent [average annual increase] is somewhat mild, because we are talking about inflation of about two to three percent. We are just slightly above that, trying to catch up a little bit, in terms of the cost recovery," said Victor Kwok, the group's assistant research director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously, on the other hand, as they gradually increase the tuition fees, they also have to proportionally increase their support, in terms of students loans, and in terms of student grants, for students from relatively less well-off families."

    Miniature art exhibition to showcase HK landmarks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A miniature artist on Thursday said that an exhibition showcasing unique Central and Western District landmarks would deepen people's understanding of Hong Kong's rich history and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Look Closer and Wonder: Central and Western District in Miniature" exhibition will display 22 artworks, with nine pieces new to the collection, in celebration of the 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Poon, president of the Joyful Miniature Association, hoped the artworks could give people a fresh perspective of familiar sites in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Central and Western District is very unique. First of all, because it is the heart of Hong Kong's political, economic, financial centre and it's also a cultural centre. From this area, you can see the earliest transportation, colonial architecture and also in terms of food, for example, you have cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong style cafe) and you also have a lot of declared monuments like the Man Mo Temple," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, you have the most classic and oldest [buildings], and on the other hand, you have the highest skyscrapers all at once. It's a melting pot of East meets West. You have Lan Kwai Fong out there, it's the gist of Hong Kong, everything that is the best is here, in Central and Western District."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One artist Hung Fai-chan spent a year recreating the corridors of an old public housing estate called "We All Grew Up Like This". He said he wanted to capture the memories of childhood games, before electronics, that many Hong Kong people grew up with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of my own memories inside this piece too because I also grew up in public housing. I have a few siblings myself so I wanted to capture the childhood games we used to play, like rock, paper, scissors up the stairs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also simpler games like marble shooting or even table tennis on the ground. These are all the games we would play as a child, like many children in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another artist Tim Ho worked with a team to recreate the Man Mo Temple in Sheung Wan. He said the project was challenging given its meticulous craftsmanship that took numerous site visits and extensive research to create the replica. He added the temple is an iconic landmark, so he hoped a lot of tourists would admire their artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want people to see that it is no different from the actual Man Mo Temple. We tried our best to really capture all the details of the temple. We want people to know that there is such a beautiful piece of architecture in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of our artwork is that it captures an angle you can't see fully in real life. It is usually crowded at the temple so you can't see it when it is empty. You also can't see all the little details. You will see the entire structure from a giant's perspective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition will be held in Admiralty from June 21 to July 8.

    Hundreds of Hajj pilgrims feared dead amid heatwave

<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomats from Arab nations on Thursday said hundreds of people had died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced intense high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports were conflicting, but unofficial accounts suggested that at least 500 people had died during the Hajj pilgrimage, with some saying the death toll was likely higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over two million people travel to Saudi Arabia. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage’s history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the high temperatures and intense heat made things especially treacherous for pilgrims this year, with temperatures hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday. (Agencies)

    'HK entrepreneurs in Guangzhou need more help'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Think tanks on Thursday urged Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more assistance to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation said that as of July 2023, there were 52 entrepreneurial bases in Guangzhou for young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau, with about 2,100 start-up projects underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A research team from the two groups visited two bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou and talked to about 10 Hong Kong entrepreneurs working in various industries there, including arts and culture, technology and catering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s assistant research director, Victor Kwok, said some Hong Kong startups there lack knowledge about the business environment and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are gaps that we observe, such as the difference between the skills, knowledge, experiences and the network of the entrepreneurs and the actual requirements of actually having the business to prosper,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok highlighted challenges arising from changes in rules and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We all know comparatively in the mainland, the policy change is sometimes faster than what is observed in Hong Kong, and that could be a challenge, because sometimes you apply for funding and then the policy itself expires before you actually get the funding,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok said a single, easy-to-use government application or website would be beneficial for entrepreneurs to keep themselves updated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incubators in Guangzhou should also be more proactive in assisting startups to apply for funding from the mainland government, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation and coalition also complained that all the entrepreneurial bases offer identical services. They said authorities should differentiate them based on the startups’ development stage or industry type, making it easier for entrepreneurs to connect with the right industry players.

    CUHK develops mRNA drug for nasopharyngeal cancer

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers say the new drug is better than current treatments because it can minimise damage to healthy cells. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758269_1_20240620134352.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists at Chinese University on Thursday said they had developed a new drug that had the potential to cause nasopharyngeal cancer cells to destroy themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drug uses mRNA bio-technology, which acts like a code to activate the death cycle of cancer cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scientists carried out tests on mice and said the results were very promising. They described the drug as a "smart bomb" because it not only targets cancer cells, but also attracts immune cells to help eliminate them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Anne Tsang, one of the researchers, said this new drug is better than current treatments because it could minimise damage to healthy cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All the traditional treatments are mostly systemic. They are chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and so they affect not only the cancer cells, but also the other normal cells," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For our drug, this drug mechanism will only target the cancer cells that are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus. So the normal cells will be safe...and so our human body will feel [many fewer] side effects, and so the patients can have a much better quality of life."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the throat, specifically the part that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It is often called "Canton cancer" because it is more common in southern China.

    Health minister concerned about hospital power outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau on Thursday said the hardware of all hospitals needs to be of very high quality, to ensure that patients receive proper treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came after a power outage lasting almost an hour at Kwong Wah Hospital on Wednesday night. The redeveloped building was only completed last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff carrying out surgery had to move to another room, while 25 other operations were rescheduled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said there will be a probe into what exactly went wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The quality of construction works and hardware indeed affects our medical services. The Hospital Authority and the hospital will investigate to find out what the problems were technically," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said the problem could be the fault of builders. After the hospital building opened last year, issues with electricity cables were discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not expect a new hospital to have a general power outage problem like that," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that is a systematic problem with the engineering system, or the monitoring system while the building was being constructed, then I believe that's a big issue."

 Phil Salt blasted an unbeaten 87 as defending champions England cruised to an eight-wicket victory over the West Indies in their T20 World Cup Super Eight clash in St. Lucia on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opening batsman Salt smashed seven fours and five sixes during a superb 47-ball knock at the Daren Sammy National Stadium as England made a flying start to the second round of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After restricting West Indies to 180-4 off their 20 overs, Salt's knock steered England home with a winning total of 181-2 off 17.3 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having squeaked into the second stage on net run rate, England will take a huge boost of confidence from beating one of the in-form teams at the tournament to top Group 2 with South Africa, who they meet at the same ground on Friday. (Agencies)

 Justice chief Paul Lam said the recent resignations of overseas non-permanent judges from Hong Kong's top court would not undermine the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two UK judges – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Jonathan Sumption – resigned from the Court of Final Appeal earlier this month, and Beverley McLachlin from Canada said she would not stay on when her term expires at the end of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, the secretary for justice said foreign legal experts were still confident in the SAR's judicial system, noting that two other overseas judges had joined the bench since the implementation of the national security law in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's normal for people to come and go. So, don't just focus on people leaving. There are also judges who are extending their terms and new judges who are joining," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the departure of the three judges, seven non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions remain at the Court of Final Appeal. The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there is no quota on the number of overseas non-permanent judges sitting on the top court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Basic Law does not state that there must be eight or 10 non-permanent overseas judges on the court over a long period of time. I think quality is the most important. We are not looking at the numbers. In fact, we invite judges who are internationally prestigious and can help Hong Kong develop what is called jurisprudence, which is the quality of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrests made by the police in the past month over the publishing of social media posts ahead of a "sensitive date" for alleged sedition under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, Lam said the government is not targetting specific dates but the intention of an act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No matter what day or time it is, if your behaviour constitutes a crime with an incitement intent, then there's a risk you will be charged. We are targetting the words and actions. It doesn't matter what day. The day you come out and say you support 'Hong Kong independence' or want to subvert state power, there's a chance you violate the law," he said.

 Zhang Zhizhen on Wednesday became the first Chinese man to reach the quarter-finals of the Halle grass-court tournament with a three-set win over fifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev of Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number 42 came through 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 [7/5] after winning the last four points of the deciding tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A really tough match. Last time I lost a third-set tie-break [in Stuttgart last week]. And today again, a third-set tie-break," said the 27-year-old Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was thinking, 'Okay, it's time. The perfect moment to get revenge'," Zhang told atptour.com.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang next faces American Christopher Eubanks, who knocked out defending champion Alexander Bublik 7-6 [7/5], 4-6, 6-3.

  World number four and French Open runner-up Alexander Zverev defeated Lorenzo Sonego of Italy 6-4, 7-6 [7/5].

  "I'm extremely happy with my performance," said Zverev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt like it was good tennis and I'm happy to be in the quarters."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa beat the United States by 18 runs in the first T20 World Cup Super 8 game in Antigua on Wednesday as Kagiso Rabada's experience came to the fore at the end of a tense game.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Having struggled on New York's slow pitches in the group stage, South Africa scored freely at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, posting 194-4 on the back of Quinton de Kock's fine knock of 74.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, U.S. opener Andries Gous [80 not out] provided the fireworks along with Harmeet Singh [38] down the order but fast bowler Rabada picked up crucial wickets in his spell of 3-18 and restricted the run rate as the U.S. fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The U.S. had won the toss and opted to field first, picking up the wicket of Reeza Hendricks early but De Kock cut loose as South Africa scored at over 10 runs per over during the powerplay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Kock reached his fifty in 26 balls and shared a 110-run partnership with skipper Aiden Markram off 60 deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harmeet Singh dismissed De Kock when he mistimed a full toss and was caught near the boundary and the all-rounder was on a hat-trick when he had David Miller caught and bowled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markram fell four runs short of his fifty when he chased a wide loose ball and Ali Khan took a sharp diving catch to give Saurabh Netravalkar his second wicket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Netravalkar's superb spell [2-21], the others failed to contain South Africa as Heinrich Klaasen dealt in sixes and scored a quick-fire 36 in an unbroken 53-run partnership with Tristan Stubbs [20] to propel them to 194-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American opener Steven Taylor [24] underlined his intent when he smashed a boundary off the first ball, but after four fours and a six, he fell to Rabada when a mistimed shot was caught at mid-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fast bowler also dismissed Nitish Kumar, who was caught at deep square leg, and U.S. captain Aaron Jones fell for a duck to spinner Keshav Maharaj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gous continued to resist, bringing up his fifty with back-to-back sixes, but the required run rate continued to climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was hope when Shamsi went for 22 runs in an expensive 18th over but Rabada returned to dismiss Harmeet, conceding only two runs in the penultimate over. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's volleyball team will face host nation France, defending Olympic champions the United States and reigning world champions Serbia in the first stage of the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China's team is eyeing a rebound from its worst ever Olympic performance in Tokyo last time, where the three-time Olympic champions were eliminated in the first stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Paris Olympics will be China's 11th consecutive Olympic appearance in women's volleyball since their debut in Los Angeles in 1984, when they also won gold for the first time, before also standing atop the Olympic podium at Athens 2004 and Rio 2016, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12 qualified teams for Paris were drawn into three pools of four at Wednesday's drawing ceremony in Bangkok, ahead of the FIVB Women's Volleyball Nations League [VNL] Finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from France, the United States, China and Serbia in Pool A, Brazil, Poland, Japan and Kenya were drawn into Pool B, while Italy, Türkiye, the Netherlands and the Dominican Republic are in Pool C. The pool winners, the pool runners-up and the two best-ranked third-placed teams will advance to the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic volleyball tournament at Paris 2024 will take place from July 27 to August 11 at the South Paris Arena in the French capital. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hosts Germany became the first team to qualify for the knockout phase of Euro 2024 on Wednesday thanks to a 2-0 win over Hungary, while Scotland drew with Switzerland and Croatia's hopes of progressing were left hanging in the balance after they were held by Albania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany followed up their 5-1 demolition of Scotland in the tournament's opening game by seeing off the Hungarians in Stuttgart, with Jamal Musiala and Ilkay Gundogan scoring either side of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Nagelsmann's team have a maximum six points with one game still to come in Group A, and are certain to progress to the last 16 at least as runners-up in the section.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary put up a fight but the hosts had too much quality in the final third, with Bayern Munich star Musiala firing in the opener midway through the first half after captain Gundogan refused to give up a lost cause in the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany then doubled their lead on 67 minutes as Gundogan, of Barcelona, swept home an assist by Maximilian Mittelstaedt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their recent struggles appear to be a thing of the past, and Germany have now won their opening two games at a World Cup or European Championship for the first time since Euro 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's hopes of progressing now hang by a thread, while group rivals Switzerland and Scotland played out a 1-1 stalemate in Wednesday's late match in Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland, backed by a large and noisy support, went ahead early on when Callum McGregor cut the ball back for Scott McTominay to score with a shot that went in via a big touch off Fabian Schaer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Switzerland equalised when Xherdan Shaqiri pounced on a stray pass by Anthony Ralston to smash a superb first-time strike high into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss saw Dan Ndoye miss a glorious second-half opportunity and Breel Embolo have a goal disallowed for offside, but Scotland deserved the draw which keeps their hopes alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They might even have won the game, with Grant Hanley hitting the post from a late header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland, quarter-finalists at Euro 2020, may already have enough points to progress but a draw against Germany on Sunday will make sure of second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland, who have not won a match at a major tournament since beating the Swiss 1-0 at Euro 96, can still qualify with a win over Hungary in Stuttgart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Albania's Klaus Gjasula scored at both ends, including a dramatic injury-time equaliser as his side drew 2-2 with Croatia in Hamburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament. (AFP)

    Louisiana makes Ten Commandments compulsory in classes

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758221_1_20240620063458.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry on Wednesday signed into law a bill that makes the state the only one in the country to require displaying the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American Civil Liberties Union immediately announced it would sue to block the law, saying it violates the constitutional separation of church and state and a US Supreme Court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry signed the bill along with a package of others he said were designed to "expand faith in public schools."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses," Landry said at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Christian and Jewish faiths, God revealed the Ten Commandments to Hebrew prophet Moses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other measures would authorise the hiring of chaplains in schools, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender pupil's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry also signed bills that would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve maths skills, and impose fewer curriculum mandates on teachers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil rights group ACLU and its Louisiana chapter along with Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced they would file a lawsuit to challenge the law that requires a specific text of the Ten Commandments be prominently displayed in all classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other state has such a law, the groups said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools," the statement said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Vietnam early on Thursday for talks with the country's leaders on the final stop of his two-nation tour of Asia after concluding a defence pact with North Korea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin's aircraft touched down at Hanoi's airport, where he was met on a red carpet by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha and top Communist Party diplomat Le Hoai Trung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an opinion piece timed for his visit, Putin applauded the Southeast Asian Communist-ruled country for supporting "a pragmatic way to solve the crisis" in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam, which officially pursues a neutral foreign policy, has abstained from condemning Russia's attack on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as praising Vietnam for its "balanced" stance on the Ukraine war, Putin listed progress on payments, energy and trade between the countries in the article published in Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country is the third nation Putin has visited, after China and North Korea, since he was sworn in for a fifth term in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam has been gearing up for a full state welcome for Putin, his first visit since 2017 and his fifth in total.
  <br/>

    Nowhere in Israel safe if war erupts: Hezbollah chief

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People attending a memorial for a killed Hezbollah leader watch Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's televised address.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and he also threatened Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterannean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza War. On Tuesday, the group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said "there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones" in Israel in the event of a broader war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also had "a bank of targets" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big...In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea," Nasrallah added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war," Nasrallah said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from authorities in Cyprus. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Elizabeth Hospital said on Wednesday it had launched an investigation after a blunder involving a feeding tube that left a patient fighting for his life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said the 61-year-old man was being treated in an orthopaedic ward and required a nasogastric tube to receive formula milk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson said the tube was inserted by a nurse on Sunday at noon and replaced in the evening in accordance with procedures. However, the patient’s condition deteriorated early on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Doctors immediately performed resuscitation and arranged bronchoscopy examination for the patient, where a nasogastric tube was found placed in his bronchus,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patient was taken to the High Dependency Unit before being moved to intensive care. On Wednesday, his condition was said to be critical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The hospital is saddened by the incident,” the spokesperson said. “QEH has met with the patient’s family to explain the incident, extend sincere apologies and express deep empathy. QEH will continue to closely communicate with the patient’s family and provide necessary assistance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority. A panel has been set up to investigate and recommend improvements within eight weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Kwong Wah Hospital said that it had called off 25 elective surgeries scheduled for Thursday after a power cut hit some of its operating theatres on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One surgery had to be moved to a different theatre during the cut, which started at 7pm and lasted for 50 minutes. It’s getting in touch with the affect patients and has apologised. Other services were not affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people, including eight Rohingya Muslims, were killed and several others injured on Wednesday after heavy monsoon rains triggered landslides in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People died in landslides at four separate places in the early hours of Wednesday, Mohammad Shamsud Douza, a senior Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said after days of heavy rain as the monsoon season began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said children and women are among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 1 million Rohingya live in crowded camps in the border district of Cox's Bazar, the world's largest refugee settlement, after fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh weather office said it expected heavy rains to continue for the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rohingya refugees mostly live in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheets, often on steep, bare hills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a terrible situation in the camps due to the rain, even the narrow paths are so slippery and dangerous," Rohingya refugee Mohammed Kamal said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain and the onrush of upstream water from India also left hundreds of thousands of people marooned in the northeastern region of Bangladesh, still recovering from a cyclone that hit the country's coastal belt in the southern part late last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 500,000 people have been affected by the flood in the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj, with water levels surpassing danger levels at six points along four rivers in the region, officials said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environmental protesters sprayed paint on Britain's Stonehenge on Wednesday, with orange marks covering some of the stones of the prehistoric megalithic structure on the eve of the summer solstice celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two people have been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument, police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is extremely upsetting and our curators are investigating the extent of the damage," English Heritage, the charity that manages Stonehenge, said on X. Stonehenge remains open, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monument, one of Britain's most visited tourist spots, also holds spiritual significance and attracts thousands of revellers, spiritualists and tourists during the summer solstice – the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In video released by environmental group Just Stop Oil, two protesters were seen running towards two of Stonehenge's megaliths and spraying paint as another person attempted to stop them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public were able to walk around within the stone circle, located in southern England, until 1977 when it was fenced off due to concerns over damage from a sharp rise in the number of visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just Stop Oil are a disgrace," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on X of the protest at the Unesco World Heritage Site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just Stop Oil has gained prominence in Britain for disruptive environmental protests, with its activists shutting down major roads, disrupting cultural and sporting events and even throwing soup at a Van Gogh painting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group wants the British government to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. (Reuters)

    'Tuition hike moderate but adds to students' burden'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sources say university tuition could go up from five to nine percent each year over three years. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758175_2_20240619205709.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A potential increase in university tuition fees has drawn mixed views from students and lawmakers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government intends to roll out a phased fee increase over the next three years, with annual increments ranging from five to nine percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lucy Ng, a third-year student at the University of Hong Kong, said she wants her school to put the money to good use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a student, of course, I hope the school can keep the current tuition fee. But if our school insists to have this increase, I hope they can explain how they will use this fee. Are they going to build any new facilities?" she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another HKU student, Emily, who majors in social work, said a tuition hike would increase the financial burden on students who rely on loans, such as herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm currently taking the government loan... They are burdened with the loans, so they have to repay in many years when they work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will definitely enhance the financial burden of students, so I don't think it's a very good act for the university to increase tuition fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lau Chi-peng, who’s also Associate Vice-President at Lingnan University, described the proposed increase as moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are two considerations: whether it would impose a burden on students and families, as well as the magnitude of the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears that the increase would be moderate and the process would be gradual. There would also be corresponding adjustments in government financial assistance, which could potentially involve extending the repayment period," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung urged the government to consider the affordability of students and parents before finalising the tuition proposal, to prevent “turning student loans into student debts.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Priscilla Leung of the Business and Professionals Alliance, who chairs Legco's education panel, called on society to accept the increase, in light of the government's budget deficit amounting to billions of dollars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in on Wednesday for a second term in which his African National Congress (ANC) will share power with other parties after it lost its majority for the first time in 30 years of democracy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A former liberation movement, the ANC came to power under Nelson Mandela's leadership in the 1994 elections that marked the end of apartheid and had long been unbeatable, but it lost its shine after presiding over years of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a parliamentary election on May 29 in which no party won a majority, Ramaphosa will head a government of national unity with five other parties, including the ANC's largest rival, the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While investors have welcomed the inclusion of the DA, which wants to boost growth through structural reforms and prudent fiscal policies, analysts said sharp ideological divisions between the parties could make the government unstable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just before the election, Ramaphosa signed into law a National Health Insurance bill that the DA said could collapse the country's health system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear what would happen to that law under the new government. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Shanghai Regional Centre was officially opened on Wednesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday announced it had opened a new regional centre in Shanghai to further strengthen its engagement and partnership in the Asia-Pacific region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The opening was announced on the first day of the two-day annual Lujiazui financial forum in the mainland’s financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the IMF said the new centre “will serve as a hub to promote research that can inform policies in areas of interest to emerging market and middle-income countries”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will help deepen the IMF’s dialogue with member countries and other stakeholders in the region, including international financial institutions, academics, think-tanks, CSOs, and the private sector,” the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, it said the new establishment would facilitate targeted capacity-building in the region, including via peer-to-peer learning, in collaboration with the China IMF Capacity Development Centre (CICDC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also expressed gratitude to China’s central bank for its generous financial support to its Shanghai Regional Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre’s launch ceremony, Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said he welcomed the new establishment in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe the Shanghai Regional Centre will deepen cooperation between the IMF and China, enhance macroeconomic policy exchange and coordination among the Asia Pacific countries, and support regional and global financial stability,” Pan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pan, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the same event that the Shanghai centre “will deepen understanding of perspectives from member countries, and foster international economic cooperation”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening of the new centre came after the IMF earlier upgraded its estimate for China’s economic growth for this year from 4.6 percent to five percent last month, putting its projections in line with Beijing’s full-year growth estimate at around five percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildlife officials have captured two wild boars that were spotted wandering around Sham Shui Po on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) used dart guns during the capture operation near Sheung Li Uk Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at around 10.10am when the pigs were seen at the junction of Tai Po Road and Nam Cheong Street, near a petrol station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boars were said to have later moved to the garden, located along Tai Po Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online footage showed police officers at the scene using shields for protection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Considering that the presence of the two wild boars in urban areas would pose a danger to the public, our staff captured and euthanised them,” an AFCD spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia signed a slew of deals on Wednesday, renewing a five-year economic co-operation pact and allowing exports of fresh durians, during a visit by Premier Li Qiang to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work with Malaysia," Li said in a statement, adding that focus areas included development strategies, mutually beneficial co-operation and exchanges to promote the building of a China-Malaysia community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Wednesday's closed-door meeting, Li and Anwar witnessed the signing of more than a dozen pacts on co-operation in areas ranging from the digital economy to green development, housing, tourism and communications, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new five-year pact that runs until 2028 provides for strategic collaboration in areas such as trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, a statement after the meeting showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-year programme was first introduced in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also agreed to allow imports of fresh durian from Malaysia after it meets sanitary requirements, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries also vowed to review visa-free travel arrangements set to expire in coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at US$98.9 billion in 2023.

    Govt moves full steam ahead with new incinerator

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it is working at full speed to get Hong Kong's first mega waste incinerator up and running next year, as it plans to stop using landfills for waste disposal by 2035.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Department led a press tour to a man-made island near Lantau where the incinerator, called I-PARK1, is being built.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Director for Environmental Protection, Michael Lui, said the plant will be able to recover heat energy from the incineration process to generate electricity for 100,000 homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In early next year, we plan to carry out a testing commissioning with a view so that we can operate the plant by the end of next year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we can at least achieve the very important step that we implement the first mega incinerator in Hong Kong to handle at least 3,000 tonnes of waste [each day]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another incinerator, capable of processing about 6,000 tonnes of waste per day, will be built near Tuen Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said construction could be completed two years ahead of schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui said both incinerators will use new technology to ensure that emissions meet international standards and do not harm people's health or the surrounding environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the government's plans, an environmental group said burning garbage should be the last resort, and isn't an alternative to reducing waste and increasing recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said opening two massive incinerators risks sending the wrong message to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said Hong Kong currently disposes of around 11,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste on average per day, and if the goal to gradually reduce the per capita disposal rate by around 45 percent is achieved, the amount would drop to about 6,100 tonnes a day – below the capacity of the two incinerators of 9,000 tonnes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only if the government thinks that their strategy action set out in the Waste Blueprint for Hong Kong 2035 is useless, otherwise the waste generation amount and the waste that requires disposal will be greatly reduced by 45 percent. This is not by the end of the blueprint timeline 2035, if reduced by 45 percent, it is saying very clearly it is a mid-term target," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means by 2026 or 2027, this is a mid-term, then the government can already get the city to achieve this target. So I don't know why the government still needs to propose even the 6,000 tonnes, the second incinerator, which is really overcapacity."

    Lawmakers bemoan 'useless' workplace accident fines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun said there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents since maximum fines for safety law breaches were introduced last year." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758129_1_20240619153422.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies involved in industrial accidents are not being punished strongly enough for safety law breaches despite an increase in the maximum penalty, lawmakers complained on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, the highest penalty for a serious violation of occupational safety laws was raised from a fine of HK$500,000, to HK$10 million and a two-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun said since the law change, there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one case that has concluded, two company bosses were fined HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of lawmakers said such a punishment is too lenient, with president of the Federation of Trade Unions Stanley Ng saying it shows last year's law change is "useless" when it comes to preventing industrial accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said regarding the pair fined HK$50,000, officials decided they would not have a strong case should they decide to appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is considered the sentences were not wrong in principle and the fines were not manifestly inadequate," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that it has only been a little more than a year since the legal changes were made and appealed to lawmakers to wait longer to see what effect the higher punishments have.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that officials will review the matter in around a year's time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government plans to raise university tuition fees over the coming three years, with annual increases of between five and nine percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Education Secretary Christine Choi had previously said it was time to raise the HK$42,100 annual tuition fee for local students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions, as it had remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the increase would be phased in as early as next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the current fee covers only 13 percent of the total cost and the government's target is for the fee to cover 18 percent of the cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi met with some lawmakers to explain the plan, with the government expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Evan Gershkovich will go on trial behind closed door on charges of espionage next week, but Russia has hinted at a possible prisoner swap for the Wall Street Journal reporter. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758132_1_20240619154436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Wednesday said it was waiting for the United States to respond to its proposals for a prisoner swap, a week before reporter Evan Gershkovich was set to face trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The ball is in the court of the United States, we are waiting for them to respond to the ideas that were presented to them," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's state media in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich, a US citizen and a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, has been behind bars since his March 2023 arrest and faces 20 years in prison if convicted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial is to be held in the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, where he was arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich has since been held in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, about 1,400 kilometres to the west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial would be closed to the public, as is usual in espionage cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich is accused of “gathering secret information” on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General’s office said last week in the first details of the accusations against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he believes a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That appeared to be Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will unveil eight measures to reform its five-year-old Nasdaq-style sci-tech board under the Shanghai Stock Exchange to promote the nation's technology and innovation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering a keynote speech at the annual Lujiazui financial forum in Shanghai, Wu Qing, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said reforms of the Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR Market, will also better facilitate the development of new quality productive forces, called for by President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the reforms will cover arrangements related to share offerings, underwriting and mergers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu said technology innovation is at the core of developing new quality productive forces, and long-term investments, or patient capital, shall be further expanded to support the technology and innovation enterprises in the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the CSRC will further ramp up supervision and law enforcement in areas such as high-frequency quantitative trading to protect investors, and will clamp down on financial fraud of listed firms by encouraging whistleblowers to report issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dubbed the “broker butcher”, Wu, who was appointed to chair the commission in February, is known for his forceful measures, including posing curbs on new share offerings and strict punishment for fraudulent listings and accounting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since his appointment, Chinese stocks have seen a rebound, following a three-year decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong stock markets advanced on Wednesday in early trade following his announcements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Pan Gongsheng, the Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said at the same forum that the country’s central bank is studying the implementation of government bond trading, along with the finance ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan noted that such sovereign bond trading will be implemented via a gradual process, and that the pace of sovereign bond sales, term structure, and the custody system will also need to be studied and optimised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed that such practices cannot be equated to quantitative easing, and said they are tools for managing liquidity and injecting base money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There will be both buying and selling [of the sovereign bonds], and it will be combined with other tools to create an accommodative liquidity environment,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank chief also suggested that there is more room to ease monetary policy as other economies are pivoting to cut interest rates this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that Moscow and Pyongyang would sign an agreement that would bolster their ties, and thanked North Korea for supporting the Kremlin's policies in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the start of his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Russian leader said in remarks carried by Russian state media that the “new fundamental document will form the basis of our ties for a long perspective.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also hailed a “close friendship” between the two countries based on “equality and respect of mutual interests,” and noted their “fight against the imperialist hegemonistic policies of the US and its satellites against the Russian Federation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin expressed his hope that the next meeting between the pair would "take place in Moscow" in an apparent invitation to the North Korean leader to visit the Russian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian president and Kim later signed a partnership that included a vow of mutual aid if either country is attacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear what kind of assistance the deal, described as a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” would call for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin’s first visit to North Korea in 24 years comes amid growing concerns over an arms arrangement in which the country provides Moscow with essential munitions for the war in Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile programme.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the number of business outlets remained stable in recent years, despite claims Hong Kong was going through a wave of shop closures due to a sluggish economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Commerce minister Algernon Yau made the comment when responding to a written question from lawmaker Andrew Lam, who noted that netizens had opened a social media group on the closures, with more than 300,000 users joining the group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted there were more than 95,000 outlets in the catering, retail, beauty and hairdressing sectors at the end of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of establishments of these industries had once recorded a drop owing to the impact of the epidemic in the last few years, but it has rebounded since the end of 2021 to remain stable with the epidemic subsiding in recent years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials do not keep records of shop openings and closures and that these were business decisions based on a number of factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said as small to medium enterprises faced challenges, due to more Hongkongers travelling north of the border to consume, the administration had been providing help through a number of measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include low-interest concessionary loans of nearly HK$19 billion to ensure these companies could maintain steady cash flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials would continue to closely monitor the situation, and help firms "ride out the storm".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The ex-husband of a fashion influencer found dead in 2023 was on Wednesday sentenced to 42 months in prison for stealing gold and jewellery worth more than HK$6 million and jumping bail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alex Kwong, ex-husband of Abby Choi, pleaded guilty in the District Court to stealing necklaces, bracelets, pendants, bullion and gold pellets between June 2013 and January 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court heard that Kwong falsely claimed to be engaged in a mainland gold investment business and stole items from six people he persuaded to buy jewellery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While on bail following his arrest in 2015, he failed to report to police as instructed and didn't turn up for a court hearing that year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was arrested in February 2023 at a pier in the New Territories while allegedly trying to flee the city by speedboat following Choi's death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong admitted failing to surrender to custody.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence, Judge David Cheung said Kwong's series of crimes over a period of 1.5 years  was not due to momentary greed, but deliberate action to steal from others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung noted that the defendant had since compensated the victims for their losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong, along with his father and brother are charged with murdering Choi, while Kwong's mother faces a charge of perverting the course of justice in relation to the case.

  The rise in the local bourse tracked gains across the region as Asian shares rose to their highest level in three weeks at the start of trading on Wednesday, boosted by a rally in tech stocks while the dollar wobbled after soft US retail sales data reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Regan Smith set the 100 metres backstroke world record at the US Olympic trials in Indianapolis on Tuesday, touching the wall first in 57.13 to shave 0.2 seconds off Australian Kaylee McKeown's previous mark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just over a month to go before the Games, Smith's win in the final sealed her place on the US team and sets up a Paris showdown with McKeown, who swam 57.33 in Hungary last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of myself," Smith said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Backstroke is hard for me sometimes but to fight back like this and get that back means a lot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff was second with a time of 57.91.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith, a three-time Olympic medallist who took bronze in the event at the Tokyo Games, still has two more events to contest at the trials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the second world mark to fall at Indianapolis after Gretchen Walsh smashed the record in the 100 metres butterfly on Saturday, an event in which Smith also swam and set a personal best time. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Edmonton Oilers held off a furious late rally to defeat the Florida Panthers 5-3 and keep their dreams of an improbable Stanley Cup Final comeback alive on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Oilers, down 3-0 after the first three games of the best-of-seven series, built on the momentum from their 8-1 thrashing of Florida on Saturday to claim a hard-fought road win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers now have the chance to level the series with a victory on their home ice in Edmonton in game six on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edmonton are bidding to become only the second team in ice hockey history to overturn a 3-0 series deficit to lift the Stanley Cup after Toronto achieved the feat in 1942.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor McDavid's second goal of the night in the dying seconds sealed a pulsating victory for the Oilers, who are hoping to end Canada's 31-year wait for a Stanley Cup champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Brown fired the short-handed Oilers into the lead after just 5min 30, snaffling possession near halfway during a Florida power play before coolly rounding Sergei Bobrovsky and tucking away the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers doubled their lead early in the second period with a power-play goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They held firm after McDavid's second goal of the night, an empty-netter, ensured a game six on Saturday morning at eight, Hong Kong time. (AFP)

    'Hong Kong to act as window to promote hydrogen use'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan says the development of hydrogen helps Hong Kong gain business opportunities. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758087_1_20240619111244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said it would be difficult for Hong Kong to pursue large-scale production and usage of hydrogen, but the city could act as the mainland's showcase to the international community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, the minister said limited space in Hong Kong made it difficult for the mass production of hydrogen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tse said the SAR could leverage its unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can act as a window, a base for demonstration, to promote hydrogen products overseas. The international community can also come to Hong Kong for financing when it needs to," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hydrogen development is not only for us and helping us to pursue carbon neutrality, but it is also an opportunity for business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government earlier announced its strategy on hydrogen development, aimed at addressing climate change and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with 14 trial projects in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the administration is now looking into which industries would be suitable and cost-effective to use hydrogen, which is relatively pricey, and will formulate standards and guidelines.

    Baseball legend Willie Mays dies at 93

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John F. Kennedy Jr. with Willie Mays at Shea Stadium in New York in June 1972. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758073_1_20240619100119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Willie Mays, the Hall of Fame centerfielder whose all-around skills made him one of greatest baseball players of all time, died on Tuesday at the age of 93, Major League Baseball announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mays, who brought an explosive exuberance to the game in his peak years, died of heart failure, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays played 23 seasons for the New York Giants, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets, from 1951 through 1973.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his prime, he could do it all on the baseball field. Mays was the epitome of what came to be known as a "five-tool player" – meaning he was exceptional at hitting for average, hitting for power, fielding, throwing and base running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Mays' talent was only part of what made him a superstar. He also played with a verve and passion that were discernible even to spectators in the cheap seats. He was known for playing stickball with kids on the streets of Harlem, near the former Polo Grounds where he played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the real games, fans delighted when Mays would sprint with such speed and fury that he would run out from under his hat as he stole a base or chased down a flyball to deep centerfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His snag of a fly ball in the 1954 World Series, sprinting with his back toward home plate some 460 feet away, is known simply as The Catch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays, known as "The Say Hey Kid" because of his standard greeting, was ranked second on The Sporting News' 1998 list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players – behind Babe Ruth and ahead of Ty Cobb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility, won the Most Valuable Player award twice and was named to the all-star team 24 times, a record shared only with Hank Aaron and Stan Musial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he retired, Mays held third place on the all-time home run list with 660, behind Aaron at 755 and Ruth with 714. He was also the first ballplayer to hit 300 homers and steal 300 bases. (Reuters)

    Ronaldo's Portugal scrape Euro 2024 opening win

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal beat the Czech Republic 2-1 to claim a Euro 2024 debut victory on Tuesday but they needed to come from behind with a 92nd-minute winner from youngster Francisco Conceicao.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the section's other clash, Turkey bested Georgia 3-1 in a pulsating match in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roberto Martinez's Portugal qualified at a canter with a 100 percent record, but only just scraped victory in Leipzig in their first match, under driving rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs went ahead against the run of play through Lukas Provod's fine strike from the edge of the box after the hour mark, but Robin Hranac's own goal soon pulled Portugal level before Conceicao's winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronaldo was thrice denied by goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek on a record Euros appearance and headed against the post, but was offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diogo Jota put the rebound into the net but the goal was disallowed after the VAR highlighted Al Nassr striker Ronaldo's infringement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not matter for Portugal in the end as 21-year-old Porto winger Conceicao struck from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs were left agonising after battling so hard and almost claiming a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It hurts terribly when you work like this for 90 minutes, you give everything and you lose in the end," said Czech goalscorer Provod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our defenders played an incredible game. We just needed a bit more luck."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A well-supported Turkey started the Euros in entertaining fashion with an end-to-end win over debutants Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid playmaker Arda Guler scored a brilliant goal, along with strikes by Mert Muldur and Kerem Akturkoglu, to delight the masses of Turkish supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia were dangerous after Georges Mikautadze levelled Muldur's superbly hit opener, and struck the woodwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was below his best but despite defeat his team offered enough to give themselves hope for the matches ahead, against the Czech Republic and then Portugal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 reaching a new record on a day that Nvidia edged ahead of Microsoft to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, closed 3.5 percent higher, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of the tech giants Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were kind of waiting for this moment, actually, for quite some time," said Angelo Zino from the financial intelligence firm CFRA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The semiconductor industry is now the biggest sub-industry in the S&P 500," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices rose on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 rising 0.3 percent to reach a new all-time high of 5,487.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.2 percent to 38,834, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up less than 0.1 percent at 17,862.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid the ongoing enthusiasm for Nvidia, other chip companies saw gains on Tuesday, including Qualcomm and Micron, which closed up 2.2 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="David Calhoun stood and turned to apologise to relatives of the crashes face-to-face. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758044_1_20240619042133.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's CEO acknowledged to a US congressional panel on Tuesday that the company's culture was imperfect, but insisted the aviation giant was making progress and committed to improving safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Our culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress," David Calhoun said early in the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun opened his remarks by standing to apologise to family members of victims from two Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing, an examination of "Boeing's Broken Safety Culture," follows an April session of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations featuring a Boeing engineer who testified that he was punished for raising safety questions about the top-selling 787 Dreamliner and 777.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun's appearance marks his first testimony before a congressional panel since an alarming mid-flight incident in January on a 737 Max plunged the company back into crisis mode. US investigators are still probing the incident with the Alaska Airlines plane, which made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, the Senate committee detailed additional complaints from Boeing workers, including an official filing from a whistleblower who worried that Boeing's lax policies on the use of damaged or inadequate parts could "lead to a catastrophic event," according to a subcommittee memo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing stands "at a moment of reckoning and an opportunity to change a broken safety culture," said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who is chairing the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The session comes ahead of a Department of Justice determination on next steps after concluding in May that the company could be prosecuted for violating a criminal settlement following two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, off Indonesia and in Ethiopia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blumenthal said there "is near overwhelming evidence... that prosecution should be pursued."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a federal court of its plans by July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the April 17 hearing, witnesses painted a disturbing picture of a company that dismissed safety questions and sidelined critics as it chased faster production and bigger profits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star witness was engineer Sam Salehpour, who went public with allegations that, because of flawed manufacturing processes, the Dreamliner could suffer a potentially catastrophic accident because of excessively large gaps in the plane's assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has pointed to extensive testing that it says proves the 787 is safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun emphasised that he welcomes when workers speak out about problems, viewing such expressions as a critical component of safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pledged to get back to the committee on questions about workers who may have been fired for expressing concerns about safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun also said he would provide details on instances on how the company responds to workers who engage in retaliation against workers who speak out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In connection with the probe, Blumenthal and Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, sent a letter to Calhoun seeking records that would shed light on Salehpour's allegations about the 787 and 777, as well as records relating to Boeing's whistleblower policies and protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same two senators also sent a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker related to the allegations, as well as other ongoing Boeing-related matters, such as a six-week FAA audit of the company following the Alaska Airlines incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate panel on Tuesday released details on additional workers who have come forward with problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes a new whistleblower, Sam Mohawk, who said that Boeing ordered improperly stored parts to be hidden from federal aviation inspectors, who would have demanded Boeing increase storage capacity and hire additional staff, raising costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing was attended by a small group of family members who lost relatives in the 2018 and 2019 Max crashes, which together claimed 346 lives. The group held signs with their loved ones at the outset of the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also held a press conference just ahead of the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun is a "mass killer," said Adnaan Stumo, brother to Nadia Milleron, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. "There needs to be criminal charges for the people at the top. The people in the driver's seat were responsible for 346 deaths, including my sister." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday morning for his first visit in 24 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit – at the invitation of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un – underscores Moscow's growing relationship with the nuclear-armed state since Russia began its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin was greeted by North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un at a welcoming ceremony at an airport in Pyongyang and the pair embraced and shook hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian leader issued a presidential order on the eve of the visit, saying Moscow was looking to sign a "comprehensive strategic partnership treaty" with North Korea, which his foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said would include security cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ushakov said the deal would not be directed against any other country, but would "outline prospects for further cooperation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will include one-on-one discussions between the two leaders, as well as a gala concert, state reception, honour guards, document signings, and a statement to the media, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Putin's aide Ushakov as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow has said Putin will next travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's key allies such as China.
  <br/>

  Pyongyang rarely hosts foreign guests, isolated diplomatically and having shut itself off even more since the Covid pandemic. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia edged ahead of other tech companies on Tuesday to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in the latest sign of the might of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, jumped 3.4 percent near 1:25 pm (1725 GMT), giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The California-based company, which is led by Jensen Huang, has seen profits soar due to torrid demand for its powerful GPU chips, which have set the industry's pace in pushing new advances in AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, Nvidia reported a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe over the next year the race to US$4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft," said a note earlier this week from Wedbush Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway." (AFP)

    Black hole observed 'awakening' for the first time

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This artist’s impression shows the growing disc of material being pulled in by the black hole as it feeds on the gas available, making the galaxy light up. Image: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758034_1_20240619021538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Astronomers have been able to observe a supermassive black hole waking up and setting the heart of its host galaxy alight for the first time, the European Southern Observatory said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The galaxy 300 million light years from Earth in the Virgo constellation had been quiet for decades until late 2019, when it suddenly began to shine brighter than ever before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre of the galaxy – where a supermassive black hole is believed to be squatting – since then has been radiating a variety of rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This behaviour is unprecedented," Paula Sanchez Saez, an European Southern Observatory astronomer and first author of a new study in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "most tangible option" to explain this brightening is that the astronomers were watching "the activation of a massive black hole in real time," study co-author Lorena Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most galaxies – including our own Milky Way – are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These cosmic behemoths are by definition invisible – not even light can escape the pull of their awesome power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only way to observe black holes is when they destroy something huge that lets off light in its death throes: such as a star that wandered too close being torn apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These giant monsters usually are sleeping," study co-author Claudio Ricci explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for the galaxy SDSS1335+0728, "we were able to observe the awakening of the massive black hole, (which) suddenly started to feast on gas available in its surroundings, becoming very bright," the astrophysicist added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial observations indicate the black hole has 1.5 million times more mass than the Sun, enough for it to be classified as a supermassive black hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is still on the lighter side, as the true heavyweights easily exceed a billion times the Sun's mass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The international team of astronomers is analysing data from a number of telescopes hoping to determine whether the black hole's activity is temporary – perhaps caused by a star being ripped apart – or whether it will continue to be active for a long time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is something that could happen also to our own Sgr A*," the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fortunately for us, our own black hole remains fast asleep. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Timberlake was arrested early on Tuesday on allegations that the singer was driving while intoxicated on New York’s Long Island, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was released from custody later in the morning after being arraigned in Sag Harbor, on the eastern end of Long Island. He was charged with one DWI count, with his next court date scheduled for July 26, the Suffolk County district attorney’s office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake’s lawyer and representatives did not immediately return requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor is a coastal village in the Hamptons, around 160 kilometres from New York City. In the summer, it is a hot spot for wealthy visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A young Timberlake was a Disney Mouseketeer, where his castmates included future girlfriend Britney Spears. He rose to fame in the boy band NSYNC and embarked on a solo recording career in 2002. As an actor, Timberlake has won acclaim in movies including "The Social Network” and “Friends With Benefits.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has won 10 Grammy awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Timberlake was in the headlines when Spears released her memoir, “The Woman in Me.” Several chapters were devoted to their relationship, including deeply personal details about a pregnancy, abortion and painful breakup. In March, he released his first new album in six years, the nostalgic “Everything I Thought It Was,” a return to his familiar future funk sound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake has two upcoming shows in Chicago on Friday and Saturday, then is scheduled for New York's Madison Square Garden next week on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli intelligence brief prepared weeks before Hamas's October 7 attack had warned military officials of the Palestinian group's preparations for an assault, according to Israeli public broadcaster Kan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military's signals intelligence unit drafted the brief in September, less than a month before the Hamas attack that sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, Kan reported on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the Unit 8200 intelligence document included details of elite Hamas fighters training for hostage-taking and plans for raids on military positions and Israeli communities in southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brief said the Palestinian militants were aiming to take hundreds of hostages, Kan reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The expected number of hostages: 200-250 people", the brief said according to Kan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unprecedented Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 251 people hostage, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 41 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive since October 7 has killed at least 37,372 people in the Gaza Strip, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Kan, citing unnamed security officials, the brief was known to intelligence officials in the military's Gaza Division and Southern Command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli politicians have rebuffed calls for a thorough investigation into intelligence failures surrounding the Hamas attack, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted any official probe should wait until after the war, now in its ninth month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military however said it was "investigating the events" of October 7, with a probe being "actively carried out" that would later be made public. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Immigration Department says some 180,000 people have not replaced their old smart ID cards, and they're urged to do so as early as possible.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department on Tuesday said the old form of smart identity cards will be invalidated in 2025 in two phases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For individuals who were born in 1970 or after, their ID cards will be invalid from May 12 next year; for those born in 1969 or earlier, their ID cards will no longer be valid from October 12, 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This applies to the old form of smart ID cards issued before November 26, 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department noted that some 90 percent of the old ID card holders have already replaced their cards by the end of last month. But some 180,000 people have not yet renewed their cards, possibly because they are working or studying overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They're being urged to do so as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities stressed that the invalidation of the old ID cards will not affect individuals’ permanent residency rights in the SAR.

    'La Dolce Vita', '8 1/2' star Anouk Aimee dies at 92

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Anouk Aimee received the honorary Golden Bear award in 2003 for her lifetime achievement. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758023_1_20240618221507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anouk Aimee, the French actress whose movies included Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita", Jacques Demy's "Lola" and Claude Lelouch's "A Man and a Woman", has died aged 92.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We bid farewell to a world-famous icon, to a great actress of French cinema who took on roles for some of the biggest names, such as Demy, Lelouch and Fellini," said French Culture Minister Rachida Dati on social media platform X on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's daughter Manuela Papatakis said in an Instagram post that Aimee had passed away at home in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her role as a lovelorn widow in "A Man and a Woman" (1966) famous for its "chabadabada, chabadabada" theme tune won her an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe for best actress and her entry into Hollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's elegant sophistication had already made her a star of such European masterpieces as Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" (1960) and "8 1/2" (1963), and she was unforgettable as the ageing showgirl in Jacques Demy's heartbreaking musical "Lola" (1961).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellini in particular revered her, saying her "face has the same intriguing sensuality as that of (Greta) Garbo, (Marlene) Dietrich or (Cindy) Crawford, these great mysterious queens, these priestesses of femininity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anouk Aimee represents the kind of woman who worries you to death," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That combination of "melancholy and passion" marked much of her remarkable career, with the American director Robert Altman bringing her out of retirement to rekindle her old spark with Marcello Mastroianni in the acclaimed "Pret a Porter" in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born Francoise Dreyfus in Paris on April 27, 1932, Aimee was the scion of a theatrical family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her life was turned upside down when German troops marched into the city when she was eight. Her father was Jewish, putting the family in mortal danger, even though she was raised a Catholic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We moved all the time. We hid... But then the Germans turned up and took over the apartment downstairs," she recalled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family sent her to the countryside where they hoped she would be safer, changing her name so she would not have to wear a yellow star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her lifelong love of animals was born from the comfort they gave her during her time in hiding, she later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war over, her career began at the age of 13 when she was picked from the street to play in a Marcel Carne film that was never finished for lack of money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finally made her screen debut the following year and adopted her character's name, Anouk, as her own. It would become popular in France thanks to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was French poet and screenwriter Jacques Prevert who convinced her to also change her surname to Aimee, meaning "loved".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career took off in 1949 with Andre Cayatte's "The Lovers of Verona". Her class and beauty brought her a string of roles including in "Montparnasse 19" by Jacques Becker before she began to work with Demy and Fellini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2002 she was awarded an honorary Cesar – France's Oscars – and Cannes paid tribute to her four years later. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Tuesday announced that it is working with four mobile network operators to enhance 5G coverage at 24 stations, with an IT expert hailing it a step towards Hong Kong becoming a smart city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a press release, the railway firm said it is installing 3.3 and 3.5 GHz indoor base stations in the 24 stations to provide a faster and smoother mobile service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upgrading works at Tin Hau station have already been completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new 5G network will be installed in Wan Chai, Kowloon and Admiralty stations this year, and other stations by the end of 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, called the upgrade a long-awaited move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, there were so many MTR customers complaining about using their mobile data, where the mobile data speed is very slow and [they] always [lose] connection," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this is something that MTR passengers have been waiting for so long so that they can have a much faster and more stable network in the MTR stations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong added that upgrading the railway infrastructure is an important step to turn Hong Kong into a smart city and an innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Communications Authority also welcomed the move, saying it will "significantly increase the speed and capacity of 5G services along MTR lines".

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says the government wants to import more care workers from outside of Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government will recruit talent from primarily Southeast Asia and Europe in the coming year, with Malaysia being the first stop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Sun spoke about the multilingual skills of Malaysians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are fluent in English, and many also speak fluent Cantonese and Mandarin. There’s a good talent pool and I think it’s worthy for us to give it a try,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During my visits to Southeast Asia, I can tell many people there are eager to come to Hong Kong. But we need to realise that they are not here on travel, they want to work. So if they could be introduced to what to prepare as well as the development opportunities in Hong Kong, that will increase their desire to come to the SAR.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said the government will try to recruit financial and technology talent from Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the welfare chief mentioned a three-year plan to boost the number of care workers in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme to import care workers for residential care homes was rolled out in June last year, and Sun noted that all 7,000 places available under the quota were used up in the first three rounds of applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said after considering factors such as an ageing population and manpower loss, the SAR will need to import 8,000 more care workers over the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that the priority is still on local workers. “I understand that many local care workers hope to earn more money and have better promotion opportunities, but fail to do so due to their lower education level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government will study if care workers with less formal education could be promoted, with the emphasis instead on their work experience, Sun added.

    Govt support to get brokers ready for typhoon trades

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Christopher Hui (middle) says there's a "holistic package" of support given to small-sized brokers over arrangements for remote working during severe weather. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757998_1_20240618184720.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small and medium-sized brokers have enough time and support to get themselves ready, officials said on Tuesday, as the financial market is set to remain in operation under severe weather conditions from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The securities and derivatives markets, including northbound and southbound trading, will continue operating during severe weather conditions, while banks and securities dealers will provide electronic services but shut down their physical outlets, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brokers are required to set up a remote office and adopt digital trading by the implementation date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For those failing to meet the requirements, they can assign a small number of staff to return to their workplaces in times of typhoons and heavy rain, in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said there’s a “holistic package” of support for brokers, especially smaller-sized firms, to put arrangements for remote working in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Technically we have the solutions ready in the market and the HKEx has already set out in the consultation document conclusions that they will provide necessary support in order to connect the potential service providers to the participants if they are needed,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Incentives are being given to the participants to upgrade themselves because for those that cannot do that before the end of September, if they need more time, we will support them through shouldering the relevant clearing responsibilities. At the same time, the regulators will pragmatically deal with their relevant compliance issues if they cannot during that period move everything online."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial services chief said people can draw on the experience of remote working during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Working from home or using technology or online, whatever systems are available to do all the arrangements, it's not something new to the market, and especially during Covid times when already certain members of our financial community are already doing that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what we are proposing here is not drastic change but rather incremental change which is contingent on experience that we get before.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that tests will be conducted in August to check market readiness, but noting that the official implementation will not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial industry on Tuesday welcomed the government's move to keep the local stock market open during typhoons and heavy rain storms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's stock market will continue trading under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robert Lee, who represents the financial services sector, said the new arrangement could enhance Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Lee, who is also a director of the Hong Kong Securities Association, called on authorities to offer more support to small and medium-sized financial institutions to help them adapt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The industry had been expecting it for quite some time now, especially it being mentioned in the Policy Address as well as the Budget. I think international firms and larger scale firms fully support this initiative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for some of the SMEs, or the local brokers, I would encourage the SAR government as well as HKEX to provide more assistance to them as they adapt to the new measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan said the industry now had sufficient time to prepare to operate in severe weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the right time to implement such kind of arrangement because during the last few years (of the) epidemic situation, a number of electronic trading systems and business solutions have been upgraded," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the implementation time will be this September, now we have sufficient time for us to effectively assist those smaller-scale firms to smoothly transition to the new arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Funds Association and accounting firm KPMG welcomed the new arrangement, saying it would put Hong Kong's bourse in line with other major markets on the mainland and overseas.

    Govt accuses association of 'harbouring fugitives'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757960_1_20240618162907.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has accused a charity that runs a college helping young people quit drugs of harbouring former directors on the police's wanted list.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In January, the authorities arrested four directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others who were not in Hong Kong were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday said narcotics officials have met the association's directors, but the board members' words do not match their actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities questioned the directors' claim that they have cut ties with former college head Alman Chan and founder Jacob Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, the two on the wanted list [Chan and Lam] are still directors of Christian Zheng Sheng Association Ltd and/or Zheng Sheng Charity Fund Limited under the association, and they can even operate the bank accounts under the association and its subsidiary companies," the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the board passed a motion not to recover millions of dollars the college had raised, which the two had allegedly transferred overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this is suspicious, and also shows that the board had no intention of helping students at the college.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said law enforcement officers will investigate the matter.

    Minerals investment highlighted in Li's Perth visit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s investment in critical minerals, clean energy and business links topped the agenda of Premier Li Qiang's visit to the Australian city of Perth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li said China's economy has continued to rebound and improve, with its new growth drivers gaining momentum, against the backdrop of sluggish global growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the final leg of his trip to Australia, the premier said China was planning major measures for further comprehensively deepening reform and steadily expanding institutional opening-up, and the country's business environment will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip to Perth, Li inspected iron ore miner Fortescue’s clean energy research facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fortescue’s chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company’s plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially “green iron”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think China chose us because it’s not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it’s the best technology to go green in the world and we’ve got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,” Forrest told The Associated Press before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we’re a great mining country, so by all means let’s go in harder after critical minerals, but let’s not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,” Forrest said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also visited Chinese-controlled Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia’s processing plant south of Perth to underscore China’s interest in investing in critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese flew to Perth from the national capital Canberra where the two leaders on Monday held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both attended a round table of business leaders in Perth representing resource companies including mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said business dialogue was essential to the bilateral relations between the two trading partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While there have been challenging times in the bilateral relationship between the two nations, I think it’s fair to say this is another positive point of progress,” Black told the meeting. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to approve a marriage equality bill, clearing the last legislative hurdle for the country to become the first in Southeast Asia to enact such a law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill passed its final reading with the approval of 130 of the 152 members of the Senate in attendance, with four voting against it and 18 abstaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill now needs the pro forma endorsement of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, followed by its publication in the Government Gazette, which would set a date within 120 days when it becomes effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand will become the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marriage equality bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through the House of Representatives right before the previous parliamentary session concluded in April. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to fight floods and droughts and ensure solid work in disaster relief to safeguard people's lives and property as well as social stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least nine people have been killed in southern China from heavy rains that triggered landslides, knocked out power for entire villages and buried crops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landslides triggered by severe flooding killed at least five people in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen others were missing, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four people were killed and two others were missing in Wuping county in Fujian province due to landslides caused by torrential rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Severe downpours started on Sunday afternoon, with authorities measuring 372.4 millimetres of rainfall over a 24-hour period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the southwestern Guizhou province, more than 1,100 people were evacuated due to flooding in several counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, northern parts of the country are battling drought, as the country faces two extremes of severe weather. (Xinhua/AP)

 Four varieties of watermelon will be featured at the upcoming Local Organic Watermelon Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual event, organised by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, kicks off on Friday at the Maritime Square Farmers Market in Tsing Yi, where people can buy local produce and interact with farmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four varieties featured this year include Super Sweet Black Angel 168, Diana, Huang Yu and seedless 3F-2728.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Mun-wai, an agricultural officer, said people could also purchase local produce through the Local Fresh website and app or through local farmers directly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added the festival aimed to promote local agriculture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The festival is to promote the local organic produce, to strengthen the sustainability of local agriculture, and to build a platform for the farmers to connect with the public and share their harvest with the public," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mrs Liang, a farmer, started growing watermelons last year and used a shed this year to minimise the weather's effects on crops, leading to a better harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that watermelons which were locally produced were fresher compared with imported watermelons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the morning we harvest the watermelons and in the afternoon they will be sold at the festival, so I hope everyone can support us farmers," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Accountancy giant KPMG on Tuesday said it has downgraded its expectations for Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) market this year, citing a global decline in dealmaking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  KPMG now expects to see up to 80 companies listing, raising HK$60 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, the accountancy firm had projected 90 listings, with revenue of HK$100 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, KPMG's Head of New Economy and Life Sciences Irene Chu said regional and global uncertainty is weighing on valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no shortage of companies that want to apply for an IPO... A lot of the time, it is about how attractive they are to investors," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is not as much about the local economic condition, it actually has a lot to do with the regional and global situation when it comes to interest rates and economic performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, Hong Kong saw 27 IPOs which raised HK$12 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was down from 31 listings with revenue of HK$18 billion in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KPMG said it expects Hong Kong will see more IPOs in the second half of the year thanks to the loosening of listing rules as well as supportive measures from the nation's market regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing earlier introduced the Chapter 18C listing regime, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, rolled out five measures to strengthen Hong Kong's status as a financial centre.
