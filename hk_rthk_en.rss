<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Friday showed off some of their skills and shared insights and stories from the Paris Games at an evening gala.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium was one of the events where local fans could interact with the competitors during their three-day visit to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening of the show, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong residents had been looking forward to meeting the elite athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the Olympics, Hong Kong had a fiery atmosphere for the Games, and residents watched free broadcasts through the night to support the mainland and SAR athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From watching the broadcast from ten thousand miles away, to seeing the athletes first-hand, I believe everyone is excited and looking forward to the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes shared positive vibes with Hong Kong fans, and showcased their skills at the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I, of course, have to play for my country on the court, but in life, I think we need to chill out, and be happy. I hope everyone can spend every day happily," table tennis player Sun Yingsha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shuttler Zheng Siwei said he missed his usual mixed doubles teammate Huang Yaqiong after being assigned a new partner. However, he was happy to be reunited with Huang at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People only cherish something after losing it. I believe everyone’s experienced this before. Please cherish the one who fights alongside with you and the one who accompanies you," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some mainland athletes, such as table tennis player Fan Zhendong and diver Quan Hongchan, used Cantonese to greet the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few SAR Olympians, such as gold medal fencer Vivian Kong, and shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet, were also at the stadium and shared their experiences with the audience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday said it has fined WeChat Pay Hong Kong for failing to prevent risks associated with the financing of terrorism and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following an investigation, the digital wallet service provider was ordered to pay a penalty of HK$875,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said WeChat Pay Hong Kong does not have a robust system for conducting customer due diligence reviews upon incidents that pose a risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA executive director Raymond Chan urged mobile wallet service operators to strengthen their due diligence procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVF (Stored Value Facilities) licensees should apply enhanced due diligence measures on their customers in situations involving potentially high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing," Chan said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These enhanced due diligence measures should be effective in ensuring that the associated money laundering and terrorist financing risks are properly managed."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kwan Wing-fai's company cooperates with the Hong Kong Blind Union to train visually impaired persons to become badminton racket stringers. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768351_1_20240830165654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Social Workers Association (HKSWA) on Friday urged local employers to recruit more disabled people when considering their hiring needs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the number of disabled people who had attained a bachelor's degree from eight UGC-funded universities tripled to around 1,500 in the academic year spanning 2023 to 2024, compared to four years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKSWA recommended that companies be given training before hiring people with disabilities, so they can be assigned tasks according to their strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athena Ng, who is visually impaired, said she was worried about communicating with her peers in the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people rely on visuals on when they communicate. For example, they would point at a particular object when referring to it. But the visually impaired are unable to [do that], leading to communication issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng now works for a product development company that cooperates with the Hong Kong Blind Union to train the disabled as badminton racket stringers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Kwan Wing-fai revealed his company has employed four disabled persons - all but one suffered from hearing difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was concerned about their working abilities to begin with, but he found these worries were unfounded as they performed even better than able-bodied people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They completed the project on time and even completed it earlier than our target. I think they give me the confidence to employ the disabled again," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Kwan from the HKSWA's Professional Development Committee said many non-governmental organisations are doing a good job in supporting people with disabilities by providing them with training and counselling services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I think the government may do more, for example, the government can support NGOs, to give more resources to NGOs to promote or support enterprises to foster an inclusive culture in the business sector."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 11.8 percent in July compared to the same month last year, marking the fifth month of declines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Friday showed the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.1 billion in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slump follows a 9.7 percent drop in June and an 11.4 percent decrease in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined further in July from a year earlier amid the continued impact of the change in consumption patterns and the strong Hong Kong dollar," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More outbound travels by residents during the summer holidays was also one of the factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the government said challenges remain, but the authorities will continue to support small and medium-sized enterprises, including those in the retail industry.

    At least 6 dead after Shanshan hits Japan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Typhoon Shanshan weakened to a tropical storm on Friday, but was still dumping heavy rains as it slowly churned through Japan, triggering transport havoc and landslide warnings, with up to six people killed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The storm, which at landfall was one of the strongest to hit Japan in decades, pummelled Kyushu island on Thursday with gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before making landfall, a landslide caused by the heavy rains preceding the storm killed three members of the same family late on Tuesday in Aichi prefecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi on Friday confirmed reports of one additional death, but said that "the relation to the typhoon was being studied".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more were feared dead and two others were missing, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight people were seriously hurt and 70 others had light injuries, Hayashi said, with many injured by broken glass after the typhoon smashed windows and ripped tiles off roofs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 200 buildings were damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rapid attribution analysis issued on Friday by Imperial College London, using peer-reviewed methodology, calculated that Typhoon Shanshan's winds were made 26 percent more likely by a warming planet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without phasing out fossil fuels, the root cause of climate change, typhoons will bring even greater devastation to Japan," said Ralf Toumi, director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coming storm prompted Japanese authorities to issue their highest alert in several areas, with more than five million people advised to evacuate their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday the Japan Meteorological Agency issued alerts for possible landslides in many parts of Kyushu, and as far away as Shizuoka on the main island of Honshu, the Tokyo region and nearby Kanagawa. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Friday called on the government to encourage students from countries involved in the Belt and Road initiative to work in Hong Kong after completing their studies here.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The request is part of the university's proposals to Chief Executive John Lee for his policy address in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, the university's vice-president for research and innovation, Christopher Chao, said the government should increase subsidies and scholarships for these students, adding that the advantages of doing so extend beyond the education sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because when we are going to all these 'One Belt One Road' countries, apart from the educational part, in fact, we are also talking about a possibility of doing investment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we are talking about the investment ecosystem, we are talking about how these things can be integrated together."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chao also urged the authorities to extend the Strive and Rise programme – which pairs students from underprivileged backgrounds with volunteer mentors – to countries participating in the Belt and Road initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such a move would help children in developing nations, while enhancing the global image of Hong Kong.

    Alcaraz knocked out of US Open, Sinner advances

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alcaraz on court following his second-round defeat to Zandschulp. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768318_1_20240830131810.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Carlos Alcaraz was knocked out of the US Open on Friday, as the final Grand Slam of the year lost one of its biggest crowd-pullers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the world number three and 2022 champion in New York, was stunned by Dutch world number 74 Botic van de Zandschulp 6-1, 7-5, 6-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz had made at least the quarter-finals in his three previous appearances in New York. Thursday's defeat was his earliest at a Grand Slam since a second round exit at Wimbledon in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat ended his dream of becoming only the third man in the modern era to win the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tennis schedule is so tight. I've been playing a lot of matches lately with Roland Garros, with Wimbledon, Olympic Games," said Alcaraz who lost a draining Olympics final to Novak Djokovic in Paris just over three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I took a little break after the Olympic Games," he added. "Probably it wasn't enough. I came here with not as much energy as I thought that I was going to come. But I don't want to put that as excuse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, orld number one Jannik Sinner, vying to add the US Open title to the Australian Open crown he won in January, breezed into the third round with a 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 victory over American Alex Michelsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's Sinner needed just an hour and 39 minutes to get past the 49th-ranked Michelsen, giving himself a match point with a crisp forehand winner down the line and polishing it off with a crosscourt forehand volley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a real improvement, for sure," said the 23-year-old, who had to rally from a set and a break down in an unconvincing first-round win over Mackenzie McDonald.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm looking to get better now in the next days," said the Italian, who hit the practice court shortly after the match "trying to understand what works here best on these courts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's see what I can do in the next round," added Sinner, who next plays Australian wild card Christopher O'Connell on Saturday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday re-appointed former lawmaker Lam Tai-fai as the head of RTHK's advisory board, with his new two-year term beginning on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said five other board members were re-appointed, including media veteran Ronald Chiu and former Law Society president Thomas So.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board has provided invaluable advice to the Director of Broadcasting and assisted RTHK in fulfilling its public purposes and mission as set out in the Charter of RTHK," Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am grateful that Lam and the five incumbent members have accepted reappointment to continue serving on the Board."

  The government also announced seven new members to the body, including City University governing council member Robert Lui, sports scholar Jim Luk, NGO chief Kitty Chau and Meggy Cheng, a top executive at a local dance academy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister thanked the outgoing members, which include lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen and Chinese University media scholar Anthony Fung, for their contributions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers had the chance to meet members of the national Olympic team on Friday, as a delegation held various meet-and-greet events on the second day of a three-day visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A group of 65 competitors from Team China are in the SAR to celebrate their success at this year's Games, after bringing home 91 medals from Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some competitors went to the Sports Institute and a school, where many aspiring athletes and students waited in anticipation to meet them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One girl, 10, came with a portrait of her favourite athletes, saying meeting them was an opportunity she could not pass up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the building next door. I was doing my summer homework when I saw the athletes coming out of the car outside my window. I told my mom to immediately take me there to meet them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I watched most of the competition that they had broadcast. As long as I can see my favourite athletes, no matter how much sacrifice or hard work, I am happy and willing to do so."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A form 1 student surnamed Ho waited outside the Sports Institute in the hope of meeting the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I can interact with them up close. I really like Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha. I started noticing Ma Long after watching the last Olympics and that inspired me to take up table tennis. I started the sport because of him," the boy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some athletes participated in a meet-and-greet event with the disciplined services at the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy to showcase their skills and interact with young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans cheered as the athletes entered the stadium in an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the exchange session, some youth representatives got to play table tennis against Ma and Fan Zhendong, who made do with a pot lid and a spatula as their paddles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said he was honoured and excited that the mainland athletes had come to Hong Kong, and praised them for their perseverance and unyielding spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My favourite is weightlifter Li Wenwen. She picked up her coach after she won gold and shouted 'We're done with work!' Wasn't that so exciting?," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The national team's perseverance, superior skillset, passionate performance and dedication to the country are all in line with Hong Kong's disciplinary forces, and also the spirit of the disciplinary forces."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation was to visit Victoria Peak and Victoria Harbour in the afternoon to take in the sights, before a gala show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will end on Saturday with sporting demonstrations in the morning for the public to enjoy, including badminton, gymnastics, table tennis, diving and swimming.

    Beijing blasts criticism of Stand News court verdict

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong says the court's decision on the now-defunct Stand News safeguards national security and the rule of law. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768297_1_20240830114245.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has hit out at statements made by the United States, Britain and the European Union after a court convicted two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called the verdict "a direct attack on media freedom", while Britain's foreign office minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West, said the SAR administration should "end politicised prosecutions of journalists and uphold press and publication freedoms" and the European Union said the ruling was "yet another sign of the dwindling space for press freedom".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said the court's decision safeguarded national security and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson also criticised the West of using press freedom as a political tool to make excuses for anti-China organisations, and smearing and attacking the rule of law in the SAR to advocate the so-called "chilling effect".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It went to say that press freedom in the territory has been better protected under a safe and stable environment following the implementation of the national security laws, and urged relevant politicians to stop harbouring criminals and interfering in the SAR's judicial and internal affairs.

    Vulnerable newborns to get dedicated care at hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The multidisciplinary team at Queen Mary Hospital. Photo Courtesy of the Hospital Authority" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768278_1_20240830085501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Mary Hospital has set up a multi-disciplinary team of professionals to look after babies born prematurely, while providing psychological and even palliative support for parents in case of emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 43-strong team comprises obstetric and paediatric healthcare professionals, clinical psychologists, and social workers. It has helped the parents of over 20 babies since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team springs into action whenever a baby is delivered between 23 and 25 weeks, the so-called periviability interval where medical intervention is often needed in order for the newborn to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to a quarter of the infants also develop severe disabilities later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading the team is Mimi Seto, an associate consultant at the hospital's Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said apart from caring for premature babies, the team also intervenes by delaying pre-term labour for expecting mothers by prescribing them medication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We use] antenatal steroid drugs to enhance the fetal lung maturity, and give them magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If needed, if [the mothers] are in pre-term labour, having regular contractions, we might also give the mother tocolytic therapy, which is a drug to stop the uterus from contracting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The logic, Seto said, is to allow the baby to receive sufficient prenatal treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she admitted tocolytic therapy may have side effects to the mother, even though it is safe most of the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some cases, the hospital also provides palliative care to parents, including counselling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seto suggested all mothers-to-be, especially those with a history of pre-term birth, to seek antenatal care as soon as their pregnancy begins and follow the advice by obstetricians.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pablo Castrillo escaped from a breakaway and held off his pursuers on the climb to the line for an emotional Vuelta a España stage win on Thursday as Ben O'Connor protected his overall lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Castrillo, a Spaniard who rides for Kern Pharma, attacked at just before the 10-kilometre climb to the finish of stage 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old celebrated his first World Tour victory, and the first by a Spaniard on this year's Vuelta, by crossing the line pointing skywards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dedicated his success to his team's founder and former president Manolo Azcona, who died during the night at the age of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought about Manolo the whole stage. I had his strength by my side in those last few kilometres," said Castrillo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I suffered a lot but to be able to win a stage in the Vuelta is just crazy," he added. "I don't have any words. I've gone to the end of my strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Castrillo finished eight seconds ahead of Max Poole after the other members of the elite escape group stopped chasing to avoid helping each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poole, a 21-year-old Briton, had been part of the breakaway the previous day when he finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor, an Australian who rides for AG2R-Decathlon maintained his 3min 16sec lead over the Slovenian from Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pack finished 6min 29sec behind Castrillo on a hilly 125.7 kilometre meander through Galicia from Ourense to the Manzaneda ski resort. (AFP)

    Root's record-equalling century revives England

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Root scored an England record-equalling 33rd Test hundred as the hosts established a strong position against Sri Lanka on the first day of the second Test at Lord's on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  England, 42-2 when Root came in to bat, reached stumps on 358-7. The star batsman made 143 – his sixth Test century at the 'Home of Cricket'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other England top-order batsman made more than Ben Duckett's 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fast bowler Gus Atkinson was 74 not out at the close – his maiden Test fifty in just his fifth match at this level – after providing Root with excellent support in a seventh-wicket stand of 92 in 19 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we have had a really good day," Root told Sky Sports. "Hopefully we can carry that on now and over 400 would be a really good total."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Root's 206-ball innings saw him equal the England record of 33 Test hundreds held by the retired Alastair Cook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to be quite patient and they bowled well for periods of time," said Root, who made his Test debut in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, all of Sri Lanka's pace trio took two wickets on Thursday, with Lahiru Kumara leading the way with 2-75 in 20 overs after being recalled in place of Vishwa Fernando following England's five-wicket win in last week's first Test at Old Trafford. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Holders Real Madrid will face Liverpool away and host Borussia Dortmund in a repeat of last season's final in the league stage of the new-look Uefa Champions League, the draw for which took place on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Every team will play eight games against eight different opponents in the new format of Europe's elite club competition, with all 36 clubs now pooled together into one league rather than split into groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-tech draw took place in Monaco, with Cristiano Ronaldo pressing the all-important button to make a computer algorithm determine the fixtures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid, who have signed France superstar Kylian Mbappé since winning a record-extending 15th European Cup, will also notably play AC Milan at home and will go to Atalanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real beat last season's Europa League winners Atalanta in the Uefa Super Cup in Warsaw earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool, who are back in the Champions League after a one-season absence, will also notably meet Milan and take on tournament debutants Girona.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, supporters of the Anfield club will perhaps be most excited about the prospect of hosting German champions Bayer Leverkusen, coached by former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, winners of the competition in 2023, will play at home to Italian champions Inter Milan and go to both Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they were also handed more comfortable opponents including Club Brugge, Sparta Prague and Slovan Bratislava, who have never played in the modern Champions League proper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other standout head-to-heads will include Bayern Munich against both PSG and Barcelona, and Arsenal against Inter and Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of clubs in the Champions League has increased from 32 in the past, with the 36 participants split into four seeded pots of nine for the draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every team faces two teams from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. The first matches will be played on September 17, 18 and 19. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street had a mixed showing on Thursday with the Dow reaching a fresh record after economic data indicating stronger second quarter GDP growth than initially estimated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped by 0.6 percent to 41,335, while the S&P 500 was flat at 5,591.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq slipped 0.2 percent to 17,516.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The movements came on the back of data indicating the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the April to June period – revised upwards from 2.8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer spending provided a boost, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, coupled with a stabilisation in initial jobless claims, brought some relief to markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial claims slipped by 2,000 in the week ending August 24, indicating that layoffs remain low, said Oxford Economics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's record came despite a 6.4 percent slide in chip giant Nvidia's shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the AI behemoth reported quarterly sales that beat expectations on Wednesday, investors showed nervousness that the company's growth might be showing signs of normalisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, its share price was up about 160 percent year-to-date and has accounted for a third of the S&P 500's gains this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, traders will be eyeing the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge ahead of a widely anticipated start to interest rate cuts next month. (AFP)

    Israel agrees to 'pauses' in Gaza to allow polio jabs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel has agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in Gaza to allow UN health officials to administer polio vaccinations in the territory, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The way we discussed and agreed, the campaign will start on the first of September, in central Gaza, for three days, and there will be a humanitarian pause during the vaccination," said Rik Peeperkorn, the agency's representative for Palestinian territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vaccination rollout will also cover southern and northern Gaza, which will each get their own three-day pauses, Peeperkorn told reporters, adding that Israel had agreed to allow an additional day if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday night the new measures were "not a ceasefire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said it supports the "UN humanitarian truce."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and European Union have both voiced concern over polio in Gaza, after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed this month in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN agencies have said they plan to provide oral vaccines against type-2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) to more than 640,000 children in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water – an increasingly common problem in Gaza with much of the territory's infrastructure destroyed by Israel in its war against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. (AFP)

    US Army criticises Trump staff over 'push' at cemetery

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Army on Thursday took aim at Donald Trump's staff over a visit by the Republican presidential candidate to the country's most hallowed resting place for its war dead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump went to the Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington with family members of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing during the last hours of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His campaign posted photos from the visit, including one showing him giving a thumbs-up gesture while standing with relatives at the grave of one of the Marines killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Army said an Arlington employee was "abruptly pushed aside" when she sought to ensure a law prohibiting political activity or filming on cemetery grounds was followed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the (Arlington National Cemetery) employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked," an Army spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going on the offensive, Trump's campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita has described the employee as a "despicable individual," while campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said she was "clearly suffering from a mental health episode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has made criticism of President Joe Biden's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a key note of his campaign ahead of the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The withdrawal was made as part of a peace deal signed by the Trump administration with the Taliban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uproar over the incident at Arlington on Monday is the latest controversy in Trump's troubled relationship with the military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military said troops killed a Palestinian militant leader and six others on Thursday, the second day of large-scale "counter-terrorism" operations in the occupied West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A military spokesman gave an overall death toll of 16 Palestinian militants since Israeli forces launched coordinated raids across the northern West Bank on Wednesday. The Palestinian health ministry reported at least 15 dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A military statement said five were killed on Thursday in the Tulkarem refugee camp including Muhammad Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa. Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said he was its commander in the nearby Nur Shams refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, "he was a head of a terror network in Nur Shams," also accusing Jaber of "inciting" young Palestinians to carry out attacks against Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoshani told an online media briefing that Jaber was killed in "a significant exchange of fire" between Israeli forces and "armed terrorists hiding" in a mosque in the Tulkarem camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tulkarem governor Mustafa Taqatqa rejected the army's account, saying the five men were not inside the mosque when killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A rocket was fired at a house and the young men were not in the mosque," said Taqatqa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoshani said that one member of the Israeli security forces was injured in the operation that killed Jaber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military separately said it killed two "terrorists" in Jenin, also in the northern West Bank, taking its reported death toll of Palestinian militants to 16 since the raids began early on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the military, nine of them were killed on Wednesday, the first day of the simultaneous raids. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Caroline Groot of the Netherlands rode to victory to earn herself the first gold medal at this year's Paralympic Games on Thursday in the women's para cycling track C4-5 500 metres time trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The seven-time world champion finished the race in 35.566 seconds at the National Velodrome in Paris, over a second faster than silver medallist Marie Patouillet of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Dutch had broken the World and Paralympic record earlier in the day with a time of 35.390 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French cyclist finished in 36.700 seconds, while Canadian Kate O'Brien completed the podium with 36.873 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holder of the C4 category in this event, Kadeena Cox of Great Britain, fell off her bike early on, and could not finish the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The C4-5 class is for cyclists who have impairments affecting their legs, arms, and/or trunk, but still have the capability to use a standard bike.

    Blue Origin completes latest space tourism flight

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Blue Origin flew its latest group of six thrill-seekers to the edge of space and back again on Thursday, including the youngest-ever woman to complete the feat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mission NS-26 marked the eighth human spaceflight for the company, founded by Jeff Bezos, as it presses ahead in the emerging suborbital tourism market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Karsen Kitchen, a 21-year-old senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, became the youngest woman ever to cross the Karman Line, the internationally recognised boundary marking the edge of space, 100 kilometres above the Earth's surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin's small New Shepard rocket blasted off at 8:00 am local time (1300 GMT) from the company's Launch Site One base in west Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After liftoff, the sleek and spacious capsule separated from its booster, which boasts zero carbon emissions, before the rocket performed a precise vertical landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the spaceship soared beyond the Karman Line, passengers had the chance to marvel at the Earth's curvature and unbuckle their seatbelts to float during a few minutes of weightlessness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being there in the darkness of space... there's no way to talk about how impressive that is," said Rob Ferl, a Nasa-funded researcher who conducted an experiment during the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule then reentered the atmosphere, deploying its parachutes for a desert landing near the launch site. The total flight time is typically around 10 to 11 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of its tickets, but prices are believed to vary significantly based on the individual selected, their net worth, and the social capital they bring to the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first seat sold in a 2021 charity auction went for US$28 million, but notable guests like Star Trek actor William Shatner have flown on Blue Origin flights for free. Others have reported paying several hundred thousand dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin's main competitor in the suborbital space market, Virgin Galactic, is currently on a two-year pause from commercial operations as it upgrades its fleet. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week as the US labour market remains healthy in the face of high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jobless claims ticked down by 2,000 to 231,000 for the week of August 24, the Labour Department reported on Thursday. That's just below the 232,000 new filings analysts were expecting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 4,750 to 231,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are considered a proxy for layoffs, remain low by historic standards. They have ticked up in recent months though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From January through May, claims averaged a paltry 213,000 a week. But they started rising in May, hitting 250,000 in late July and adding to evidence that high interest rates were finally cooling a red-hot US job market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits rose by 13,000 to 1.87 million for the week of August 17. (AP)

 Members of the national team arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday to celebrate their success at this year's Olympics, with a delegation including 59 competitors who were either individual champions or part of winning teams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of 65 competitors were in the SAR for a three-day visit, with events including an evening reception and banquet hosted by the Hong Kong government, followed by a gala show and sporting demonstrations in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the athletes at a banquet, Chief Executive John Lee said their visit will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to pursue careers in the sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking back, the mainland's Olympic athletes delegation has visited Hong Kong several times. Their visits not only enhance emotional exchanges of the people between the two places, but also facilitate the exchange and development of sports culture," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that this visit will further deepen the profound friendship between Hong Kong and the mainland. It will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to engage in sports careers and strive for excellence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation visiting the SAR was all-time great in table tennis, Ma Long, sporting a gold from the team event – the sixth he has won in his illustrious career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meet-the-media event, Ma said it was the fourth time he had joined a visit to Hong Kong, adding that he is always touched by the warm greetings he receives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time around, I hope to have more opportunities to communicate with the young people in Hong Kong. I think this would definitely be a special memory in my career," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After the Olympics, many people have been asking me about my future plans. As of now, I am still an athlete. Of course, if there are any changes, I will definitely let everyone know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving superstar Quan Hongchan had captured the hearts of many fans with her cute personality as she struck gold again in the women's individual 10 metres platform and the synchronised 10 metres platform with teammate Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think if you have passion, go for it. Don’t be afraid of failure. I would also like to thank everyone for liking me so much," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, swimmer Pan Zhanle, who made headlines for his world record-setting victory in the 100 metres freestyle, said he was looking forward to meeting the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will first train myself well. When I become more mature, I can then be a role model for others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team won a total of 91 medals at the Paris Games, including 40 golds, 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

    Former Stand News editors convicted of sedition

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768189_1_20240829180525.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News were found guilty on Thursday of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen and acting chief editor Patrick Lam were convicted of conspiring to publish and reproduce seditious publications between July 2020 and December 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News' parent company, Best Pencil Limited, was also found guilty of the same offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written judgement, District Court judge Kwok Wai-kin ruled that 11 of the 17 publications raised by the prosecution were seditious, noting the political climate at the time was extremely heated and many people were unhappy with the SAR and central governments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The published materials included interviews with opposition figures as well as commentaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that the political ideology of Stand News was localism and its stance was to "support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the anti-extradition bill movement, it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government,” Kwok wrote in the judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that Chung knew and approved of the articles’ seditious intentions and offered Stand News as a platform to incite hatred against central and SAR authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge also noted that Lam approved one of the articles found to be seditious, while at the same time voicing support for the anti-extradition bill movement in a forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict, originally slated for last October, was postponed three times pending an appeal in a separate sedition case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing has been adjourned to September 26, and both Chung and Lam were freed on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They each face up to two years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was absent from the hearing on Thursday due to a health issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence lawyer Audrey Eu read Lam’s mitigation letter in court, which said Stand News journalists sought to run a news outlet with fully independent editorial standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Journalists are not only responsible for their own reports. They are also failing in their duty if they deliberately avoid reporting when they know the public has the right to be informed,” Eu quoted Lam as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also revealed that Lam is suffering from a “rare disease” that required chemotherapy, and it would be difficult for him to receive medical care if jailed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written mitigation letter submitted to the court, Chung said it is the “inescapable responsibility” of journalists to report the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior counsel Eu told the court that both defendants had spent over 10 months behind bars before getting bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News closed down in December 2021 after police raided its office and froze its assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the court after the verdict, chief superintendent from the national security unit, Steve Li, said police welcomed the court's decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the national security department took the enforcement against the Stand News on December 2021, some people criticised us that we are suppressing the freedom of the speech and the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the judge's verdict has clearly illustrated the necessity and the lawfulness of the enforcement [action] taken on that day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at another event, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said authorities respected and valued media freedom, which is protected by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all journalists report based on facts, I think there would not be situations restricting the freedom of the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Criticising the government is not an action that is not allowed. We see news articles criticising the government every day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late Thursday evening, a government spokesman said "any individual or organisation that incites hatred and engages in acts and activities endangering national security can never escape sanctions of the law, and such malicious acts will surely be duly punished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added, "To distort words and acts that incite hatred as 'journalistic work' as such individuals and organisations did is indeed the gravest insult against the professional journalists of Hong Kong."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A High Court jury on Thursday convicted one person and cleared six others over a plot to bomb and shoot police officers in 2019, after Hong Kong's first-ever trial involving United Nations anti-terrorism legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Chun-pong, who was 29 when he was arrested, was found guilty of conspiracy to cause explosion likely to endanger life or property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to appear in court next Monday to offer a mitigation plea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six co-defendants, Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Justin Hui and Lau Pui-ying were cleared of related charges, including conspiring to set off bombs and conspiracy to murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Cheung Chun-fu, had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of possessing explosives and firearms and was given an 18-month prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution had told the court that the bomb plot involved planting explosives in Wan Chai during a rally to mark International Human Rights Day in December 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, chief superintendent Steve Li from the national security police said he would not comment on the court's decision, but stressed the case was very serious in nature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very serious case, involving genuine firearms, explosives, and a very organised plot to kill police and other innocent people as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But as a police, I can assure that we have tried our best to protect our society."

    Labour rights group says heat protections not enough

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Survey shows workers felt unwell while working under hot weather and 40 percent of employers provided insufficient heat relief measures.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour rights group, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, on Thursday said around 40 percent of employers had insufficient measures to prevent heat stroke among workers during hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association surveyed around 400 workers, mainly construction workers and cleaners, between June and August 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that nearly 50 percent of respondents had felt unwell while working under hot weather, with symptoms including dizziness and headaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also found that workers lacked sufficient rest time during hot conditions, with 40 percent of respondents saying they did not have the basic 10 to 15 minutes of rest every two hours, while nearly half did not receive extra rest during a Heat Stress at Work Warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, head of the association, said employers misunderstood the guidelines from the Labour Department, leading to workers' rest times being reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we only focus on when the heat warning is in effect, the employer needs to provide equipment or measures for cooling. But if they do that, they can reduce the rest time. This is the misleading information for us, because our calculation is we must have a basic rest time, 10 to 15 minutes, plus the extra resting time when the heat warning is in effect. I think most employers or employees do not know this information."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested the government emphasise workers' basic rest time and eliminate the "rest time reducing" approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu believed that due to a lack of legal weight behind the current guidelines, employers may not be willing to cooperate proactively with the recommendations. She hopes legislation could be enacted in future to hold employers accountable.

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday met with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Beijing on the third and final day of his visit to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's commitment to the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-US relations remains unchanged," Xi said during the meeting at the Great Hall of the People.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said bilateral ties should be developed based on mutual respect, peace co-existence and win-win cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi called on Washington to work with Beijing in the same direction, and view China and its development in a positive and rational manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As two major countries, China and the United States should be responsible for history, for the people and for the world, and should be a source of stability for world peace and a propeller for common development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan said US President Joe Biden is committed to managing the relationship to avoid conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Biden is committed to responsibly managing this consequential relationship to ensure the competition does not veer in the conflict or confrontation, and to work together where our interests align," Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to maintaining high level diplomacy and till this end President Biden looks forward to engaging with you again in the coming weeks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of his visit on Tuesday, Sullivan has met with high-ranking officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Development sectors will need more workers: study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resource body on Thursday said its research indicated the development and real estate sectors would need more workers in the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management based the finding on a study of 300 companies in 20 sectors between April and June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the overall workforce in Hong Kong would grow by two percent by 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute said demand for manpower in fields such as architecture, engineering, and construction was expected to grow by up to nine percent, due to major development projects such as the Northern Metropolis and Kau Yi Chau Artificial Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, technological advances would lead to fewer jobs in the retail, transportation and media sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute's president Lawrence Hung, called on the government to adjust its talent recruitment efforts accordingly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should actively listen to industry feedback, provide more proactive measures for businesses to fill vacancies, and adjust talent admission schemes based on actual circumstances to effectively attract overseas talent to supplement the local talent pool," he said in a statement.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A court in Thailand on Thursday found Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, a member of a famous Spanish acting family, guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced him to life in prison, in a lurid case that involved the victim being dismembered.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Koh Samui Provincial Court issued an initial sentence of death for Sancho, but commuted it to life imprisonment due to his cooperation during the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, a 30-year-old chef with a YouTube channel, had been charged with the murder of Edwin Arrieta Arteaga, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon from Colombia, while the two were on the Thai holiday island of Koh Pha-ngan in August last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The island is famous for its monthly “Full Moon” beach parties, attracting travellers from around the world for all-night raves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convicted man is the son of Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre, a prominent Spanish actor, and Silvia Bronchalo, who has also been in acting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both parents are 49 years old and attended Thursday's court session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At his trial on the island of Samui, Sancho claimed he got into a fight with Arrieta for allegedly trying to sexually assault him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that Arrieta fell as they scuffled and hit his head on a bathtub, losing consciousness and then dying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had pleaded not guilty to charges of premeditated murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho acknowledged dismembering the victim’s body and disposing of the parts on land and at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the charge of concealing or damaging a body, he received a four-month prison sentence, reduced to two months for acknowledging the act, said Paisan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had also pleaded not guilty to the charge of destroying another person's documents — the victim’s passport — for which he received a two-year prison term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The elements of the case — violent death on a holiday island, the celebrity connections and the lurid details — attracted huge coverage in Spanish media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HBO produced a Spanish-language documentary on the events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case came to light when trash collectors found what the Bangkok Post newspaper described as a sawed-off pelvis and intestines weighing about 5 kilos in a sack at a rubbish dump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after that, Sancho reported to police that Arrieta was missing, and officers then gathered evidence linking the two men that led them to detain and interrogate him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police established a narrative, claiming to the press that Sancho had confessed to the murder and saying he had planned it because Arrieta threatened to disgrace him and his family by revealing their alleged sexual relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, through his father and his lawyers, said that was a distorted version of what he told police, and denied having a sexual relationship with Arrieta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police obtained surveillance video showing Sancho allegedly purchasing a knife, rubber gloves, garbage bags and cleaning solutions at a convenience store before Arrieta's death, which prosecutors claimed bolstered the charge of premeditated murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his closing statement earlier in his trial, Sancho told the court he regretted his actions, the Spanish newspaper El País reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am sorry that a life has been lost and that parents have lost a son,” Sancho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am sorry that his family was not able to bury him properly. I’m sorry for what I did after the death.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday rolled out the red carpet for a delegation of athletes who competed for the national team at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  SAR officials and primary school students welcomed the 90-member delegation at the airport, which included 65 elite athletes, eight coaches and some administrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan thanked the Olympians for making a three-day visit to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe many Hong Kong residents are as happy as I am. I thank the coaches and athletes for coming to Hong Kong just shortly after the closing of the Olympic Games, allowing us to get a close-up glimpse of the national team athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan, who led the delegation said he felt welcome as soon as he arrived, adding the mainland and Hong Kong should work together to carry forward the spirit of sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have exchanges with the SAR government, departments and residents, especially young people. We will learn from each other, build friendships and contribute to the development of the motherland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One eight-year-old fan was at the airport to greet the athletes and he said he couldn't sleep the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I was too excited! I'd been waiting for this day to come and I couldn't sleep at night! I want to meet Quan Hongchan the most because I like diving. But I'm too short so I couldn't see her," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan said she wanted to meet the table tennis players the most, but she failed to grab a ticket for the gala show and demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to buy a ticket, but I failed. Everyone loves them...I was so excited when I saw Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha because I supported them throughout the whole Paris Olympics," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will meet the press on Thursday afternoon and attend a reception and banquet hosted by the SAR government in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also meet fans at a gala show on Friday and showcase their skills in a series of demonstrations on Saturday.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Novak Djokovic hits a backhand against Laslo Djere in his second round match on day three of the US Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768129_1_20240829130013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Novak Djokovic racked up his 90th win at the US Open on Wednesday by defeating Serb compatriot Laslo Djere who retired in the third set of their second round clash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a four-time champion at the tournament and seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title, was leading 6-4, 6-4, 2-0 when Djere called it quits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world 109, who pushed his countryman to five sets in New York last year, needed a medical time-out to treat an injury just before dropping the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic had himself required a visit from the trainer for what appeared to be a side strain after sealing the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number two Djokovic is now the only man to have won 90 matches at all four Grand Slams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not what we want to see when there's a retirement. Laslo had an injury which took him off the tour for some time and he's been struggling to come back," said Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's such a good player in these conditions and the second set should have been his, he was 4-2 up. I don't know if my winning the second set probably put more burden on him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic will next meet Australia's Alexei Popyrin who he defeated at the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year with both matches going to four sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Popyrin is on a rich vein of form having won the Montreal Masters on the eve of the US Open. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="General Zhang Youxia, right, holds talks with Jake Sullivan in Beijing. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768127_1_20240829125644.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Thursday met with a top Chinese military official on the third and final day of his visit to China, as the two countries strengthened communication in an effort to prevent differences over the South China Sea and Taiwan from spiralling into conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, warned the US to stop "collusion" with Taiwan, saying the island is "the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said, according to a readout by Defence Ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But 'Taiwan independence' and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are incompatible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan, for his part, stressed the importance of stability in the strait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first meeting between a vice chair of the Central Military Commission and a senior American official since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Your request to meet with me shows the value you attach to military security and the relationship between our militaries,” Zhang told Sullivan in opening remarks earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know it is rare that we have the opportunity to have this kind of exchange and given the state of the world and the need for us to responsibly manage US-China relations, I think it's a very important meeting," Sullivan replied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's meeting followed the latest round of China-US strategic communication held by Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Sullivan on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency described the discussions as "candid, substantive and constructive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said "China-US relations have experienced ups and downs, and that reviewing this experience and its lessons will help forge a better future and find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other," Xinhua reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Taiwan, the foreign minister said "Taiwan independence" poses the biggest risk to cross-strait peace and stability, and that Washington should adhere to the one-China principle and should not support "Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan said China and the US should treat each other as equals, and that Washington has no intention of decoupling from Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Sullivan also agreed on arrangements for a video call between theatre leaders of the two militaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the White House said both countries would plan for a phone call between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in the coming weeks. (Agencies)

    Court threatens to shut down X in Brazil

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Elon Musk to name a legal representative for X in Brazil within 24 hours or face the site's suspension in the country. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768121_1_20240829114314.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Wednesday threatened to shut down the local operations of X, formerly Twitter, unless its billionaire owner Elon Musk named a legal representative in Brazil within 24 hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The order from Justice Alexandre de Moraes was the latest development in an ongoing feud with Musk’s platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company clashed with de Moraes earlier this year over free speech, accounts associated with the far-right and misinformation on the platform, with the social media platform claiming to be a victim of censorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, X said it was removing all remaining Brazil staff in the country “effective immediately,” saying de Moraes had threatened its legal representative in the country with arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday notified X of de Moraes’ order in a reply to a post from the company’s global government affairs account on the social platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case of non-compliance with the determination, the decision could bring about suspension of the social media network’s activities in Brazil,” the court said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, free speech is a constitutional right that’s more permissive than in many countries, including Brazil, where de Moraes in April ordered an investigation into Musk over the dissemination of defamatory fake news and another probe over possible obstruction, incitement and criminal organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil’s political right has long characterised de Moraes as overstepping his bounds to clamp down on free speech and engage in political persecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His defenders have said his actions are lawful, supported by at least the majority of the court’s bench, and have served to protect democracy at a time when it is threatened. (AP)

    Dozens hurt as typhoon hits southern Japan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Typhoon Shanshan slammed into Japan on Thursday, injuring dozens as howling winds smashed windows and blew tiles off houses while torrential rains sparked floods and landslide warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan's most powerful typhoon this year, packing gusts up to 252 kilometres per hour, made landfall on the main southern island of Kyushu, home to 12.5 million people, around 8am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the arrival, authorities issued their highest alert level in places, advising hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate and warning of "life-threatening" flooding, landslides and storm surges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coastal city of Miyazaki has so far recorded 26 injuries – including some from a tornado – with 124 incidents of damage to buildings, a disaster official told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the injuries were caused by strong winds smashing windows, with none life-threatening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Broadcaster NHK reported that nine people were hurt in nearby Kagoshima.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unverified social media footage showed a small river in the city of Beppu turned into a raging torrent of dark water and a fallen tree hanging precipitously above a rainswept road near Oita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student Aoi Nishimoto, 18, said he had called his family in Miyazaki.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our home is fine, but there was a tornado in Miyazaki and power went out in some places. It's worrying," he told AFP in Kyushu's main city Fukuoka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, I am away from my parents' home for the first time. So it's a bit scary being all alone," student Rio Ohtsuru, 19, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe I will look for a flashlight in case of a power outage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyushu's utility operator said that 254,610 houses were already without power elsewhere on the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The system was moving slowly, which often means more rain, with the weather office forecasting it to gradually rumble towards Japan's main island Honshu and the cities of Osaka and Nagoya, although this could change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned that "the risk of a disaster due to heavy rain can rapidly escalate in western Japan as Friday approaches."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Kagoshima, the JMA issued "special warnings of violent storms, high waves and high tides".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please exercise maximum vigilance against violent storms, high waves and high tides in Kagoshima, as well as landslides, flooding in low-lying areas and overflowing rivers in southern Kyushu," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For southern Kyushu, the JMA predicted an enormous 1,100 millimetres of precipitation in the 48 hours to Friday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain brought by Shanshan has been lashing large parts of Japan since Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three members of a family died after a landslide buried a house in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture, late Tuesday, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deceased included a couple in their 70s as well as a son in his 30s, while two adult daughters in their 40s survived with injuries, Kyodo News reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Auto giant Toyota has suspended production at all 14 of its factories in Japan. Nissan and Honda also decided to halt operations at their Kyushu plants, reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan Airlines has cancelled 275 domestic flights for Thursday, affecting 14,893 passengers, and an additional 13 for Friday that would have carried 1,307 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ANA scrapped 212 domestic flights slated for Thursday, affecting 18,700 passengers, and 42 Friday flights, affecting 4,200 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanshan comes in the wake of Typhoon Ampil, which disrupted hundreds of flights and trains this month. (AFP)

 Irish rider Eddie Dunbar produced a sparkling finish to claim the 11th stage of the Vuelta a España on Wednesday while three-time winner Primoz Roglic produced a late surge to chip away at Ben O'Connor's overall lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Team Jayco-AlUla's Dunbar spent much of the 166.5 kilometre route in a breakaway pack, suffering on the sharp hills with everyone else, only bursting clear 600 metres from the line in Padron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known as a climber, it was a surprise move from the 27-year-old Corkman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His rivals failed to pick him up until it was too late, allowing him to take his first ever stage victory in a grand tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a while since I've been in a scenario like this, if I'm honest," Dunbar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just kind of used my experience," he added. "I was suffering a bit on that steep climb, then I realised everyone else was."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Max Poole (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL) followed him across the line two seconds behind to complete the stage podium. (AFP)

 Romanian qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse bounced Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova from the second round of the US Open on Wednesday, beating the Czech 6-4, 7-5 to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have no words at this moment," said a beaming Ruse. "It's just a dream for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruse, ranked 122nd in the world, pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament so far with her win over the eighth-ranked Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech, eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Paris Olympics, opted not to play any hard-court tune-ups heading into the US Open, withdrawing from Toronto with a thigh injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She acknowledged before the tournament that obligations in the wake of her Wimbledon victory "took a lot of energy," although adding a second major after her 2021 French Open victory had boosted her confidence and sense of calm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the 26-year-old Ruse – who thanked her team for seeing her through a series of injuries – next faces 26th-seeded Paula Badosa of Spain, a 6-3, 7-5 winner over American Taylor Townsend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be honest right now, I just want to enjoy," said Ruse, who was especially pleased that her father, Adrian, was on hand to watch her play in the United States for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think my father is the lucky charm, for sure," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Paralympics opened in Paris on Wednesday in a colourful ceremony, kicking off 11 days of competition in a city still riding the wave of the successful Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Games open during a ceremony in a balmy Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,400 competitors from 168 delegations paraded into the venue as the sun set, greeting 30,000 spectators across the historic square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fine weather was in sharp contrast to the heavy rain which fell throughout the Olympics opening ceremony in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a symbol of inclusion, a mix of able-bodied and disabled dancers performed on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons then expressed his hope for an "inclusion revolution", before Macron officially declared the Games open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eighteen of the 35 Olympic venues - including the Grand Palais and the Stade de France - will be utilised again for the Paralympics, which run until September 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than two million of the 2.5 million tickets on sale have been snapped up, with several events sold out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, which won 96 golds at the last Paralympics in Tokyo, returns with 284 athletes, the most for any delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 126 males and 158 females will compete in 302 events over 19 sports, with 95 being first-time Paralympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China hopes to match their five-medal haul in Tokyo with a 23-strong delegation. Badminton star Daniel Chan and table tennis player Wong Ting-ting were the SAR's flag bearers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has sent a team of 140 athletes to compete in 17 sports, even as the war against Russian forces rages at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 100 athletes from Russia and Belarus will compete under a neutral banner, but they were barred from the ceremonies. (AP, Reuters, Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief of Telegram Pavel Durov on Wednesday was charged by the French judiciary with a litany of violations related to the messaging app but allowed to go free while being banned from leaving the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Durov was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros and on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remaining in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement following an hours-long hearing with two investigating magistrates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges concern alleged crimes involving an organised group including "complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable an illicit transaction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov has also been charged with refusing to share documents demanded by authorities as well as "dissemination in an organised group of images of minors in child pornography" as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said that the French judicial authorities had been made aware of the "near total absence of a response" from Telegram to requests from the authorities and had first opened an investigation in February 2024. (AFP)

 US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, as traders looked ahead to earnings results from US chipmaking giant Nvidia after the closing bell.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished the day down 0.4 percent at 41,091, and the S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent to 5,592.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq closed down more than 1.1 percent at 17,556.

  "Over the past couple of weeks, Nvidia has been rising, with the anticipation being that the company is going to do better than expectations," said Ventura Wealth Management's Tom Cahill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the bar is so high that it's not hard to imagine them saying growth is going to slow even just a little bit," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That would be very negative for the stock and therefore technology stocks in the market. There's a little apprehension."
  <br/>

  Nvidia's share price closed down 2.1 percent ahead of its earnings results.

    UK's Starmer promises 'reset' on Germany trip

    <![CDATA[<img alt="UK PM Keir Starmer's Labour Party has said it would seek a security and defence treaty with Olaf Scholz's Germany as part of a wider push to mend ties with the EU. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768063_1_20240829014505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on a visit to Berlin on Wednesday that a planned new treaty with Germany was part of his nation's push to mend EU ties damaged by Brexit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move toward a reset, welcomed by German leader Olaf Scholz, will also include the British premier travelling to Paris for talks with President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said the proposed accord, set to include a defence agreement and deeper links on science, technology as well as trade, was hoped to be agreed by year's end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British premier called the planned treaty a "once in a generation chance" to aid a "wider reset" in UK-EU ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz welcomed his UK counterpart's desire for a "reset," adding: "We want to accept this outstretched hand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour had said it would seek a security and defence treaty with Germany if it won the July 4 general election, which it did by a landslide – propelling Starmer to the premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's host Scholz has been under pressure to crack down on illegal migration after a suspected Islamist knife attack in the western city of Solingen on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stabbing, which left three people dead and eight injured, was allegedly carried out by a 26-year-old Syrian man who evaded attempts by German authorities to deport him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's premiership has faced an early challenge after a deadly knife attack in Southport last month sparked anti-immigration riots, which officials say were stoked by far-right elements and false information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said that he and Scholz had "agreed to develop a joint action plan to tackle illegal migration" and "smash the smuggler gangs who perpetrate this vile trade."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair also discussed the war in Ukraine, with both countries under pressure over their aid for Kyiv to help it fight off Russia's assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz insisted that both countries "stand firm at Ukraine's side," despite "recent attempts to sow doubt about this commitment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our resolve is as ever to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine to provide the support that it needs for as long as it needs," Starmer added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv's Western allies have reacted cautiously to Ukraine's recent incursion into Kursk, worried that their weapons could be used on Russian soil, possibly sparking a strong reaction from Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain allows Kyiv to deploy a squadron of 14 British-made Challenger 2 tanks as it sees fit, but has put limits on the use of its long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said on Wednesday that "no new decisions have been taken" in terms relating to tactical questions on the use of weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has repeatedly refused to send Kyiv its long-range Taurus missiles, over fears of escalating the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has been the second-largest contributor of aid to Ukraine after the United States, but plans to halve the budget for that aid next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Where Germany spent around eight billion euros (US$9 billion) on aid for Ukraine in 2024, the latest draft earmarks around four billion euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a European Political Community (EPC) summit in England two weeks after his election win, Starmer told European leaders the UK would be a "friend and partner" to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has ruled out rejoining the European single market, customs union or freedom of movement – to avoid reopening what remains a thorny issue among British politicians and the public alike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he does want to negotiate a new security pact with the bloc and a veterinary agreement to ease border checks on agricultural foods, as well as an improved trading deal. (AFP)

    Tens of millions bake under extreme heat in eastern US

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 million people were sweltering under heat alerts on Wednesday as a late-summer surge of extreme temperatures blanketed much of the eastern half of the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Record heat was expected to impact the mid-Atlantic states with temperature highs of around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) in and around the capital Washington, the National Weather Service said, though the heat wave was expected to be short-lived as a cooler and damper front moves in from Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys will feel a couple more days of high temperatures topping into the upper 90s at the hottest locations," added NWS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Baltimore, the mayor's office issued a "code red extreme heat alert" and posted on X the locations of five cooling centres opened to support the city's homeless population. Authorities were also distributing cold water to those without shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advised people who are outdoors in regions where the heat threat is considered "major" to stay in the shade, take breaks, and confine their activities to the coolest parts of the day or evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also important to carry a bottle of water, limit intake of caffeine, and monitor urine colour for signs of dehydration, the agency advised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate change has been extending the heat season across much of the United States, increasing both the frequency and intensity of heat waves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the US, even though heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable through outreach and intervention, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association found heat-related mortality rates in the United States increased between 1999 and 2023, especially during the last seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the true number of heat-related deaths is probably still being underestimated, the authors wrote, due to potential misclassification of causes of death and a lack of data on vulnerable populations. (AFP)

    Pope says repelling, abandoning migrants a 'grave sin'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis condemned on Wednesday efforts to repel migrants and block their routes as a "grave sin," as he recalled those who lost their lives, including those "abandoned" in the desert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 87-year-old regularly calls for more empathy for people fleeing conflict, poverty, disasters or persecution, particularly those seeking to reach Europe from Africa across the Mediterranean Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dedicated his address at his weekly audience on Wednesday to the subject, warning against "restrictive laws" and the "militarisation of borders" and calling for safe migration routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It must be said clearly: there are those who work systematically and with every means possible to repel migrants. And this, when done with awareness and responsibility, is a grave sin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He repeated that the Mediterranean – where more than 3,000 migrants went missing last year, according to UN figures – has become a "cemetery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some deserts too, unfortunately, are becoming cemeteries of migrants. And even here it is not always a question of 'natural' deaths. No," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At times, they have been taken to the desert and abandoned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the time of satellites and drones, there are migrant men, women and children that no-one must see. Only God sees them and hears their cry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not specify any particular country but said that his description of seas and deserts also includes oceans, lakes and rivers, as well as forests, jungles and steppes "where migrants walk alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Brothers and sisters, we can all agree on one thing: migrants should not be in those seas and in those lethal deserts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it is not through more restrictive laws, it is not with the militarisation of borders, it is not with rejection that we will obtain this result," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called for "safe and legal" routes for migrants and asylum seekers, and greater international efforts to combat human trafficking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union admitted in May to a "difficult situation" after a journalism consortium said Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania were dumping migrants in the desert, using the bloc's funds.
  <br/>

  The 27-nation EU has struck deals with the three countries with explicit financing to boost stopping irregular migration to Europe. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks mostly ticked lower on Wednesday, as investors await chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report after the closing bell.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 15 minutes into trading, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,616, while the tech-rich Nasdaq slumped 0.5 percent to 17,674.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones was flat at 41,232.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The focus on chip titan Nvidia comes as markets try to gauge the health of the tech and AI sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has seen profits surge thanks to demand for its GPU chips, which have set the industry's pace in pushing new AI advances – making it an indicator for the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia shares slid 1.4 percent in early trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Nvidia, traders will also be monitoring an update to US second quarter GDP growth on Thursday and data on the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation gauge on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a US central bank rate cut is widely expected in September, upcoming economic indicators are watched for their potential bearing on how big the reductions could go.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD reported a 32.8 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, its fastest growth since the end of 2023, despite faltering spending on big-ticket items in the world's largest car market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Net profit hit 9.1 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion) in the April-June quarter, while revenue was up 25.9 percent from a year earlier at 176.2 billion yuan, it said in a stock exchange filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first half of 2024, net profit jumped 24.4 percent to 13.6 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has taken a significant lead in the electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sector, leveraging its vertical integration strategy by using key components such as batteries made by the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has outsold the combined sales of Volkswagen's two joint ventures in China by 14.5 percent in the first seven months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to unseat Tesla as the largest EV vendor this year with a 17.7 percent share of the global market, versus Tesla's 17.2 percent, according to analysts' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been offering aggressive discounts for its best-selling Dynasty and Ocean series of EVs to secure its leadership position with a more than one-third share in China's new energy vehicle market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has also expanded its international presence, such as in Europe and Mexico, where it has plans to set up manufacturing facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company is facing a 17 percent additional tariff for exporting EVs from China to countries in the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overseas shipments accounted for 11.9 percent of BYD's total car sales in the first seven months of the year, nearly double the number for the same period last year, according to calculations based on BYD's monthly data. (Reuters)

    HKMA launches digital currency sandbox

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said he is pleased to see financial institutions expressing great interest in experimenting with wCBDC. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768015_1_20240828172547.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched an initiative that allows financial institutions to experiment with the use of its wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) in a controlled space.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The digital currency was introduced in March with the purpose of letting financial institutions settle interbank payments and trades faster and easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Project Ensemble Sandbox provides a virtual environment in which financial institutions can look at how to use digital currencies in various scenarios, with no risk of affecting the real-world market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said he is pleased to see financial institutions expressing great interest in experimenting with wCBDC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the launch of the sandbox is the city’s first step towards harnessing blockchain technology and smart contracts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see the sandbox as a pioneering financial infrastructure and also a collaborative platform to test and refine different use cases, covering areas ranging from fixed income and investment funds, liquidity management, green and sustainable finance to trade and supply chain financing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But the potential of the sandbox extends far beyond these initial applications. It is designed in a way that will enable it to support various forms of digital money and digital assets and ensure seamless integration with other infrastructure in the future.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said he hopes the pilot use cases would help set industry benchmarks for tokenisation in Hong Kong, as well as offer solutions to pain points in the real economy, including supply chain finance and cross-border payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Julia Leung, said the financial regulator fully supports HKMA's project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the SFC has been ahead of the game in providing guidance to the industry on the use of tokenised securities, as well as allowing the launch of investment funds in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are among the first to set clear regulatory expectations in these areas… These pilots have demonstrated cost savings and efficiency gains in the different phases of the product lifecycle, but they also point to the hurdles in reaping the full benefits of on-chain primary issuance, secondary market trading, custody, and hypothecation during the full product lifecycle. This is where today's sandbox comes in,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung added that the SFC is aware of hurdles the industry participants may face as they pilot test different use scenarios in the sandbox and assured them that the SFC will work closely with the HKMA to provide guidance and address concerns that arise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representatives from six sandbox participants – Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Hong Kong, HashKey Group and Ant Digital Technologies – also attended the ceremony and spoke about their individual plans for the sandbox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA said it will hold regular meetings with the financial institutions and the SFC to review the sandbox candidates' readiness to operate in the live market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA deputy chief executive Howard Lee said there is no specific timetable or expected duration for the sandbox programme, saying some cases may reach maturity in two to three months, while others may take longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say it would depend on individual cases and what kind of activities they are going to touch upon. If they are talking about tokenised bond this is a pretty mature financial product … that would be more ready to be transferred to the real life environment using different settlement methods or even tokenised deposit to do it… But for those who are a little bit less familiar and they might require more discussion with HKMA, with SFC, then these projects might need a little bit more time,” he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched raids on Wednesday across the occupied West Bank, where its forces killed at least nine Palestinians and sealed off the volatile city of Jenin, according to Palestinian officials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jewish state has carried out near-daily raids across the West Bank since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the ongoing war there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militant groups said they were exchanging fire with the Israeli military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governor of Jenin, Kamal Abu al-Rub, said on Palestinian radio that Israeli forces had surrounded the city, blocking exit and entry points and access to hospitals, and ripping up infrastructure in the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said Israeli forces had blocked the roads leading to a hospital with dirt barriers and surrounded other medical facilities in Jenin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military confirmed it was operating in the cities of Jenin and Tulkarem but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz drew comparisons with Gaza and called for similar measures in the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must deal with the threat just as we deal with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and whatever steps might be required. This is a war in every respect, and we must win it," he wrote on the platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank to rise up, saying the raids are part of a larger plan to expand the war in Gaza and blaming the escalation on US support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 652 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli fire since the war in Gaza began over 10 months ago, according to the Palestinian ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most have died during such raids, which often trigger gun battles with militants. (AP)

    English coach Ashley Westwood named HK boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="English coach Ashley Westwood named HK boss" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768006_1_20240828164544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former English Premier League ace Ashley Westwood was on Wednesday named as the new head coach of the Hong Kong, China men's football team.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Westwood has signed a two-year contract and will get to know his squad at a tri-nations tournament in Fiji next month, though interim coach Wolfgang Luisser will take charge of the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood most recently led Afghanistan's national team, and he's also coached in England and managed in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says his goal is to take Hong Kong to the Asian Cup finals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think first and foremost we'll set a good culture and we will make sure the environment that we bring them into is one that they'll want to play, they'll want to come and learn, they'll want to come and improve. I don't have any reservations about the quality in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I've played here before with my Indian sides, I've seen their standard. I think there's good players here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood started his career in the Manchester United academy and played more than 400 senior games in English football for the likes of Crewe, Sheffield Wednesday and Wrexham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most notably, he was part of the Bradford City team that made it to the English Premier League for the first time in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood turned to coaching after his retirement, working for English clubs before switching to Asia, claiming a league title with Bengalaru in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll take charge of the Hong Kong, China team for the first time in a friendly match against Liechtenstein on October 10 in Vaduz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former coach Jørn Andersen left the SAR in May, later taking up an appointment with a team on the mainland. In January, he led the team to the Asian Cup finals for the first time since 1968.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Football Association of Hong Kong, China also announced a HK$500,000 initiative to promote football refereeing, in the hope SAR referees will officiate in international competitions in the future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan issued an emergency warning on Wednesday as powerful Typhoon Shanshan approached the southwestern region with heavy rain and strong winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines and rail operators cancelled some services over the coming days as the typhoon, categorised as "very strong", packed strong winds and gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maximum caution is required given that forecasts are for strong winds, high waves and high tides that have not been seen thus far," the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanshan is expected to strike the southwestern Kyushu island over the next few days and approach the central and eastern regions, which includes the capital Tokyo, around the weekend, JMA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities issued evacuation orders for more than 800,000 residents in Kagoshima prefecture in Kyushu and the central Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two people were missing after a landslide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A wall of mud, rocks and other debris on Tuesday swept away a house in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture. Three others had been pulled out, according to public broadcaster NHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The typhoon also prompted Toyota Motor to suspend operations at all of its domestic factories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 28 production lines at 14 group companies will suspend operations from Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoon Shanshan is the latest storm to hit Japan following last week's Typhoon Ampil, which also led to blackouts and evacuations. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of protesters clashed in India's eastern city of Kolkata on Wednesday as demonstrations seeking justice for a murdered doctor spiralled into violent street skirmishes between political rivals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's body at a state-run hospital in Kolkata on August 9 stoked nationwide anger over the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sparked strikes by medics and rallies backed by thousands of ordinary citizens across India, although many doctors have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But repeated protests in West Bengal state capital Kolkata have transformed into clashes between the state's ruling All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and holds power nationally, but sits in opposition in West Bengal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want justice", BJP supporters chanted, referring to the murdered doctor, then demanding the resignation of AITMC leader Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Go back! Go back!" AITMC supporters shouted in return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, police clashed with protesters, firing tear gas canisters and water cannons, and arresting at least 245 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That prompted BJP supporters on Wednesday to launch a day-long shutdown of Kolkata, with skirmishes against AITMC supporters in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters erected barricades to close roads and railway lines, with police reporting clashes between rival workers across the city and in adjoining districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained for the murder, but Banerjee's government has faced public criticism for the handling of the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Supreme Court has ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the "horrific" killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation". (AFP)

    Trump faces revised indictment in 2020 election case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Special counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment against Donald Trump over his alleged efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump faced a revised federal indictment on Tuesday accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, with prosecutors narrowing their approach after a US Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith's team obtained the superseding indictment in the Washington case, though it was highly unlikely to proceed to trial ahead of the November 5 election when Trump faces his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised indictment lays out the same four charges prosecutors brought against the former president last year, but this one focuses on Trump's role as a political candidate seeking re-election, rather than as the president at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that Trump is at least presumptively immune from criminal prosecution for actions that were within his constitutional powers as president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington was expected to decide in coming weeks which aspects of the case must be tossed out based on the Supreme Court's immunity decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump in a statement on his Truth Social media platform said the Supreme Court's immunity ruling should lead to the entire case being thrown out, saying, "Smith rewrote the exact same case in an effort to circumvent the Supreme Court Decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, denouncing this case and the others he faces as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls have shown Harris opening up a narrow national lead over Trump since President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This indictment, like the initial one, accuses Trump of a multi-part conspiracy to block the certification of his election defeat to Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It retains allegations Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to use his role presiding over the congressional certification of the election on January 6, 2021, to reject electoral votes from battleground states Trump lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on that January 6 in an attempt to halt the congressional certification, which remains part of the case against Trump. (Reuters)

    Ng Tung River may be home to endangered Eurasian otter

<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation experts are urging people to keep an eye out next time they're walking by a river, as they may catch a rare glimpse of an endangered Eurasian otter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Researchers from the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden on Wednesday said they have found traces of the mammals' faeces by the Ng Tung River near Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said that previously, signs of the creature had only been found in remote areas, and this discovery proves that they can live close to urban districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Jianhuan, Conservation Manager of Kadoorie Conservation China, said this is the first time the farm has found signs of the animals in rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new finding in the Ng Tung River is also very important because previously the otters recorded in Hong Kong were mainly in mangrove forests and the fish pond areas, and this is the record that proves the otter can inhabit the water channels close to urban areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the expert warned that planned developments for the Northern Metropolis could threaten the otters' habitats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are not mountain species, they don't live in the country parks. They live in low land and much of their habitats are unprotected and under severe human disturbance... and all these lowland wetlands are right within the Northern Metropolis area," Yang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that if people do manage to spot one of the otters, they should leave it alone and contact the organisation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's former top court judge, Sam Hou-fai, on Wednesday formally declared his intention to run for the post of chief executive in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Sam resigned as president of the Court of Final Appeal to pave the way for his leadership bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Macau Science Centre, Sam said if elected, he would firmly implement the principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and make government more efficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also vowed to safeguard Macau's long-term stability and prosperity, and create a better future for the gambling hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The international environment has been changing and developing rapidly. In the past few years, it has brought challenges to the development of our country, and to our small special administrative region, the Macau SAR," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must reform and innovate to solve the difficulties in the development process, and mitigate the negative effects of some development bottlenecks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam said he will start getting in touch with the 400 election committee members on Thursday, when nominations open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefuls need to secure at least 66 nominations in order to run in the poll slated for October 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to reporters' questions in Portuguese, Sam also pledged to preserve the Macanese culture and the Portuguese language.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 25 years since the handover, the Macanese community has actively participated in various fields such as politics, economy, culture, professional sectors, and education in Macau. They have made important contributions to the successful implementation and development of 'One Country, Two Systems' with unique characteristics in our SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These contributions are evident for everyone. The Macanese community, including the Macanese people and the Portuguese language as an official language, is a distinctive and important feature of our Macau SAR that's not found elsewhere."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam, 62, became a lawyer on the mainland before moving to Macau in 1986. He went to Portugal to study in 1990 and returned to the casino hub three years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became a judge in 1997 and was appointed president of Macau's Court of Final Appeal in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He tried major cases during his tenure, including the corruption trial of former transport and public works chief Ao Man-long, who was sentenced to 29 years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If elected, Sam would be the first Macau CE without a business background.

    Home prices fall again, rents hit near 5-year highs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Home prices have dropped for the third consecutive month after a brief rebound earlier in the year. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767962_1_20240828124857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures showed home prices in Hong Kong continued to fall last month, whereas rents reached their highest in nearly five years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to data from the Rating and Valuation Department, private flats were 1.9 percent cheaper in July than the month before, marking the third consecutive month of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home prices briefly rose after the government scrapped all market-cooling measures in February, before the downward trend resumed in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, prices were down by 4.7 percent year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have said sales may pick up after interest rates start to fall, with the US Federal Reserve indicating that it will begin reducing borrowing costs in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, strong demand pushed rents up by 1.1 percent last month from June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That raised private sector rents to their highest levels since October 2019.
