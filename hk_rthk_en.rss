<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Jhon Duran scored two late goals as Aston Villa fought back to salvage a 3-3 home draw with Liverpool on Monday and take a significant step towards a place in the Champions League next season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A match that started with Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez conceding a shocking second minute own-goal turned into a thriller with Duran coming on to save the night with goals in the 85th and 88th minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are now on 68 points with one game remaining, five clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur who have two matches still to come.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool were gifted the opener when Argentine international Martinez fumbled a tame Harvey Elliot cross, desperately clawing the ball across the line and into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa, who would have secured fourth place with a win and must now wait for Tottenham's home game against title-chasers Manchester City on Tuesday, equalised 10 minutes later through Youri Tielemans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cody Gakpo made it 2-1 to the third-placed visitors in the 23rd, after a VAR check for offside, and Jarell Quansah then headed in off the post from a free kick for his first Premier League goal in the 48th. (Reuters)

    US market pauses ahead of key inflation figure

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A revival in GameStop and other meme stocks overshadowed a mixed performance in the broader stock market on Monday as a Dow winning streak ended.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Art Hogan, from B. Riley Financial, said the markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's consumer price index report for April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market will celebrate signs of moderating inflation, Hogan said, while further signs of intensifying inflation will lead to "the kind of selling pressure that we saw in April."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 percent to 39,431, ending an eight-day winning streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was flat at 5,221, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 percent to 16,388.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's light schedule in terms of economic reports continued the sleepy tenor of last week, when stocks climbed on hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inflation report -- along with this week's retail sales data -- will inform expectations about US monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, GameStop rocketed 70.9 percent higher while AMC Entertainment surged 80.9 percent. Both benefited from the return to social media of "Roaring Kitty," whose posts helped ignite a massive rally in a handful of stocks in January 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple jumped 1.8 percent following a Bloomberg report that the smartphone giant is close to a deal with OpenAI to add ChatGPT to iPhones. (AFP)

    Cohen testifies against former boss in New York

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Michael Cohen, the star prosecution witness in the criminal trial of Donald Trump walks to court to testify. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753032_1_20240514004135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's one-time fixer and the star prosecution witness in the former president's historic criminal trial testified Monday that he lied and bullied for his former boss who looked on silently.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Michael Cohen's testimony followed last week's court proceedings in which adult film star Stormy Daniels gave toe-curling detail about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump which is at the heart of the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer Cohen for a hush-money payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, when the story could have proved politically fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if, as a lawyer-fixer for the property tycoon, he lied and bullied people on behalf of Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes... It was what was needed in order to accomplish the task," said Cohen who periodically glanced over at Trump who was slouched in his chair at the defendant's table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen spent just over 13 months in jail and a year and a half under house arrest after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for lying to Congress and financial crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first weeks of the trial in New York, jurors have heard from witnesses that Cohen was a difficult character who cajoled others to get his way, while the defence counsel have painted him as a pathological liar and convicted criminal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen testified on Monday that he worked on both personal and corporate issues for Trump, who he claimed did not have an email address for fear of leaving a paper trial that could be used to prosecute him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006, has denied she threatened him if he did not buy her silence for US$130,000, a payment that prosecutors say Trump then covered up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial is taking place six months before the November election, when Trump will try to defeat Democratic President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During nearly eight hours over two days last week, Daniels walked the jury through the one-night stand she said she had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, and then the financial settlement she says ensued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump had sat impassively for much of Daniels's testimony, apparently cursing at times, and railing against proceedings in his comments to reporters as he entered and left the Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has denied having sex with Daniels, and his lawyers asked the judge for a mistrial on the grounds her testimony was "extremely prejudicial" in what is essentially a financial records and election-related case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Juan Merchan denied two mistrial requests last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan has imposed a gag order on Trump prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, and the ex-president -- who has traded insults with Daniels for years, calling her "horseface" and other crude slurs -- has not commented directly on her testimony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump spoke at a rally on a beach in New Jersey on Saturday and condemned the judge as "conflicted" and the prosecutor in the case, Alvin Bragg, as a "radical Democrat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he appeared to heed the gag order and avoided naming any witnesses in the case, including Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has also been charged in Florida with allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House but that case has been postponed indefinitely. (AFP)

    Banks 'light the flame of the climate crisis'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Public concern over climate change has grown over recent years, but a new report says banks are still funding fossil fuels. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753031_1_20240514003047.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's biggest banks financed fossil fuels to the tune of US$705 billion in 2023, with US and Japanese lenders leading the way, an annual report by climate campaigners said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the top 60 banks have provided a total of US$6.9 trillion to the sector, according to the coalition's 15th annual report titled "Banking on Climate Chaos".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis," said Tom BK Goldtooth, executive director of Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the report's authors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year's fossil fuel funding was down 9.5 percent from 2022, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some banks increased their exposure to climate risk, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JPMorgan was the top financier last year, providing US$41 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from 2022, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's Mizuho moved up to second place with US$37 billion, followed by Bank of America at US$33.7 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As one of the world's largest financiers to both traditional and clean energy companies, we help power today's global economy," said a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson in response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe our data reflects our activities more comprehensively and accurately than estimates by third parties. Reflecting our strategy of supporting the build-out of zero-carbon power, we set a net-zero aligned Energy Mix target and will disclose a clean energy supply financing ratio." (AFP)

    Rishi Sunak defends beleaguered Tories' track record

    <![CDATA[<img a="" alt="British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he's " confident"="" consecutive="" fifth="" his="" in="" office.="" party="" photo:="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" reuters"="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753030_1_20240514002111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto" term="" win="" would=""/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted on Monday that his beleaguered governing Conservative party can win a general election despite polls consistently indicating the opposite, but refused to set a date for the vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunak mounted a defence of the Tories' 14 years in power and claimed that Britain would be less safe under Keir Starmer's Labour opposition, which is widely tipped to come back to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UK leader said he was "confident" his party would win a fifth consecutive term but conceded that Labour, out of government since 2010, may ultimately inflict defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm clear-eyed enough to admit that, yes, maybe they can depress their way to victory," Sunak said in a speech in central London, accusing Labour of "scaremongering" and "gaslighting".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't think it will work because at heart we are a nation of optimists," he added, before warning of several dangers himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak cited Russia's war in Europe, Iran's firing of missiles in the Middle East and the uncertainty posed by artificial intelligence as threats that needed to be tackled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also referred to "authoritarian" states, including and North Korea, Scottish nationalists who want to break away from the United Kingdom and "cancel culture".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our country stands at a crossroads," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous, yet most transformational, our country has ever known," Sunak added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak's speech at the right-wing Policy Exchange think-tank is a clear pre-election pitch to voters, as Labour increasingly puts flesh on the bones of its policies before a manifesto launch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its repeated attacks on Starmer also gave an indication of a potentially bitter and personal election battle ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Sunak refused again to be drawn on when he would call the vote, repeating his well-trodden line that he was aiming for the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He can go to the polls no later than January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour has enjoyed double-digit leads over the Tories in surveys since the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss that ended in October 2022, and inflicted heavy losses on the Conservatives in local elections earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition -- overhauled since Starmer took over in the aftermath of Boris Johnson's election landslide for the Conservatives in 2019 -- has pledged to run the economy responsibly and hopes to match Sunak's recent pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the prime minister argued that only his party can protect Britons' safety and financial security, even after a decline in defence spending from 2010 to 2016 and the financial meltdown caused by Truss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are storms ahead. The dangers are all too real," said Sunak, a former finance minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But Britain can feel proud again. Britain can feel confident again. Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about Sunak's speech, Starmer said security would be the "first priority" of a Labour administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the choice at the ballot box would be between "a changed Labour Party that puts the country first and party second" and "the chaos and division" of the Conservatives. (AFP)

    Swiatek shrugs off climate protests at Rome Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Poland's Iga Swiatek signs autographs after winning her round of 16 match against Germany's Angelique Kerber. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753029_1_20240514001701.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iga Swiatek saw off Angelique Kerber 7-5, 6-3 at the Rome Open on Monday to set up a quarter-final clash with Madison Keys, who came through against Sorana Cirstea despite her match being interrupted by climate activists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number one Swiatek is yet to drop a set and is favourite for a third Foro Italico crown before she begins her French Open title defence later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time Roland Garros champion arrived in the Italian capital off the back of a thrilling triumph in Madrid, her third WTA 1000 title of the season after also winning at Indian Wells and Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 22-year-old didn't have it all her own way against former world number one Kerber, a three-time former Grand Slam champion who at 331st was the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the last 16 in this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek battled to the first set in just under an hour and was frequently put to the test by 36-year-old German Kerber, who fell behind after saving five set points in game 10 and then succumbing two games later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kerber went two ahead in the second set but Swiatek fought back and after the Pole broke serve in game eight she held steady to close out the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek will face Keys whose 6-2, 6-1 win was suspended for half an hour by a court invasion from activists from Ultima Generazione (Last Generation).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wearing orange vests, protestors threw a liquid and confetti onto the Pietrangeli court, where Keys was playing, and court 12 where a men's doubles match was taking place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also protestors in the stands with a tournament spokesman telling AFP that at least one person had tried to glue their feet to the floor in order to slow their removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's not the greatest feeling when you're on court, your first reaction is kind of your own safety," said Keys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think maybe banning cementing glue from bags would be a start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's obviously something that's becoming more of an occurence and something that tournaments are going to have to figure out how to stop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniil Medvedev will continue his title defence against Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic with the men's tournament wide open following a series of big-name exits, the latest being fourth seed Andrey Rublev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rome is missing the world's top three men following Novak Djokovic's early elimination on Saturday, with Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz both withdrawing ahead of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Russian Rublev, fresh from claiming the Madrid title, suffered a shock third-round defeat by French qualifier Alexandre Muller, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixth seed and reigning Monte Carlo champion Stefanos Tsitsipas is still in the fray after beating Briton Cameron Norrie in straight sets 6-2, 7-6 (7/1).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naomi Osaka's return to the Rome Open was ended at the last 16 by China's Zheng Qinwen who breezed past her four-time Grand Slam winning opponent 6-2, 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with third seed Coco Gauff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's Osaka, who has never won a title on clay, was playing at the Foro Italico for the first time in three years after taking a break from the tour to have her first child and is ranked at 173 in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I'm happy with my performance in Rome. It's been a while since I played well on -- I guess I've never played well on clay -- so I guess I'm happy," Osaka told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka will face Elina Svitolina for the first time since their handshake row at last year's French Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belarusian second seed Sabalenka was accused by Ukraine's Svitolina of inflaming tensions surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war after the Roland Garros quarter-final between the pair in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka waited at the net for a handshake after beating Svitolina, even though Svitolina had already insisted she was not going to offer one, as all Ukraine players refused to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian rivals in protest at the ongoing war. (AFP)

 Australian mining giant BHP announced on Monday that British rival Anglo American has rejected an "improved" takeover bid worth 34 billion (almost HK$333.5 billion).
 <br>
  <br/>
  BHP's latest offer, which aims to create the world's biggest-listed copper producer, comes after its initial £31.1-billion approach had already been rebuffed last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The revised proposal was rejected by the Anglo American board on 13 May 2024. BHP is disappointed that the... board has chosen not to engage with BHP with respect to the revised proposal and the improved terms," the company said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new bid was pitched at £27.53 per share, up from £25.08 per share that had been slammed by Anglo as "highly unattractive" and "opportunistic" in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP has lifted the number of shares that would be given to Anglo investors under the improved terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it still plans to split off Anglo's platinum and iron ore subsidiaries in South Africa, with shares split between the British firm's shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP put forward a revised proposal to the Anglo American Board that we strongly believe would be a win-win for BHP and Anglo American shareholders," said BHP chief executive Mike Henry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are disappointed that this second proposal has been rejected," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest offer would increase Anglo's share of the new combined group to 16.6 percent, up from 14.8 percent previously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP and Anglo American are a strategic fit and the combination is a unique and compelling opportunity to unlock significant synergies by bringing together two highly complementary, world class businesses," added Henry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The combined business would have a leading portfolio of high-quality assets in copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal and BHP would bring its track record of operational excellence to maximise returns from these high-quality assets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-afternoon deals on the London stock market, Anglo American's share price slid 0.8 percent to £27.51, while BHP dipped 0.6 percent to £22.83. (AFP)

    Weightlifting body chair remarks unacceptable: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The culture, sports and tourism minister, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said it was unacceptable that repeated mistakes were made by the chairwoman of the city's weightlifting and powerlifting body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also called on Josephine Ip of the Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association to publicly address her mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unacceptable for the same mistakes to happen over and over. We hope that the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China can come up with a long-term solution so that similar incidents won't happen again," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because in both instances the chairwoman was at fault, she should explain to the public herself."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association had apologised for a remark made by Ip during a competition on May 6. The event featured competitors from 13 countries along with the SAR and Chinese Taipei, and Ip said it had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remark drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sports body explained the chairwoman made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence while giving a speech at the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On another occasion, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a "slip of the tongue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the administration would take appropriate action based on findings of the investigation to ensure people speaking on behalf of a sports association or the sector understood that every single word is very important.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, for its part, said it is reviewing the report submitted by the weightlifting and powerlifting body and would keep in contact with the government how to handle the matter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

 Police on Monday said they arrested 34 people for allegedly operating electric bikes and scooters without a licence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 19 and 69, were also charged with offences such as driving unlicensed vehicles and using them on pavements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers added that they seized 34 electric bikes and scooters in various areas in the New Territories, such as Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau, in a two-day operation last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, senior inspector Ngai Siu-Cheong reminded people not to use unlicensed electric vehicles on public roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anyone using unregistered and unlicensed electric vehicles on the road may be in violation of the Road Users' Code and other relevant laws. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty includes a fine of HK$10,000 and 12-month imprisonment," he said.

    Take care of ethnic minority Chinese tourists too: DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's tourism industry should learn to be more accommodating to ethnic minority travellers from the mainland, DAB lawmakers said on Monday, after the central government announced it was adding eight more cities to the individual visit scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From May 27, residents from eight more cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Kennedy Wong pointed out the expansion meant more mainland visitors who are from ethnic minority communities coming to Hong Kong, including Mongolians, Zhuang people, and Hui people, and that the SAR had to be prepared to welcome them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's tourism industry, and actually every one of us here, should be more accommodating and should be more understanding towards the minority travellers' needs. For example, for Muslims and for Mongolians, they have their eating habits and they also have their own culture," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of these minority travellers probably prefer their own languages. Apart from the ability to speak Putonghua, perhaps in some signage and some areas we also need to display their languages too."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, another DAB legislator and also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, urged officials to consider arranging more direct flights from those mainland cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are currently direct flights from just four of these newly added cities – Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also renewed calls for Beijing to raise the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan per person for each trip, while capping the amount at 200,000 yuan.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun said on Monday there was "nothing political" about him saying the governance of the statutory body overseeing social workers must be improved, and that the motivation was about raising the sector's professional standards.
 <br>
  <br>
   Last Friday, he wrote on social media accusing the Social Workers Registration Board of ignoring society's overall interests, damaging the professionalism and credibility of the sector by deviating from the spirit of the law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Specifically, he wrote that the board had renewed the licences or approved licence applications of people who'd committed serious offences in the past, while approving a social worker facing a rioting charge to join its disciplinary committee panel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said improvements must be made to implement the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, the board has 15 members - eight of whom are elected, with six appointed and an official from the Social Welfare Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Sun didn't say whether the government plans to appoint more members to the board.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it would announce its reform package once it's ready.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun also dismissed an argument from the board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, that the minister had misunderstandings regarding how the board operates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There's no misunderstanding - I have complete information about what's going on in the board," the minister said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said he hopes the board won't become a political battlefield.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tik said that if the government decides to go ahead and add more appointed members, he hoped it wouldn’t be because it wanted to gain the majority of the board and exert greater influence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lawmaker also proposed that future appointed members be nominated or recommended by universities or professional bodies as they'd be considered impartial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you want to improve the registration board, it has to include the element of professionalism," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I suggest that the scholars from the universities or members of the professional body would increase the content and element of professionalism. I also imagine it will be more easily accepted by our professional sector."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tik hoped that officials would consult social workers regarding the reform proposal in future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indian citizens across 96 constituencies began casting their ballots on Monday as the country's gigantic, six-week-long election edges past its halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term with an eye on winning a supermajority in Parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday’s polling in the fourth round of multi-phase national elections across nine states and one union territory will be pivotal for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crucial seats in Maharashtra and Bihar states, where the BJP governs in alliances with regional parties, were also up for grabs in this phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Bihar’s Samastipur city, hundreds of voters lined up at a polling station that opened at 7am amid tight security arrangements. Voters said they were concerned about rising food prices, lack of employment and economic development in the state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and his BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million voters, more than 10 percent of the world’s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4. (AP)

    Community living rooms to open in summer: Chris Sun

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said he hopes the community living rooms in To Kwa Wan, Hung Hom and Nam Cheong would open by the end of the summer holidays, as part of efforts to help the newly identified 950,000 people for targeted poverty alleviation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legco panel meeting, Sun hoped the three facilities, aimed at providing support for grassroots families, would be able to serve residents in summer after undergoing outfitting works.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam asked whether there were plans to expand the shared-space project to more districts to help more people living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Apart from subdivided unit households, people living in cages or caged homes and cubicles also need these kind of community living rooms. There are a lot of such kinds of residential developments in Sha Tin, in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O, there are also subdivided units…Will the government expand the programme to other districts?” she asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said it’s not easy for the government to identify locations for these living rooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Subdivided unit households are concentrated in urban areas and as a result it's difficult for the government to identify a venue to establish a community living room. That is why we have to rely on the business sector to identify such a venue for us,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same meeting, lawmakers also questioned whether a new framework for poverty measurement could reflect the actual poverty situation and target underprivileged groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation. It will no longer use median household income to define poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said officials shouldn’t scrap the poverty line because it can keep the public informed about the impoverished population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course, the poverty line is contentious elsewhere in the world, but the poverty line works in two ways — we can tell the trend; we can see whether the impoverished population is growing or shrinking. The poverty line can also help us keep an eye on the performance of the government,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The welfare chief responded by saying the government had been putting a lot of resources into poverty alleviation through various social welfare programmes.

    Pro-Palestinian students walk out at US graduation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of students walked out of Duke University's commencement ceremony on Sunday to protest its guest speaker, comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who has supported Israel throughout the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 30 of the 7,000 students present left their seats, chanting “free Palestine” amid a mix of boos and cheers. Some waved the red, green, black and white Palestinian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos posted on social media also showed several attendees leaving the viewing stands, including a person wearing a keffiyeh, which can be an emblem of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others shouted "Jerry! Jerry!" as the actor received an honorary degree, and Seinfeld delivered his speech without major interruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late," he said, after vowing to "defend" the concept of privilege.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement," said Duke spokesperson Frank Tramble in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The walkout at Duke's graduation was the latest manifestation of protests that have roiled US campuses as students call for universities to divest from arms suppliers and other companies profiting from the war, and amnesty for students and faculty who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Emerson College in Boston, chants interrupted remarks by the school's president during its commencement ceremony on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students could be seen on a recording of the event walking across the stage to receive their degrees carried signs of their support for Palestinians, including one woman who unfurled a Palestinian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protests have prompted US universities such as Columbia in New York and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to cancel their main graduation ceremonies this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other colleges and universities have relocated or modified commencement ceremonies. (Agencies)

    Govt should clarify rules for FDH agencies: DAB

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Frankie Ngan (second left) says the revised code of practice for employment agencies is unclear.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday called on the government to clarify its revised rules on employment agencies, saying they were unclear.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party's comments came after the Labour Department released a revised code of practice last week which aims to discourage domestic helpers from "job hopping", and to safeguard consumer rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan urged authorities to better stipulate the measure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The DAB requests the government to do more promotion and education for the agencies, especially as it is a new regulation for them," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Could the government implement the instruction for the employer and the employee at the same time to make sure that they deeply understand the new regulation for the agency and the new agreement?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ngan also called on the government to limit the borrowing capacity of foreign domestic helpers, as he and other DAB party members have received complaints from employers who are frustrated by lenders who pursue the money that helpers failed to pay back before departing from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We request the government [to] make a financial credit database for those financial institutes to see [how much a] particular domestic helper borrowed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We request the government to consider, [to] set an upper limit for the borrowing loan to the domestic helpers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB also suggested the government introduce a tax reduction scheme for people hiring foreign domestic helpers to reduce their burden on arranging health checks and training classes for the helpers.

    Divided views on direct flights for mainland visitors
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Representatives of the retail and hotel industries on Monday praised the move to boost Hong Kong's tourism sector by adding eight mainland cities to the individual visit scheme, but views were divided on whether direct flights from those cities were necessary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From May 27, travellers from Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, Hohhot of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin in Heilongjiang, Lhasa in Tibet, Lanzhou in Gansu, Xining in Qinghai, Yinchuan in Ningxia, and Urumqi in Xinjiang will be able to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, there are direct flights from just four cities - Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Chan from the Miramar Group, which owns two hotels in the city, said travellers from further afield tend to spend more money, adding that tourists from the eight cities would be a big boost to the tourism sector here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Visitors from those eight places will be the most wealthy people there...there are rich people in every city. For example, Shanxi doesn't have a very strong economy but there are bosses who own coal businesses there," the group's chief operations officer told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said with a new road which links Shenzhen airport and Shenzhen Bay opening next month, it would be convenient for mainland travellers to come to the SAR even if there are no direct flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Liberal Party legislator Peter Shiu, who represents the retail sector, said businesses here would get a greater boost if there are direct flights from all eight cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If tourists fly to Hong Kong directly, they would spend the night here during their trip. But if they fly to Shenzhen first and then come to Hong Kong, will they spend some time in Shenzhen before visiting us, or come to Hong Kong during the day and spend the night in Shenzhen?" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to think about this because usually tourists who stay the night here spend more money than those who don't."

    All Blacks captain Cane to retire from internationals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Having played 95 Tests -- 27 as captain -- the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His retirement is not a complete surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks haven't played since they were defeated in the Rugby World Cup final by South Africa last year and Cane was already on a sabbatical in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane won the World Cup with New Zealand in 2015 and has twice been part of Super Rugby championship-winning sides with the Waikato Chiefs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his experience since taking over as All Blacks captain from Kieran Read in 2020 was not always smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane at times struggled with his own form and was sent off during last year's Rugby World Cup final in the 28th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With talents such as of Ardie Savea and Dalton Papalii snapping at his heels, there had been calls for him to be dropped from the side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his tenure New Zealand lost a first Test series at home to Ireland in 2022 and a few weeks later suffered a shock defeat to Argentina in Christchurch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane will return to New Zealand at the end of the current Japanese club season and will be eligible to be selected for the All Blacks for the rest of 2024, but will no longer be captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's part of the natural process that happens in rugby," Cane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had my time as captain and it was a huge honour and privilege." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian officials on Monday said the death toll from flash floods and mudslides in Western Sumatra had risen to at least 41 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams were still searching for another 17 people who remain missing, authorities added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain on Saturday evening caused flash floods, landslides, and cold lava flow, which is a mixture of volcanic ash, rock debris and water that flows like mud, in three districts in West Sumatra province, according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cold lava flow, known in Indonesia as a lahar, came from Mount Marapi, one of Sumatra's most active volcanoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said around 400 personnel, consisting of local rescuers, police, and military were deployed to search for the missing people on Monday, helped by excavators and drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rescue efforts that began on Sunday were complicated by damaged roads, making it difficult for rescuers to pass through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national disaster and management agency (BNPB) said almost 200 houses were damaged and 72 hectares of land, including rice fields, were affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 159 people had been evacuated to nearby school buildings, the BNPB said. (Reuters)

    Nuggets and Pacers win to level NBA playoff series

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The defending champion Denver Nuggets outgunned the Minnesota Timberwolves 115-107 to level their NBA playoff series on Sunday as the Indiana Pacers pulled even with the New York Knicks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets, fueled by 35 points from NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon's 27 points on ruthlessly efficient 11-of-12 shooting and 19 points from Jamal Murray, claimed a second straight win in Minneapolis to knot their best-of-seven Western Conference semi-final series at two games apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers dismantled the Knicks 121-89 in Indianapolis to level their Eastern Conference semi-final at 2-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets withstood a 44-point performance from Anthony Edwards, but the Timberwolves star just didn't have enough scoring support despite an energetic effort from the hosts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards' dunk with less than a minute left in the first half cut what had been a 16-point deficit to seven.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic then came up with a steal and fed Michael Porter Jr. for a dunk and Murray grabbed a steal, turned and unleashed a buzzer-beating shot from beyond the halfcourt line that swished through and sent the Nuggets into the break with a 64-49 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray scored 12 points in the third quarter to keep the Nuggets in control as early foul trouble sent Jokic to the bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic returned to score 16 in the fourth and the Nuggets kept the Timberwolves at bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indianapolis, the Pacers finally got their high-octane offence firing. After the first two games of the series came down to the final minutes the Pacers fashioned a blow-out as a raft of injuries at last caught up with the weary Knicks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 20 points and the Pacers connected on 56.8 percent of their shots, drilling 14 three-pointers and dominating in the paint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  T.J. McConnell scored 15 points off the bench for Indiana, who had six players score in double figures. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, began a week-long inspection trip in Macau on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xia inspected the construction site of a bridge and met Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and other officials at Macau Government House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Macau SAR Government earlier said Xia would learn more about the latest developments of the SAR's society and its economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Ho said officials would make necessary arrangements to ensure the success of Xia's inspection trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Macau was thankful for the long-standing support and concern of the central government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xia visited Hong Kong in February this year, meeting people in various sectors including those in the finance, business and legal professions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Zhizhen advanced to the fourth round of the ATP Rome Open after a convincing 6-2, 6-4 win over American Ben Shelton, on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang managed to save two break points and had four unforced errors compared to Shelton's 15, as he dispatched the 12th seed in 71 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ranked 56th globally, Zhang is set to face Brazilian qualifier Thiago Monteiro next. Monteiro progressed after a closely contested match against Serbia's 31st seed, Miomir Kecmanovic, winning 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 [6].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang's showing in Rome so far marks an improvement for the 27-year-old, who faced first-round exits in his previous two clay tournaments in Barcelona and Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Number 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany had a better day than Shelton. Zverev smashed 12 aces and advanced past Italy's Luciano Darderi 7-6 [3], 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also moving to the fourth round of the clay-court event was eighth-seeded Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, who defeated qualifier Terence Atmane of France 7-6 [3], 6-3 in one hour, 44 minutes. Dimitrov will be making his fourth appearance in the fourth round but first since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next up for Dimitrov will be 11th-seeded Taylor Fritz, who knocked out 24th-seeded Sebastian Korda 6-3, 6-4 in an All-American clash. (Xinhua/AFP)

    HA looks to make it easier to add new medicines

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) said it is seeking to streamline the process for adding new drugs to its registry, with a view to cut half the time needed to obtain the medicines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, drug companies write to clinical doctors directly in the application, and it takes around 10 months before a drug could be added to the HA's formulary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority’s cluster services director, Simon Tang, said officials are trying to cut the red tape by having companies write to its headquarters, saving front-line doctors time and effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said patient groups and public doctors are among stakeholders officials will speak to, saying he hopes they can work out a proposal in the coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to get our colleagues involved, and of course, another key stakeholder would be the pharmaceutical companies," Tang told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through the streamlining, we're confident that the introduction of new drugs to the HA drug formulary can be shortened by half."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In November last year, the government introduced a new mechanism called "1+" for new drug registrations, for products treating severe diseases that are backed by local clinical data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new drug can now be registered in the SAR if just one drug regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than the previous two authorities, before local experts and regulators approve it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the HA had so far asked drug companies to try to register two drugs for treating cancer through the new mechanism, and said he understood that the government itself had received around 100 enquiries on the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that if the safety-proving clinical data for the new product is from the mainland or Hong Kong that could better ensure its effectiveness, because sometimes drugs approved in other continents may not have similar effects or side-effects for Asians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The doctor noted that mainland drug regulators were one of four authorities added to the list of regulatory bodies in recent years.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland students studying in Hong Kong have been urged to be vigilant as more of them are being targeted by phone scammers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior inspector Eddie Lam said there were 39 cases of mainland students falling victim to fake-official ruses in the first quarter of this year, up from 29 cases during the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We discovered that scammers are targeting mainlanders who are studying in Hong Kong. We found that the number of reports by mainland students increased rapidly in April," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said students, especially those from the mainland, should be extra vigilant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From January to March, phone-scam victims lost a total of HK$789 million, almost four times more than the amount swindled during the same period last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Clashes reignited between the Sudanese army and rival paramilitaries earlier this week in the key Darfur town of El-Fasher, the United Nations said on Sunday, killing at least 27 people in one day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses have reported air strikes, artillery fire and machine gun clashes battering the city since Friday, when an hours-long battle left an estimated 850 people displaced, according to the UN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also killed at least 27 that day, based on what the UN said were "unconfirmed reports", as the city suffers a near-total communications blackout, with medics and human rights defenders barely able to get news to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighting has since continued, eyewitnesses said Sunday, reporting air strikes and artillery shelling that left "houses on fire", one resident told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to French medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), two children and a caregiver were killed in an intensive care unit Saturday following a nearby military air strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since April of last year, Sudan has been in the grips of a devastating war between the army, headed by the country's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  El-Fasher is the last major city in Darfur that is not under paramilitary control. The international community, including the UN and the United States, have for weeks warned against a looming offensive on the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MSF said Sunday that an air strike carried out by the army -- which maintains a functional monopoly on the skies -- landed 50 metres from the Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It caused the roof of the ICU to collapse, resulting in "the death of two children who remained receiving treatment there, as well as the death of at least one caregiver," according to a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The children who were killed were in a critical condition in our ICU, but their lives could have been saved," MSF's head of emergency operations Michel-Olivier Lacharite said. (AFP)

    Zhang stuns Sagstrom to win Founders Cup

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rose Zhang produced a scintillating late rally to sweep past Madelene Sagstrom and claim her second professional title with victory at the LPGA Founders Cup in New Jersey on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old from California rattled off four birdies in her final five holes to card a six-under par 66 to finish on 24-under, two shots clear of Sweden's Sagstrom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In cool, overcast conditions at the Upper Montclair Country Club in Clifton, overnight leader Sagstrom had looked to be cruising to victory after rolling in her fifth birdie of the day on the 12th to go three shots clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagstrom retained that hefty three-shot cushion after parring the 13th along with Zhang, who gave no clue of the pyrotechnics to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang pulled a shot back with a birdie on the par-five 14th, and then got to within one after a superb tee-shot set up a birdie chance on the par-three 15th which she converted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the pressure building, Sagstrom then cracked on the 16th, under-hitting a chip onto the green which left her a long par putt that she missed to card a bogey five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left Zhang as co-leader and the youngster duly seized her chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dazzling tee-shot on the par-three 17th left her a three-foot putt for birdie which she rolled in to move one shot clear, and then she sealed victory on 18 with a nerveless birdie putt from 10 feet. (AFP)

    Charm offensive as Xi ramps up 'people diplomacy'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan wave as they arrive at Belgrade Airport, the second stop of Xi's European tour. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752886_1_20240513054450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping’s latest trip to Europe was one of the signs that Beijing is ramping up "people-to-people" diplomacy to counter-balance trade tensions, as the president went on a charm offensive to boost economic ties with central and southeast Europe, according to a political commentator.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the president wrapped up his visit to France, Serbia and Hungary, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK that Xi also hoped to show Europe that what China had been doing over the past 10 years - including with the Belt and Road Initiative - "has been all trade and growth".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over 50 different agreements were signed between China and these three nations, covering all areas...," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What he’s doing is definitely people-to-people diplomacy, especially at the higher level, you could see very clearly that he had a very good rapport on a personal level with President Macron, as well as [the] leaders of both Hungary and Serbia, and he actually stayed an extra couple of hours in Serbia," Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi’s visit to the region, which was the first in five years, came at a critical time amid mounting trade pressure, with the European Union (EU) pressing ahead with investigations into China's critical sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and medical devices - in a bid to ease the bloc’s trade deficit with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told reporters after talks with Xi that the European Union was "ready to make full use of trade defence instruments" to defend European economies, but Tangen rejected this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overcapacity issue [raised] is completely false," Tangen commented. He said that when Europe and America dominated manufacturing worldwide, they attributed it to market competition and the natural superiority of their products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, as China is able to sell goods and services at a lower rate, all of a sudden it became 'why hasn’t China been watching out for Europe and the US?'" Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact is, these are developed dominant countries that cannot fulfil their own needs and desires from their own countries. If they weren't buying from China, they would be buying from somewhere else, [so] it’s not going to address their trade deficit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What the EU should really be concerned about is their competitiveness. What is the future of the EU?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With over half of the world's population heading to vote for new leaders of more than 80 nations over the course of 2024, Tangen expects trade tensions to continue in the short and medium term as policymakers court voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Really, communication is absolutely key," Tangen said. "And in the long term it is about people-to-people exchanges. It takes time and you have to be willing to wait and engage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Concentrating on sports and education, and bringing young people into the play. And this is a very long-term strategy by the Chinese government."

    Kremlin unveils military shakeup, new defence minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sergei Shoigu was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752884_1_20240513045138.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday moved to replace defence minister Sergei Shoigu in a major shake-up to Russia's military leadership more than two years into war with Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin proposed economist Andrey Belousov as Shoigu's replacement, according to a list of the ministerial nominations published by the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes at a key time in the conflict with Russian troops advancing in eastern Ukraine and having just launched a major new ground operation against the northeastern Kharkiv region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite a string of military setbacks in the first year of the campaign -- including the failure to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and retreats from the Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions -- Putin had stood by Shoigu until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That included when Wagner paramilitary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched a bloody insurrection last year calling for Shoigu's removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining the timing of the decision, the Kremlin said it needed the defence ministry to stay "innovative".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defence ministry must be absolutely open to innovation, to the introduction of all advanced ideas, to the creation of conditions for economic competitiveness," state media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying in a briefing on the appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The battlefield is won by whoever is more open to innovation," Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is likely why the president has settled on the candidacy of Andrey Belousov," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belousov, who has no military background, has been one of Putin's most influential economic advisers over the last decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoigu, 68, was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012 and has had a decades-long political career of unmatched longevity in post-Soviet Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His presence at the centre of power in Moscow pre-dates that of Putin himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to Russia launching its full-scale military campaign on Ukraine in February 2022, he was seen as one of Putin's most trusted lieutenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were regularly photographed on nature retreats in the Siberian wilderness, hunting and fishing together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one famous snap from 2017 shared by the Kremlin, they are sitting bare-chested under the sun on a beach by a lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Putin simultaneously issued decrees naming Shoigu as the new secretary of the Security Council, replacing his longstanding ally Nikolai Patrushev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin also said Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff, would stay in post overseeing daily military operations in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As for the military component, the appointment (of Belousov) will in no way change the current frame of reference," state media quoted Peskov as saying in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff. He will continue his activities, and no changes are envisaged there at the moment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Along with Shoigu, Gerasimov had been targeted by a hardcore group of influential pro-offensive military bloggers for Moscow's perceived military failures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prigozhin, who marched on Moscow calling for the pair's removal, died in a plane crash weeks after his aborted mutiny.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is constitutionally required to name a new set of government ministers -- or reappoint existing ones -- following his victory in a March election devoid of opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers in Russia's rubber-stamp parliament need to approve the president's nominations, which they are set to do over the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The future of Patrushev, an arch-hawk who is sometimes seen as a possible successor to Putin, was unclear.
  <br/>
  <br/>

    Retail workers at Apple store okay strike action

<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionized workers at a Maryland Apple store voted on Saturday to authorize a strike, which would mark the first such labour action against the retailer in the United States if it goes forward.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Employees at the Apple store in the town of Towson, near Baltimore, voted to unionise in 2022 -- another first for the iPhone maker's US stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a contract has yet to be agreed upon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following over a year of negotiations with Apple management that yielded unsatisfactory outcomes," union members are "signaling their collective demand for meaningful change," a union statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The issues at the forefront of this action include concerns over work-life balance, unpredictable scheduling practices disrupting personal lives, and wages failing to align with the area's cost of living."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Towson store has about 100 employees. A majority of them were required to vote for the result to be valid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next negotiation meeting is scheduled for May 21, though a strike could come before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, employees at another of the California-based company's stores, in New Jersey, voted down a unionisation effort over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement to CNN, Apple said it would "engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Labor Relations Board, the federal labour regulator, has received numerous complaints against Apple, accusing it of trying to discourage staff from unionising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US tech companies in general are seen as hostile toward unionisation efforts -- particularly Amazon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In September, nearly a quarter of Apple store employees in France went on strike the day the iPhone 15 launched, demanding a pay raise at least equal to inflation. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal kept their Premier League title dreams alive by ending an Old Trafford hoodoo to grind out a 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday to move back top of the table.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard scored the only goal on 20 minutes as Arsenal won for just the second time in 17 games away at United to go a point clear at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester City still have the destiny of the title in their own hands as the defending champions have two matches left to Arsenal's one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Gunners kept the pressure on Pep Guardiola's men ahead of their tricky trip to Tottenham on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat further dented United's chances of competing in Europe next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's men showed more spirit than in a dismal 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday, but have now won just one of their last eight Premier League games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United remain eighth in the table, three points adrift of both Newcastle, who they face on Wednesday, and Chelsea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have been in scintillating form in 2024 to remain in the race for their first league title in 20 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's men have won 15 and drawn one of their 17 league games since the turn of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Arsenal were far from their flowing best as the expected onslaught of an injury-ravaged United never materialised under unusually stifling heat in England's north-west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The manner of defeat at Palace had increased the scrutiny on United boss Ten Hag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made three changes to the team swept aside at Selhurst Park as Scott McTominay, Sofyan Amrabat and Amad Diallo came in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman's options were again hamstrung by a lengthy list of absentees with captain Bruno Fernandes among those sidelined and a bench littered with youngsters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his decision to retain Casemiro as a makeshift centre-back after his woeful showing against Palace will become another stick to beat the beleaguered coach with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazil captain was dropped from their squad for the Copa America in midweek due to his terrible form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After United had managed to keep the free-scoring visitors at bay for the opening 20 minutes, Casemiro was culpable for the opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old was laboured in pushing up from a United goal-kick to play Kai Havertz onside and Trossard then stole in on the blind side of Casemiro to tap in the German's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance at Old Trafford rather than at Wembley to see the club's women pick up their first ever major trophy in the FA Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The work that lies ahead of Ratcliffe has been laid bare in recent weeks, but the home side did manage to keep the majority of the 74,000 crowd onside by taking the game to Arsenal after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal, though, were rarely seriously troubled as they held out for a sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. (AFP)

    United crush Spurs to seize Women's FA Cup

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United won the Women's FA Cup for the first time with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Marc Skinner's side, who lost in last year's final to Chelsea, dominated the match and went ahead on the stroke of halftime through a stunning strike from midfielder Ella Toone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A header from Rachel Williams and two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia after the break sealed the first major trophy for United since the team reformed in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing," said goalkeeper Mary Earps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The atmosphere was buzzing on a sunny day at Wembley Stadium with 76,082 fans in attendance along with United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the first half produced few chances of note until the second minute of stoppage time when England's Toone drove the ball forward and unleashed a powerful strike from outside the area into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spurs, playing in their first FA Cup final, drew 2-2 with United in the Women's Super League last month but struggled to create any attacking threat, not registering a single shot on target, and capitulated after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's Williams, who previously played for Spurs and won the FA Cup with Birmingham City 12 years ago, climbed high to head in a free kick before Garcia pounced on a poor pass from goalkeeper Becky Spencer to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garcia added another via a deflection in the 74th as United salvaged a season in which they have struggled, sitting fifth in the league standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had," goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. "We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to have change things next year. We have had some injuries, three or four ACLs, at the start of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's football, teams go through transition. You have a good year, you have a dip. Next year we might just come back bigger, better and stronger and, who knows, we might just be lifting the league." (Reuters)

    Thai police swoop on record drug haul

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities intercepted a tonne of crystal methamphetamine in one of the kingdom's biggest ever single seizures of the illegal drug, police said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The haul, with an estimated value of more than US$25 million on the international market, was found when officers stopped a pickup truck in central Nakhon Nayok province on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting National Police Chief Kittharath Punpetch said police, military and local officials had been monitoring several smuggling gangs and learned of a plan to move a large amount of the drug, commonly known by the street name "ice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kittharath told a news conference that 40 bags of the drug, weighing a tonne in total, were found in the truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its driver was arrested but investigators believe the head of the smuggling network is a Thai national based in a neighbouring country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kingdom is a major transit route for illicit drugs produced in the so-called "Golden Triangle" region where northern Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar is a major source of amphetamine, much of it produced in illegal labs in border areas controlled by ethnic minority armed groups. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In March, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital transplanted a genetically edited pig kidney into a man suffering from end-stage kidney disease. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752871_1_20240512232441.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first living patient to receive a genetically modified pig kidney transplant has died two months after the procedure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mass General is deeply saddened at the sudden passing of Mr. Rick Slayman. We have no indication that it was the result of his recent transplant," the Boston hospital said in a statement issued late on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a world first, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in March successfully transplanted the genetically edited pig kidney into Slayman, who was 62 years old at the time and suffering from end-stage kidney disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation," the hospital statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organ shortages are a chronic problem around the world and Mass General said in March that there were more than 1,400 patients on its waiting list for a kidney transplant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pig kidney used for the transplant was provided by a Massachusetts biotech company called eGenesis and had been modified to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes, according to the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slayman, who suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had received a transplanted human kidney in 2018, but it began to fail five years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the hospital announced the successful transplant in March, Slayman said he had agreed to the procedure "not only as a way to help (him), but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on Mass General's website, his family said while they were "deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick" they took "great comfort knowing he inspired so many."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family said they were "comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 89,000 patients were on the national kidney waiting list as of March this year, according to a US health department website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On average, 17 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant. (AFP)

    Chiliean Alejandro Tabilo stuns Novak Djokovic

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic was knocked out of the Rome Open in the third round on Sunday by Alejandro Tabilo in a surprise 6-2, 6-3 defeat for the 24-time Grand Slam champion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title was ended in just over an hour by Chilean Tabilo, who is ranked 32nd in the world but was hugely impressive and claimed his first win over a top-10 opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old was eliminated two days after being accidentally being struck on the head by a bottle following his straightforward second-round win over Corentin Moutet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And his subdued performance on a court where he has won six titles suggested he may have still been suffering from that blow, even if he laughed it off by wearing a cycling crash helmet to practice on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic's early elimination is a blow for the last major tournament before Roland Garros later this month, which started without Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home fans have also been deprived of cheering on former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Musetti, while Djokovic's great clay-court rival Nadal, a big crowd favourite, was dumped out in the second round on Saturday by seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tabilo was a worthy winner after tearing into his superstar opponent, racing into a 4-0 lead in the first set in less than 20 minutes, breaking Djokovic twice and surprising the Serb with a series of impressive winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chilean claimed the opening set in half an hour, leaving fans sat under the baking Rome sunshine stunned at the off-form Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He immediately broke Djokovic for the third time in the opening game of the second set and went on to claim the biggest win of his career in remarkable style. (AFP)

    Thousands flee Rafah as Israel begins assault

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians have been fleeing Rafah, with many heading for Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Palestinian territory. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752868_1_20240512222932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 War-weary Gazans flooded towards coastal areas of the Gaza Strip's southern city of Rafah on Sunday, fleeing heavy bombardment in eastern zones after Israel ordered them to evacuate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We endured three days that can be considered hell," said Mohammed Hamad, a 24-year-old resident of eastern Rafah who was among the 300,000 Palestinians that Israel says have fled the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite international opposition to any major military operation in Rafah, Israel has shifted its focus to the heavily populated area in what it says is an effort to destroy the last bastion of Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern parts of the city have been heavily bombarded in recent days, according to witnesses, as Israel sent tanks and ground troops into the areas in "targeted raids".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were among the worst nights for us since the beginning of the war," Hamad told AFP from Al-Mawasi, an area Israel has designated a "humanitarian zone" despite aid groups warning that it is unprepared for such an influx.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rafah's population had swelled to around 1.4 million after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled fighting in other areas of the Gaza Strip and sought shelter there during more than seven months of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They started by distributing flyers in the morning, and immediately began brutal artillery and aerial bombardment without giving people a chance to think or organise their belongings properly," Hamad said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AFP photographers saw dozens of families loading furniture and household items on trucks and fleeing from Rafah, many heading for Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, especially women and children, lingered on streets outside their homes before moving out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,034 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli forces on Tuesday seized and closed the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing into Egypt -- through which all fuel passes into Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are no medical services or humanitarian aid being provided to the displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip," said Mahmud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's civil defence agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we are witnessing in terms of killing and destruction reminds us of the early days of the aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Umm Mohammed Al-Mughayyir said she has had to move her family seven times to escape the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reached a point where we wish for death," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have people with special needs, elderly individuals, and children with us. Where do we go when the bombardment never stops, day and night?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Sunday that a full-scale Israeli assault on Rafah "cannot take place", insisting that it cannot be squared with international law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!" he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 34 people were killed and 16 more were missing in western Indonesia after flash floods and cold lava flow from one of the archipelago's most active volcanoes damaged homes, roads and mosques, local officials said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hours of heavy rain caused flooding in two districts -- Agam and Tanah Datar -- in West Sumatra province on Saturday evening, threatening thousands after it swept ash and large rocks down Mount Marapi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Until now our data shows that 34 people died: 16 in Agam and 18 in Tanah Datar. At least 18 others are injured. We are also still searching for 16 other people," West Sumatra disaster agency spokesman Ilham Wahab told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the search effort involved local rescuers, police, soldiers and volunteers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abdul Malik, head of Padang Search and Rescue Agency, told reporters three more people had died but they were yet to be confirmed by other authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Agam and Tanah Datar were hit with flash floods and cold lava flow at around 10:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Saturday, according to the Basarnas search and rescue agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 370,000 people live in Tanah Datar, where several mosques and a public pool were damaged, with large rocks and logs scattered on the ground, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lembah Anai, a popular tourist spot with a waterfall in Tanah Datar, a road connecting the cities of Padang and Bukittinggi was severely damaged and access for cars was cut off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aerial images of Tanah Datar showed roads covered by mud, with roofs and a mosque's minarets jutting out of the sea of brown mud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ilham said on Sunday that authorities were still receiving reports of missing people from relatives. (AFP)

    Hongkongers zone out as they compete to do nothing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Around a hundred Hongkongers who’ve mastered the art of doing nothing on Sunday gathered at the Cha Kwo Ling Promenade for a zoning out contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The “Chill and Relax Festival” is jointly organised by the Development Bureau, the Harbourfront Commission and the Playground Association to raise awareness over the importance of mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants were advised to stay still, and must not fall asleep or check their phones during the hour-long tournament. Their heart rates were measured regularly, and the person with the lowest and most stable heart rate would win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelvin, a laboratory worker, described the challenge as “a piece of cake”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A whole hour is nothing. I normally can do nothing for a few hours daily, so I think it is not that challenging. Practice makes perfect,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moris, a university student, said he was there to take a break from his studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Just to relax, honestly… because I completed my semester. I think [I am here] just for this atmosphere because it shows some, it's a symbol for difference, like the traditional China culture or the Buddha,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winnie, who joined the event with a group of hiking friends, said the occasion was perfect for Hongkongers to relax.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The majority of Hongkongers are always stressed out. So having some time to relax like this competition will be better,” she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top three candidates got an Apple Watch, Airpods and a HK$500 shopping coupon respectively.

    Protests won't stop until bombs stop in Gaza: analyst

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A protest encampment at George Washington University, in Washington DC. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752847_1_20240512160020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The growing wave of university campus protests around the world in solidarity with Gaza "will not go away" unless the bombs and bullets stop in the besieged enclave, a political commentator in Beijing said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said although the latest student demonstrations in Europe have been “milder” compared with the ones in the US, such movements will “only expand” as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eyes a “full-scale” assault of Rafah in Gaza – despite US warnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are over one million displaced Palestinians currently in the southern city of Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You cannot expect students in these institutions to stand idly by. They watched 35,000 civilians killed, most of whom were women and children. These images are on social media and people are reacting to them”, said Tangen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not a question of ‘do I support Hamas or do I support Israel’. Here, the issue is, people are dying. And such reactions will continue to grow as students realise that it’s not just their individual feelings, but collective feelings about this brutality.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests that first broke out at the Columbia University in New York before spreading across some 140 campuses in the US, have now reached universities in Europe, Australia, as well as India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel was added to the fire when President Joe Biden signed into law a military foreign aid package last month, which saw US$17 billion in arms going to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 2,500 campus demonstrators have been arrested in the US so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The interesting part of it is, you now hear President Joe Biden and many other politicians talking about ‘well, free speech is fine, but you cannot have disorder’. Where was that attitude when for a year Hong Kong suffered under these protests which were disrupting business and threatening people’s lives?” Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With many of the students calling for universities to sell off shares, assets, or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment, Tangen believes the students should be listened to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s very appropriate for the students [to make such requests]. They are not asking for armed intervention from the US in Gaza, they are simply saying ‘don't’ support an entity’ that’s [associated with] killing civilians. Stop sending bombs, weapon systems, and bullets to Israel, and then it [the protests] will stop.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Celebrations are underway across Hong Kong on Sunday to mark Mother's Day.
 <br>
  <br>
   Some restaurants RTHK spoke to said they logged a jump in business, as families flocked out to celebrate the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Others, meanwhile, bought flowers as a show of love and appreciation for their mothers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "By giving her flowers, I would say thank you to my mom for taking care of me over the years and helping me," 11-year-old Alex said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some tourists said they were quite impressed with the festivities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mrs Wong, a tourist from Singapore, said people in Hong Kong appear to be more excited about Mother's Day compared to her home country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the culture here in Hong Kong is pretty interesting. It's a bit different from Singapore, because I do see a lot of people carrying flowers around, so it's a bit different. So, I think they place more emphasis in Hong Kong,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another visitor from Shenzhen, Mr Tien, said he and his family are here for a day trip to mark the occasion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We come to Hong Kong for traveling and shopping, and brought our kid to walk around," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee wished all mothers joy and happiness on this special day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also posted a photo of himself and a colleague preparing flowers for "the two great mothers" in his life – namely his own mother and his wife – for the sacrifices they've made for his family.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland's Nemo won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel's participation during the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty-four-year-old Nemo's "The Code" won the highest score from nations' juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden's Malmo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world," a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nemo's journey towards realising their non-binary gender identity served as inspiration for the highly personal winning entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'The Code' is about the journey I started with the realisation that I am neither a man nor a woman," Nemo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Zagreb, a crowd gathered at a square to follow Croatia's Baby Lasagna, who finished second with 547 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-five nations competed Saturday but much of the focus has centred on the controversy of Israel being able to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Golan went on stage to perform her "Hurricane", both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside the arena, police pushed back protesters where more than a hundred demonstrators waved flags and chanted "Free Palestine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diverse Malmo is home to the country's largest community of Palestinian origin and according to police at least 5,000 people gathered to protest in the city in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Broadcasting Union, which oversees the event, confirmed in March that Golan would take part, despite calls for her exclusion from thousands of musicians around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same month, contestants from nine countries, including Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire. (AFP)

    'Improve working conditions to retain public nurses'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong without taking a licensing exam has its drawbacks, a lawmaker and a nursing professor said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Instead, they said it's more important to take away administrative work from existing local nurses at public hospitals and recognise their specialty to retain staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, non-locally trained nurses must pass the licensing examination administered by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong to be a qualified practitioner here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But under the government’s proposal which has been submitted to Legco for scrutiny, those trained outside of the city could come through a special registration pathway and obtain a full license, without taking the exam, after having worked “satisfactorily and competently” during a specified period in the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marking the International Nurses Day, DAB lawmaker Edward Leung noted that the attrition rate for nurses in the public sector reached 9.5 percent in 2023-24, saying the government must improve working conditions to keep staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it’s important to reduce their administrative burden and ensure their pay is on par with the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the plan to admit non-locally trained nurses could help alleviate manpower shortage at public hospitals in the longer run, it could add to the workload of local nurses in the initial phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we invite them to Hong Kong, in the very first period, we have to assign local nurses to assist them on doing their jobs and providing services. For this period, we are drawing manpower to assist the non-local nurses," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Li, vice-president of the Hong Kong Academy of Nursing, said the proposed special registration would only be a temporary measure to alleviate manpower shortage in the public sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The most important way is to offer recognition to those nurses who have specialty experience or specialty nursing qualification," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eventually, their job satisfaction should be improved and more nurses would be happy to stay at public hospitals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said offering more training spots for aspiring nurses at local institutions could be another way to alleviate manpower shortage.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says the government will do more to boost local spending and attract visitors. Photo courtesy: Paul Chan's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752830_1_20240512124656.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said an expansion of the individual travellers scheme will bring more overnight tourists to the SAR, adding that more will be done to boost spending and attract visitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the remarks a day after Beijing announced that people from eight more mainland cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This brings the total number of cities under the solo travel scheme to 59.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will stimulate the economy and improve cultural ties between the SAR and the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government and residents are deeply grateful to the central government for their support of Hong Kong. The move will encourage more visitors to stay overnight, boosting the local catering, retail, and hotel sectors," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will help our economy and improve the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also vowed to do more to lure talent to the city, and bring in more foreign capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the external challenges like rising geopolitical tensions and a high interest rate environment, Chan said he’s confident that Hong Kong’s economy will continue to expand with the staunch backing of the central authorities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said an injunction over the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong" helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme days after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the court has made it very clear what is allowed and what’s not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of this injunction was made very clear by the court. Using this song to incite seditious acts is illegal. It will definitely increase the public's awareness of this behaviour. What are the benefits? They are to provide a stronger deterrence and a prevention, and to make everyone understand what can and can't be done," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The justice chief said authorities had asked internet service providers such as Google to take down the song and are awaiting their response, adding that Google had said earlier that it would remove the song upon a court order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe everyone is very anxious and hope that [the internet service providers] will take actual action to respond as quickly as possible. Do they really follow the company’s policy [to align with court orders]? Do they really keep their word?" he questioned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said he hopes to see Hong Kong develop into a “food court” for legal services, catering not only for the needs of international companies, but also of grassroots citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The justice minister added that officials will continue to boost the city’s role as a mediation and arbitration centre.

    Weightlifting body apologises over chairwoman remarks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association says chairwoman Josephine Ip will be more cautious to ensure similar incidents won't happen again." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752825_1_20240512105507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's weightlifting and powerlifting body has apologised for an earlier remark made by its chairwoman which the government said was a suspected violation of the one-China principle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association also said Josephine Ip made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence when giving a speech on May 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup, Ip mentioned that the event, which featured competitors from the SAR and Chinese Taipei, had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the sports body explained that there were initially competitors from 16 countries and regions, but ultimately only representatives from 13 nations and two regions participated in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During her speech, chairwoman Ip found that the script did not match the actual number of participating teams. She also felt that the sentence was too long. So she simplified the sentence to 'this time, we have lifters and officials from 13 countries'," the association said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She mistakenly omitted 'regions' and created misunderstanding. This was a serious oversight."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also said the speech did not mean to imply "Hong Kong independence", and that it firmly supports and upholds the Basic Law and the one-China principle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairwoman will be more cautious and will review public speeches before giving them to ensure similar incidents won't happen again, the association added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The powerlifting and weightlifting association has submitted a report to the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China on Saturday.

    Nadal eyes French Open despite Rome exit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Rafael Nadal greets fans as he leaves the field after being defeated by Hubert Hurkacz during the Rome Open tennis tournament, in Italy. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752817_1_20240512092548.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal said on Saturday that he is leaning towards playing at the French Open despite his second-round elimination in Rome, as Novak Djokovic laughed off being hit by a bottle which briefly cast doubt on his continued participation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay-court icon Nadal had previously said that he would only play at the French Open, where he has won a record 14 titles, if he feels competitive after a raft of injury problems over the last two years which have left him languishing 305th in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with Hubert Hurkacz - winner in straight sets 6-1, 6-3 - seemed a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid, leaving a question mark hanging over his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision, as you can imagine, is not clear in my mind today. But if I have to say what's my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way, I am going to say to be in Roland Garros and try my best," Nadal told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Physically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say I'm not playing in the most important event of my tennis career. Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then quickly fell away, Hurkacz winning without dropping a service game and seemingly without breaking a sweat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner said that he was "98 percent" sure that he would never again grace the Roman clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one will ever have a record like him on this surface. He's just bigger than the sport at the end of the day," said Hurkacz. (AFP)

    Thousands join latest protest march in Georgia

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 50,000 opponents of a foreign agents bill marched peacefully in heavy rain through the Georgian capital on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as "agents of foreign influence", has touched off a rolling political crisis in Georgia, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand the bill be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd on Saturday waved Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should hear the free people of Georgia," said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city centre, which blocked much of the city's roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi's old town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, which is controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and its allies, will begin committee hearings on the bill's third and final reading on Monday. Opposition groups had called for a fresh wave of protests from Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crisis has pitted the Georgian Dream ruling party against a coalition of opposition parties, civil society, celebrities and the country's figurehead president, with mass demonstrations shutting down much of central Tbilisi almost nightly for more than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian opponents of the bill have dubbed it "the Russian law", comparing it to legislation used to target critics of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. The European Union, which granted Georgia candidate status in December, has said that the bill will pose a serious obstacle to further integration if passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian Dream says the bill will promote transparency and Georgian national sovereignty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgian Dream, has said the law is necessary to stop the West trying to use Georgians as "cannon fodder" in a confrontation with Russia. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Julian Alvarez slots home from the penalty spot in Manchester City's win over Fulham. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752804_1_20240512011419.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City hit the top of the Premier League with one week of the season remaining as two goals by Josko Gvardiol and one each for Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez sealed a 4-0 demolition of Fulham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Burnley were relegated from the Premier League after a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur left Vincent Kompany's side five points from the safety zone with one game remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's stroll in the London sunshine, their seventh successive league win and 16th consecutive victory over Fulham in all competitions, moved Pep Guardiola's a step closer an unprecedented fourth English title in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have 85 points from 36 games, with Arsenal on 83 from 36. Arsenal can regain top spot by beating Manchester United on Sunday but City, who play their game in hand at Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday, are now two wins away from history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the type of ruthless performance City inevitably produce down the stretch in title race and they now look likely to wrap up it up at home to West Ham United next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The great players enjoy playing with great pressure," Guardiola said. "These players in the last few years have been able to do it and we are again in the latter stages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Burnley, defeat in London meant a second relegation from the top flight in three seasons. The result also kept Spurs' slim hopes of qualifying for the Champions League alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In other action, a fine second half performance saw West Ham earn a 3-1 win against struggling Luton Town at the London Stadium while Yoane Wissa scored four minutes into added time to secure a 2-1 Premier League win for Brentford at Bournemouth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sean Longstaff's equaliser in first-half stoppage time earned Newcastle United a 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion while Abdoulaye Doucoure scored a first-half winner as Everton beat relegated Sheffield United 1-0 at a balmy Goodison Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doucoure's headed goal was the 101st bottom side United have conceded this season, one more than the previous record set by Swindon Town in 1993-94 in what was then a 42-game campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton, who are in 15th place with 40 points from 37 matches, have now won five home Premier League games in a row without conceding a goal for the first time. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="James Anderson will bow out after a 21-year test career. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752802_1_20240511233930.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's James Anderson will retire from test cricket after the first match of the series against West Indies at Lord's this year, he said on Saturday, ending a 21-year career in which he became the most successful ever pace bowler.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 41-year-old has taken 700 test wickets, behind only Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan (800) and Australia's Shane Warne (708) on the all-time list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having made his debut for England at Lord's in 2003, Anderson will finish his illustrious career at the same ground his 188th test, two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible 20 years representing my country, playing the game I've loved since I was a kid. I'm going to miss walking out for England so much," Anderson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed the "Burnley Express", Anderson did not say if he would continue playing county cricket for his club Lancashire who renamed the Pavilion End at Old Trafford as the James Anderson End.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm excited for the new challenges that lie ahead, as well as filling my days with even more golf," Anderson added. "Thank you to everyone who has supported me over the years, it's always meant a lot, even if my face often doesn't show it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's first match of a three-test series against the West Indies takes place from July 10-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Thompson, chair of the country's cricket board (ECB), said Anderson deserved a fitting send-off at the home of cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we'll ever see a bowler to match Jimmy again," Thompson said. (Reuters)

    SAR slams US lawmakers’ annual report

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Saturday condemned a report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said the commission’s “so-called ‘2023 Annual Report’ ... made biased, slandering and smearing remarks against the situation in the HKSAR”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government rejected the report’s comments on safeguarding national security; the administration of justice and rule of law; safeguarding of rights and freedoms and reform of the district councils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said: “The US is once again overriding the rule of law with politics and making unfounded and fact-twisting remarks. Such attempt to undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance is doomed to fail.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On calls in the report for sanctions on SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, the spokesperson added: “The so-called 'sanctions' as mentioned in the US' so-called report is a smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate the HKSAR officials safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On calls for the SAR’s economic and trade offices in the US to lose their certification, the spokesperson added: “The HKSAR Government despised the hypocrisy and barbaric act of US politicians driven only by their own political gains, fabricating groundless excuses, and attacking the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices' legitimate and rational economic and trade promotion activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement says the SAR government will “steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of 'one country, two systems'.”

 Large crowds of visitors and locals flocked to the Wan Chai waterfront on Saturday for the first in a series of spectacular drone shows put on by the Tourism Board.
 <br>
  <br>
   About one thousand drones took flight at 8pm for the ten-minute spectacular, which is designed to tie in with the Buddha's Birthday public holiday and the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, both of which fall on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drones soared up to sixty metres into the air, creating a pattern in the shape of the famous bun hill which is the centrepiece of the Cheung Chau festival's highlight, the bun-scrambling competition. They also formed the shape of what organisers called a "giant peaceful bun" some 30 metres in diameter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the spectators captured the moment on their smartphones and cameras.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other shapes adopted included lions and temples to signify good luck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And visitors to the show were also in luck: for those waiting to enjoy the drones, there was free ice cream at the Wan Chai Ferry Pier.

 Kouta Watanabe struck six minutes from time to give Yokohama F Marinos a 2-1 win over Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates in the first leg of the Asian Champions League final on Saturday, earning Harry Kewell's a slender advantage ahead of the return.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mohammed Abbas put Al-Ain in front after 12 minutes when he reacted quickest to a rebound after Soufiane Rahimi's shot was saved by Marinos goalkeeper William Popp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese side pulled level with 18 minutes remaining after Yan Matheus cut in from the right to deliver a curling cross that Asahi Uenaka headed beyond Khalid Eisa to leave the tie delicately poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watanabe grabbed the winner when he slotted in from close range after Ryo Miyaichi redirected Matheus' centre into his path, with the goal given after a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The teams meet again in the UAE on May 25 with the winners taking Asia's last remaining berth at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States next year. (Reuters)

    Report criticises Israel's use of US weapons in Gaza

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The war between Hamas and Israel has left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752759_1_20240511152122.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has issued a stunning criticism of Israel's use of American weapons in the Gaza war, after Israeli forces intensified operations around the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's main international ally said in a report released on Friday that it was "reasonable to assess" that Israel has used weapons in ways inconsistent with international humanitarian law during the seven-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the long-awaited State Department report said it could not reach "conclusive findings" and stopped short of blocking weapons shipments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two allies soured earlier in the week after US President Joe Biden said he would halt some arms deliveries if Israel went ahead with a full-scale assault on Rafah threatened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US has warned that the reputational damage Israel will suffer if it storms a city where an estimated 1.4 million civilians are sheltering will far outweigh any possible military gain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday that Gaza risked an "epic humanitarian disaster" if Israel launched a full-scale ground operation in Rafah, while France urged Israel to cease its operations in Rafah "without delay".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli premier has said repeatedly that Israel cannot defeat Hamas and eliminate any possibility of the militant group repeating its bloody October 7 attack without sending ground troops into Rafah in search of remaining Hamas fighters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu struck a defiant tone on Thursday, vowing: "If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House renewed its opposition on Friday but said it saw no major operation yet against the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're obviously watching it with concern, of course, but I wouldn't go so far as to say what we've seen here in the last 24 hours connotes or indicates a broad, large (or) major ground operation," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Israeli ground troops seized eastern areas of the city, including the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but they have yet to enter its main built-up area. (AFP)

    'All provincial capitals now under solo travel scheme'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beijing has expanded an individual travel scheme, allowing more mainland travelers to to visit and stay in Hong Kong and Macau. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752749_1_20240511150955.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday welcomed the news that the central government is adding eight more mainland cities, all provincial capitals, to a solo traveller scheme that will allow more mainland residents from remote areas to visit Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Beijing announced that eight more cities, namely Taiyuan of Shanxi province, Hohhot of Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin of Heilongjiang, Lhasa of Tibet, Lanzhou of Gansu, Xining of Qinghai, Yinchuan of Ningxia, and Urumqi of Xinjiang, will be covered under the “Individual Visit Scheme” - bringing the total number of cities under the scheme to 59.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme allows travellers from the mainland to visit and stay in Hong Kong and Macau on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups, for no more than seven days at a time. Residents from the eight cities could apply to visit the SARs from May 27th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “All these eight mainland provincial capitals have huge populations and strong economic growth, and are cities with high levels of consumption,” the chief executive said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such a further expansion means that all mainland provincial capitals are now covered under the scheme, and it will significantly help revive the economic activities of the city’s tourism, retail, catering, and hospitality sectors, while promoting the two-way exchanges between residents from Hong Kong and these provincial capitals,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the city’s tourism chief, Kevin Yeung, said the SAR will soon ramp up tourism promotion works in these cities, and launch new tour routes and products to woo travellers - in the face of changing tourism patterns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In May and June alone, a series of large-scale events are scheduled in Hong Kong, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, Buddha’s Birthday Carnival, Le French May, Chinese Culture Festival, as well as the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We look forward to having more visitors from different cities to explore Hong Kong in depth,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, the executive director of Hong Kong Tourism Association, said these eight cities aren't the largest mainland cities, but are growing strongly and their residents could be enticed by the SAR's vibrant retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Residents from these cities may well not have travelled much outside their regions, so there's more of a chance they could have higher demand in terms of travelling [to other regions] or for shopping,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu agreed about the consumer potential from the eight mainland cities, noting that most of these cities have an average per capita GDP of 100,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he warned that the SAR must provide more transport routes to these regions to spur tourism growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Even if we don't have direct flights to these cities yet, they can use the high-speed rail to travel here, [but] this could push us to open up more airline routes with these cities. Some airlines have already been doing that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing earlier expanded the scheme in February to add tourists from Xian and Qingdao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest expansion came just two days after Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office, told the city’s tourism chief that Hong Kong must further tap into the city’s rich tourism resources to revitalise offerings amid “profound changes” in the tourism industry.

    KMB won't rule out applying for fare hike

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) on Saturday said it's not ruling out applying for a fare hike this year, after operating costs rose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The higher costs also included its investment in electric buses, with a new batch of electric double-decker buses beginning a phased roll-out on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the franchised bus operator called for more government subsidies, saying it's incurred higher costs from its spending on electric buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said earlier that it wouldn't rule out seeking a fare hike, but Kenny Kan, head of the company's corporate communications and public affairs department, stressed that the increased costs from electric buses were just one factor in this. .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Costs - whether fuel or labour - have increased. As a bus operator, our fiscal robustness and sustainability is very important," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we think there's a need, we'll definitely apply for a fare hike... But in terms of how much the hike would be, we would consider the issue of affordability."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The KMB imported 52 electric double-decker buses, and 44 are currently in service.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's inflation rate quickened last month, according to official data released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent year-on-year in April, staying in positive territory for the third straight month, according to the  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)
